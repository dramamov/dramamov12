00:00:13.913 --> 00:00:18.284
I planned to live my whole life

00:00:19.519 --> 00:00:21.087
with this man.

00:00:25.158 --> 00:00:30.096
I made a solemn oath that day.

00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:35.168
That oath turned to happiness.

00:00:37.771 --> 00:00:40.206
And before long,
once I realized it...

00:00:43.209 --> 00:00:46.413
that happiness turned to regret.

00:01:19.112 --> 00:01:21.981
Regret turned to despair.

00:01:24.184 --> 00:01:27.720
And now I have one wish.

00:01:53.980 --> 00:01:56.649
- Please die, my beloved.
- Please die, my beloved.

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:19.599
PLEASE DIE MY BELOVED

00:03:19.666 --> 00:03:20.667
KUMABE ESTATE

00:03:20.733 --> 00:03:25.104
In preparation for remodeling Famiel,
our community-based retail space

00:03:25.171 --> 00:03:27.106
I'd like to propose a new concept.

00:03:27.373 --> 00:03:30.143
Family comfort,
a mall that brings people together.

00:03:30.777 --> 00:03:32.946
Life and family will intersect

00:03:33.079 --> 00:03:37.083
to provide a comfortable space
for all ages, young and old.

00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:40.353
Of course,
that includes loveless marriages.

00:03:41.754 --> 00:03:46.492
To learn more about Famiel
and how it can make families happy

00:03:46.559 --> 00:03:48.428
please turn your page.

00:03:48.795 --> 00:03:53.866
The mall has specialized facilities
to help families in their day-to-day.

00:03:54.467 --> 00:03:57.637
Our plan is that this place
will link everyone together...

00:03:57.870 --> 00:04:00.106
I'm impressed, Maya.

00:04:00.173 --> 00:04:01.941
That presentation was perfect.

00:04:02.075 --> 00:04:03.076
Thank you.

00:04:03.142 --> 00:04:05.612
I couldn't have done it
without your research, Kana.

00:04:05.979 --> 00:04:07.981
They'll totally approve this.

00:04:08.481 --> 00:04:11.484
And that will make you
the project lead.

00:04:12.151 --> 00:04:13.286
Who knows?

00:04:13.353 --> 00:04:15.088
It'll be fine.

00:04:15.588 --> 00:04:17.724
And here's why.

00:04:18.324 --> 00:04:23.062
I heard from a reliable source
that Chief Tachibana likes the idea.

00:04:23.463 --> 00:04:24.931
- Really?
- Yes.

00:04:29.869 --> 00:04:34.107
She's in the running to be director,
despite being so young and a mom.

00:04:36.576 --> 00:04:37.710
I heard

00:04:38.411 --> 00:04:42.482
her husband is super devoted to her
and helps out however he can.

00:04:42.949 --> 00:04:45.251
He takes the lead with their kid

00:04:45.752 --> 00:04:47.654
and supports her career too.

00:04:52.225 --> 00:04:54.227
Sounds like a lovely husband.

00:04:54.694 --> 00:04:56.029
Doesn't he?

00:05:19.919 --> 00:05:21.988
Riko, Are we still on for tonight?

00:05:22.055 --> 00:05:24.023
Wow, that's incredible.

00:05:24.090 --> 00:05:27.126
I could never work
and raise a kid at the same time.

00:05:27.193 --> 00:05:30.229
I can't believe you got a job again.

00:05:30.697 --> 00:05:33.399
Hey, wasn't it hard to look for jobs?

00:05:33.499 --> 00:05:35.501
No, not really.

00:05:35.968 --> 00:05:37.870
I used to do this job before.

00:05:38.104 --> 00:05:40.840
Oh, you have experience.

00:05:40.940 --> 00:05:42.408
What, Yurika?

00:05:42.475 --> 00:05:44.377
Thinking about going back to work?

00:05:44.544 --> 00:05:47.080
What? Oh, no.

00:05:47.146 --> 00:05:48.648
I'm just a housewife.

00:05:48.715 --> 00:05:50.450
What? I wouldn't say that.

00:05:50.717 --> 00:05:52.118
- Mom!
- Yes?

00:05:52.785 --> 00:05:53.786
Let's go home.

00:05:54.520 --> 00:05:55.521
Already?

00:05:55.588 --> 00:05:58.658
Yes, we need to get home before dad.

00:06:04.664 --> 00:06:06.366
Maya, Okay! Six o'clock at FREEDOM.

00:06:06.432 --> 00:06:07.834
A fear of going home?

00:06:08.234 --> 00:06:10.503
Right,
that was pretty widespread before.

00:06:10.937 --> 00:06:12.839
They say it's on the rise again.

00:06:13.339 --> 00:06:16.309
You know how more people
are telecommuting now, right?

00:06:17.110 --> 00:06:18.911
Dual-income homes in particular

00:06:18.978 --> 00:06:21.414
are struggling with staying at home.

00:06:21.781 --> 00:06:22.782
Gosh.

00:06:23.516 --> 00:06:26.519
If they're avoiding home,
that family's beyond repair.

00:06:26.853 --> 00:06:28.254
They should get divorced already.

00:06:30.823 --> 00:06:32.225
That's true.

00:06:32.592 --> 00:06:35.161
I'll prepare a list of interviewees.

00:06:35.294 --> 00:06:37.730
Please talk with them
and draft the article, Ms. Kagami.

00:06:38.297 --> 00:06:39.399
Got it.

00:06:39.732 --> 00:06:40.733
Thank you again.

00:06:41.601 --> 00:06:42.602
YURIKA

00:06:42.668 --> 00:06:45.505
I can't stay too late,
but I'll be there.

00:06:50.910 --> 00:06:53.146
Please raise your glasses.

00:06:53.212 --> 00:06:55.648
We're doing that again?
It's so embarrassing.

00:06:55.715 --> 00:06:57.049
It's not a big deal, right?

00:06:57.517 --> 00:06:58.751
Ready?

00:06:58.885 --> 00:07:01.687
- We survived another day! Cheers!
- We survived another day! Cheers!

00:07:01.754 --> 00:07:03.222
So persistent.

00:07:04.891 --> 00:07:06.058
Ever since college

00:07:06.492 --> 00:07:09.328
it was always the three of us.

00:07:11.197 --> 00:07:13.032
An unbreakable bond

00:07:13.900 --> 00:07:15.768
bound by the same sense of justice.

00:07:16.869 --> 00:07:23.476
And now, although we may lead
different lives from each other

00:07:24.677 --> 00:07:26.512
we have something in common
to talk about.

00:07:27.713 --> 00:07:28.714
Our husbands.

00:07:28.881 --> 00:07:31.684
Hey, has Garbie's attitude
changed lately?

00:07:32.084 --> 00:07:34.187
No, it's the same as always.

00:07:34.487 --> 00:07:37.924
It's hilarious how natural
it sounds when Maya says "Garbie."

00:07:37.990 --> 00:07:40.593
Hey, why is he "Garbie" again?

00:07:41.160 --> 00:07:43.596
- Since he's a weed?
- Really?

00:07:43.663 --> 00:07:47.066
He basically acts like garbage,
so we call him "Garbie."

00:07:47.133 --> 00:07:48.768
Oh, right, that's why.

00:07:50.603 --> 00:07:51.604
His breath...

00:07:53.206 --> 00:07:54.207
stinks.

00:07:55.875 --> 00:07:56.876
That man...

00:07:57.376 --> 00:08:00.413
He sighs right in front of me,
like it's on purpose.

00:08:01.080 --> 00:08:03.282
It smells like raw sewage every time.

00:08:04.116 --> 00:08:08.554
Wait, by garbage, you meant
his breath and not his attitude?

00:08:09.489 --> 00:08:10.623
It's both.

00:08:10.857 --> 00:08:12.725
Just divorce him already.

00:08:12.825 --> 00:08:14.961
Your garbage is doubling, you know.

00:08:15.027 --> 00:08:17.230
Stop convincing me.

00:08:17.597 --> 00:08:19.565
Whenever he opens his mouth

00:08:19.632 --> 00:08:22.301
I use the incense burner
you guys bought me

00:08:22.635 --> 00:08:24.737
to use incense to purify the air.

00:08:25.137 --> 00:08:27.807
You still have that
after all these years?

00:08:27.874 --> 00:08:29.108
How long ago was that?

00:08:29.275 --> 00:08:30.776
I'm not sure.

00:08:30.943 --> 00:08:32.445
I've been keeping it safe.

00:08:32.745 --> 00:08:35.848
Jeez, if only I could earn enough

00:08:35.915 --> 00:08:38.885
to raise Yuna into a proper adult.

00:08:39.352 --> 00:08:41.387
If only you hadn't quit your job.

00:08:41.454 --> 00:08:42.688
Right?

00:08:43.289 --> 00:08:44.290
What about you, Maya?

00:08:45.091 --> 00:08:48.361
Well, nothing's changed
on our end either.

00:08:49.362 --> 00:08:51.197
You have it nice, Riko.

00:08:51.564 --> 00:08:52.565
What?

00:08:52.632 --> 00:08:55.134
He's successful,
handsome, and devoted.

00:08:55.201 --> 00:08:56.869
I'm jealous.

00:08:59.272 --> 00:09:01.807
Oh, right. Let's take a photo.

00:09:02.041 --> 00:09:03.876
What? That's so random.

00:09:03.943 --> 00:09:05.645
It's fine. Get in here.

00:09:05.811 --> 00:09:07.713
- Get closer.
- Gosh.

00:09:07.780 --> 00:09:09.015
- Here goes.
- Really?

00:09:09.181 --> 00:09:11.551
- Three, two, one.
- Do it properly.

00:09:14.820 --> 00:09:16.656
I know what would make me happy.

00:09:17.590 --> 00:09:20.826
If my husband dies
and leaves me all his money.

00:09:22.295 --> 00:09:23.996
I wonder if he'll die soon.

00:09:24.664 --> 00:09:27.400
It's a terrible thing to say

00:09:28.100 --> 00:09:29.535
but I know how you feel.

00:09:29.702 --> 00:09:31.337
You two are terrifying.

00:09:33.205 --> 00:09:34.941
But you've got it good, Riko.

00:09:35.007 --> 00:09:36.008
Coke highball.

00:09:36.075 --> 00:09:37.243
- Right?
- Yes.

00:09:37.410 --> 00:09:39.078
He's so kind.

00:10:15.915 --> 00:10:16.916
I'm home.

00:10:18.250 --> 00:10:19.251
Okay.

00:10:25.257 --> 00:10:27.493
Wow, look at the time.

00:10:28.394 --> 00:10:30.763
Is he being snarky
because I was late?

00:10:53.085 --> 00:10:54.520
Oh, by the way...

00:10:57.289 --> 00:11:01.594
my family's having
a memorial service on Sunday.

00:11:02.995 --> 00:11:07.500
Oh, Sunday might be

00:11:08.668 --> 00:11:09.669
a bit tough.

00:11:12.571 --> 00:11:13.572
I see.

00:11:14.607 --> 00:11:15.608
Good night.

00:11:17.843 --> 00:11:19.245
What does he mean, "a bit tough"?

00:11:19.845 --> 00:11:21.380
He doesn't even have any friends.

00:11:24.817 --> 00:11:28.954
When did things get this way?

00:11:46.138 --> 00:11:49.341
Have you ever heard
of the superstring theory?

00:11:51.343 --> 00:11:54.346
S-Super string?

00:11:54.413 --> 00:11:55.948
Superstring theory.

00:11:56.315 --> 00:11:58.017
Superstring?

00:11:58.384 --> 00:12:02.822
W-Well, it's a theory that says
Earth is made up of 11 dimensions.

00:12:04.790 --> 00:12:05.791
For example

00:12:06.425 --> 00:12:08.928
this is one-dimensional, right?

00:12:08.994 --> 00:12:11.831
And this is two-dimensional.

00:12:12.064 --> 00:12:13.666
This is three-dimensional.

00:12:13.833 --> 00:12:15.701
It's the world we're in...

00:12:17.770 --> 00:12:20.639
I'm sorry, I'm boring you, aren't I?

00:12:21.440 --> 00:12:22.641
Well

00:12:22.775 --> 00:12:25.711
I'm not sure if I'm interested.

00:12:27.446 --> 00:12:29.081
But now I know

00:12:30.116 --> 00:12:33.385
that you're an interesting guy,
Mr. Komoto.

00:12:36.655 --> 00:12:39.925
No one has said
I'm interesting before.

00:12:39.992 --> 00:12:41.727
Well, I guess you could say

00:12:42.461 --> 00:12:45.231
I can tell you're a bit different.

00:12:52.772 --> 00:12:56.675
I don't usually come
to mixers like this.

00:12:58.177 --> 00:13:01.147
I didn't get your talk
about other dimensions

00:13:02.481 --> 00:13:06.619
but I'm happy
that you started talking to me.

00:13:07.987 --> 00:13:09.288
Thank you.

00:13:16.028 --> 00:13:17.029
It's...

00:13:18.731 --> 00:13:19.865
my first time.

00:13:22.001 --> 00:13:23.002
Going to a mixer.

00:13:30.709 --> 00:13:31.944
Congratulations.

00:13:32.444 --> 00:13:34.013
Wait, what?

00:13:34.713 --> 00:13:36.348
For what?

00:13:37.516 --> 00:13:39.418
Not sure. I just tried saying it.

00:13:41.687 --> 00:13:43.022
I think it's worth celebrating.

00:13:45.791 --> 00:13:46.992
Let's toast to it.

00:13:47.993 --> 00:13:49.328
- Cheers.
- Yes.

00:13:52.631 --> 00:13:54.033
MARUTA

00:13:54.099 --> 00:13:56.001
Gosh, what is this?

00:13:57.469 --> 00:14:00.506
- I've never had anything like it.
- Right?

00:14:01.740 --> 00:14:02.741
It's delicious.

00:14:03.142 --> 00:14:04.143
Yes.

00:14:04.210 --> 00:14:06.545
Wow, you're a black hole.

00:14:06.612 --> 00:14:07.746
Hey, stop that.

00:14:08.414 --> 00:14:09.615
Don't play with your food.

00:14:09.682 --> 00:14:11.884
I-I'm not playing around.

00:14:13.285 --> 00:14:15.588
What's your favorite oden ingredient?

00:14:19.658 --> 00:14:20.659
Fish cake.

00:14:22.061 --> 00:14:23.429
- I knew it.
- Yes.

00:14:23.863 --> 00:14:24.964
It's delicious.

00:14:27.166 --> 00:14:31.136
I thought that's how
everyone chooses who to marry.

00:14:34.940 --> 00:14:35.941
Bye, then.

00:14:36.709 --> 00:14:37.710
Bye.

00:14:39.311 --> 00:14:40.312
Good night.

00:14:41.313 --> 00:14:42.314
Good night.

00:14:45.718 --> 00:14:49.822
In this kind of situation,
the man usually turns first.

00:14:50.623 --> 00:14:51.624
Really?

00:15:00.699 --> 00:15:01.700
Maya!

00:15:11.477 --> 00:15:13.012
What is this?

00:15:15.514 --> 00:15:16.515
A handshake.

00:15:23.622 --> 00:15:26.058
I'll see you later then.

00:15:32.498 --> 00:15:35.601
Back then, even when I was alone

00:15:36.101 --> 00:15:37.636
it felt like we were together.

00:15:47.012 --> 00:15:48.247
And now...

00:15:53.485 --> 00:15:54.687
even when we're together

00:15:56.555 --> 00:15:58.157
I feel like I'm alone.

00:16:08.634 --> 00:16:11.437
Of course. Yes, of course.

00:16:11.503 --> 00:16:13.172
Yes.

00:16:14.940 --> 00:16:16.175
Have a good night.

00:16:16.608 --> 00:16:17.609
Thank you.

00:16:27.786 --> 00:16:29.088
You're finally back.

00:16:31.123 --> 00:16:32.591
Yuna went to bed a while ago.

00:16:33.625 --> 00:16:35.861
Don't you feel guilty
leaving me with the kid?

00:16:36.195 --> 00:16:38.063
- I'm sorry.
- Man, I'm beat.

00:16:38.130 --> 00:16:40.466
I'm exhausted after working all day

00:16:40.966 --> 00:16:42.468
but now I'm babysitting.

00:16:42.701 --> 00:16:43.802
You'd better be thankful.

00:16:44.203 --> 00:16:45.671
- I'm sorry.
- Well?

00:16:47.139 --> 00:16:48.240
Was it good?

00:16:49.108 --> 00:16:51.343
The drinks you bought with my money?

00:16:55.814 --> 00:16:57.282
I'm going to wash up.

00:16:57.883 --> 00:16:59.651
Get my beer and snacks ready.

00:17:28.847 --> 00:17:30.849
Heart rate rising.

00:17:31.050 --> 00:17:33.052
You have reached
160 beats per minute.

00:17:33.385 --> 00:17:34.420
I'm home.

00:17:36.955 --> 00:17:37.956
Welcome home.

00:17:43.228 --> 00:17:44.596
Why is it just one photo?

00:17:46.031 --> 00:17:47.666
I said one every ten minutes.

00:17:50.235 --> 00:17:51.937
I can't do that.

00:17:53.172 --> 00:17:56.275
It really was just you,
Maya, and Yurika, right?

00:17:56.742 --> 00:17:58.243
That's what I said.

00:18:14.660 --> 00:18:15.828
I love you.

00:18:17.362 --> 00:18:18.363
Riko.

00:18:37.249 --> 00:18:38.250
I'm home.

00:18:39.218 --> 00:18:40.219
Gosh.

00:18:41.553 --> 00:18:42.688
Did you come alone?

00:18:43.789 --> 00:18:44.790
Yes.

00:18:49.461 --> 00:18:51.597
You're having problems
with Mitsuhiro, right?

00:18:53.298 --> 00:18:55.000
I knew this would happen.

00:18:56.301 --> 00:18:57.302
Excuse me?

00:18:58.637 --> 00:18:59.671
Dear.

00:18:59.872 --> 00:19:01.039
Where's my belt?

00:19:01.273 --> 00:19:03.609
I'm sorry,
I'll get it when I'm done here.

00:19:05.077 --> 00:19:06.512
Oh, you're back?

00:19:06.845 --> 00:19:07.846
Yes.

00:19:24.496 --> 00:19:27.399
One day, you'll stop caring.

00:19:28.500 --> 00:19:29.501
What?

00:19:31.003 --> 00:19:32.905
If you want your marriage to go well

00:19:33.705 --> 00:19:35.474
just grin and bear it.

00:19:38.143 --> 00:19:39.711
After a long time together

00:19:40.479 --> 00:19:43.081
nothing your husband does
will bother you.

00:19:59.398 --> 00:20:02.568
Yasu, I'll leave your food here.

00:20:50.816 --> 00:20:53.352
I, as a woman

00:20:54.519 --> 00:20:56.388
don't want to end up like my mom.

00:21:02.995 --> 00:21:04.663
I want to get back

00:21:05.197 --> 00:21:08.433
the happy life
I had with my husband, Mitsuhiro.

00:21:28.787 --> 00:21:29.788
But...

00:21:43.201 --> 00:21:44.803
Wait, hold on.

00:21:45.404 --> 00:21:46.405
What?

00:21:47.439 --> 00:21:50.075
Put a condom on.
Today's not one of my safe days.

00:21:52.711 --> 00:21:55.013
You don't want a kid with me?

00:21:57.349 --> 00:21:58.350
I do.

00:21:59.151 --> 00:22:01.019
But not yet.

00:22:01.920 --> 00:22:04.089
Then when?

00:22:07.092 --> 00:22:09.328
When I get further in my career

00:22:10.729 --> 00:22:12.397
and my project gets accepted--

00:22:12.464 --> 00:22:13.699
And when is that?

00:22:17.502 --> 00:22:19.004
I don't know.

00:22:33.352 --> 00:22:36.722
Instead of talking things out
with my husband

00:22:37.956 --> 00:22:39.391
I'm running away.

00:22:42.794 --> 00:22:44.162
I want to talk things out.

00:22:45.731 --> 00:22:47.199
But I'm running away.

00:23:06.184 --> 00:23:07.552
It's perfume.

00:23:39.584 --> 00:23:41.486
Where were you at this hour?

00:23:44.322 --> 00:23:45.323
Nowhere.

00:23:45.791 --> 00:23:46.792
Did you...

00:23:49.594 --> 00:23:50.629
cheat on me?

00:23:57.569 --> 00:23:59.004
While I was out...

00:23:59.204 --> 00:24:01.640
In our home, on our bed!

00:24:07.579 --> 00:24:08.780
Did you cheat on me?

00:24:22.060 --> 00:24:26.097
All this time, I was the only one
going crazy thinking about us

00:24:26.164 --> 00:24:27.499
like an idiot!

00:24:56.828 --> 00:24:57.829
I'm sorry.

00:24:58.697 --> 00:24:59.698
I...

00:25:13.044 --> 00:25:19.084
I-I... accidentally...

00:25:22.888 --> 00:25:24.055
killed my husband.

00:25:46.077 --> 00:25:47.245
He's breathing.

00:25:49.748 --> 00:25:51.349
I'll call an ambulance.

00:25:51.416 --> 00:25:53.451
- No, stop! I...
- But...

00:25:55.420 --> 00:25:56.821
told him to die.

00:25:58.557 --> 00:26:00.025
I said, "Just die already!"

00:26:02.227 --> 00:26:03.695
and pushed him down.

00:26:13.204 --> 00:26:15.473
That hurt! Why is it so slippery?

00:26:15.540 --> 00:26:17.509
I'm sorry, I just waxed the floor.

00:26:17.576 --> 00:26:18.577
What?

00:26:18.643 --> 00:26:20.412
Why are you doing that at night?

00:26:20.478 --> 00:26:23.381
Plan when I'm coming home
and do it in the morning.

00:26:23.448 --> 00:26:26.751
I'm sorry, Yuna had an asthma attack,
so I rushed to the hospital--

00:26:26.818 --> 00:26:30.655
You're like my useless subordinates
at work. You piss me off.

00:26:36.361 --> 00:26:38.096
Don't smoke in here.

00:26:39.798 --> 00:26:40.932
Hey, stop that!

00:26:41.600 --> 00:26:43.034
That's important to me!

00:26:43.101 --> 00:26:45.103
You think this thing is important?

00:26:45.570 --> 00:26:47.939
You bought it
with my money anyway, right?

00:26:48.006 --> 00:26:49.140
You're wrong!

00:26:50.208 --> 00:26:51.343
"You're wrong!"

00:26:51.710 --> 00:26:53.678
You're so desperate, it's hilarious.

00:26:57.282 --> 00:26:58.283
Die.

00:26:58.617 --> 00:26:59.684
You say something?

00:27:01.353 --> 00:27:03.688
Die! Just die already!

00:27:25.276 --> 00:27:26.277
What?

00:27:28.213 --> 00:27:29.247
Every single day

00:27:29.981 --> 00:27:32.083
he made me a total fool.

00:27:36.087 --> 00:27:38.957
If he manages to wake back up

00:27:39.691 --> 00:27:41.626
will I get arrested?

00:27:45.263 --> 00:27:46.498
Will I get arrested?

00:27:46.998 --> 00:27:48.099
Am I a criminal?

00:27:49.367 --> 00:27:50.502
What about Yuna?

00:27:50.568 --> 00:27:53.271
Will I lose Yuna?
I won't let that happen!

00:27:53.338 --> 00:27:56.107
Stop yelling, Yurika! Calm down!

00:27:57.876 --> 00:28:00.545
I didn't do anything wrong...

00:28:02.080 --> 00:28:04.516
It's all his fault.

00:28:05.150 --> 00:28:08.820
Why do I have to suffer
because of him?

00:28:18.797 --> 00:28:19.864
I have to do it.

00:28:21.866 --> 00:28:23.435
Do it and hide the evidence.

00:28:31.376 --> 00:28:32.377
I'm in.

00:28:34.279 --> 00:28:35.346
I'll help.

00:28:38.950 --> 00:28:40.218
What are you saying?

00:28:40.985 --> 00:28:41.986
Where's Yuna?

00:28:42.554 --> 00:28:44.022
Sleeping in her room.

00:28:44.322 --> 00:28:45.323
Let's hurry.

00:28:45.924 --> 00:28:47.325
We'll finish by morning.

00:28:47.759 --> 00:28:50.295
- Hold on.
- Are you letting her do this alone?

00:28:57.102 --> 00:28:59.804
This is justice, right?

00:29:05.944 --> 00:29:07.078
Maya, get his legs.

00:29:10.982 --> 00:29:12.717
Yurika, clean up the persimmon seeds.

00:29:18.089 --> 00:29:19.591
And tape his mouth shut.

00:29:37.208 --> 00:29:38.409
What are you doing?

00:29:41.713 --> 00:29:44.582
Who are you people?

00:29:49.821 --> 00:29:53.491
Hey, do you think it's amnesia?

00:29:54.058 --> 00:29:55.126
Not sure.

00:29:55.593 --> 00:29:57.862
But I don't think he was acting.

00:29:57.929 --> 00:29:59.631
There's nothing to gain from that.

00:29:59.697 --> 00:30:00.732
That's true.

00:30:01.633 --> 00:30:04.002
But I'm glad we didn't kill him.

00:30:08.506 --> 00:30:09.507
Hey.

00:30:12.577 --> 00:30:13.611
If I told you

00:30:15.313 --> 00:30:17.682
that I'm killing my husband

00:30:19.417 --> 00:30:20.552
would you help me?

00:30:23.521 --> 00:30:24.522
What?

00:30:28.393 --> 00:30:29.394
Never mind.

00:30:29.928 --> 00:30:31.329
It's nothing.

00:30:31.663 --> 00:30:32.997
What did you just say?

00:30:33.264 --> 00:30:34.399
Oh, right.

00:30:34.465 --> 00:30:36.000
Veggies are expensive lately.

00:30:36.367 --> 00:30:39.771
- Hey, that's not what you said.
- The yen is getting stronger.

00:30:55.753 --> 00:30:56.754
I'm sorry.

00:30:57.622 --> 00:30:58.623
I...

00:31:01.993 --> 00:31:02.994
In that moment

00:31:04.095 --> 00:31:06.664
I wonder what he was going to say.

00:31:22.046 --> 00:31:23.047
Hello?

00:31:25.350 --> 00:31:26.351
What?

00:31:26.985 --> 00:31:27.986
Yurika said what?

00:31:31.656 --> 00:31:33.191
Okay, I'll head over now.

00:31:38.396 --> 00:31:39.397
I'm sorry.

00:31:40.498 --> 00:31:41.499
Let's talk later.

00:31:43.668 --> 00:31:45.870
Was he going to suggest divorce?

00:31:47.739 --> 00:31:48.740
Or maybe...

00:31:52.610 --> 00:31:54.045
We have to talk.

00:31:56.314 --> 00:31:57.448
So annoying.

00:32:00.585 --> 00:32:04.789
We decided to go
with Ishii's proposal this time.

00:32:08.293 --> 00:32:11.729
Komoto, you'll take on
Ishii's current tasks.

00:32:12.363 --> 00:32:13.598
Thank you, Komoto.

00:32:15.199 --> 00:32:17.802
Oh, right. You two joined
the company at the same time.

00:32:19.137 --> 00:32:21.272
Well, use your womanly insights

00:32:21.539 --> 00:32:23.808
and give Ishii your support, okay?

00:32:25.476 --> 00:32:26.477
Yes, sir.

00:32:27.345 --> 00:32:28.379
Thank you.

00:32:33.885 --> 00:32:35.086
Can't accept it?

00:32:36.321 --> 00:32:37.388
Chief Tachibana.

00:32:38.723 --> 00:32:43.194
This renewal project
is going to be three years, right?

00:32:44.162 --> 00:32:49.467
Can you guarantee that you'll stay
and take the lead the whole time?

00:32:50.601 --> 00:32:51.636
As the leader?

00:32:53.404 --> 00:32:54.639
What do you mean?

00:32:56.507 --> 00:32:58.209
Since you're a woman

00:32:58.509 --> 00:32:59.911
and married on top of that

00:33:00.244 --> 00:33:03.982
you might have a child and leave us.

00:33:04.215 --> 00:33:06.551
They doubt
that you'll even stay focused.

00:33:07.585 --> 00:33:10.388
It's normal for them
to think it's all a risk.

00:33:10.888 --> 00:33:11.889
A risk?

00:33:14.425 --> 00:33:16.961
Did you think
you had everyone's trust?

00:33:26.704 --> 00:33:27.972
I want kids.

00:33:28.940 --> 00:33:32.710
But I don't know
if I want my husband's anymore.

00:33:33.911 --> 00:33:37.281
Should I get divorced
and find a new partner?

00:33:38.282 --> 00:33:40.118
Is there still time at my age?

00:33:44.522 --> 00:33:48.593
Yurika, Apparently,
he doesn't even remember me?

00:33:48.693 --> 00:33:52.930
Puff Puff, the first baby panda
of the Reiwa era, turned one...

00:33:52.997 --> 00:33:54.465
"Reiwa"?

00:33:55.033 --> 00:33:56.134
What's that mean?

00:33:56.634 --> 00:34:00.104
What? You don't know?
But you're an adult.

00:34:01.406 --> 00:34:02.740
But I'm an adult...

00:34:09.647 --> 00:34:11.616
I'm going on my business trip.

00:34:12.417 --> 00:34:13.418
Safe travels.

00:34:14.819 --> 00:34:16.888
I'm sorry I couldn't take you.

00:34:20.792 --> 00:34:22.794
You're writing at home
all day, right?

00:34:23.528 --> 00:34:24.529
Yes.

00:34:25.963 --> 00:34:26.964
Got it.

00:34:28.299 --> 00:34:29.300
Good luck.

00:34:50.721 --> 00:34:51.856
Okay!

00:34:51.923 --> 00:34:55.793
Three, two, one, smile!

00:34:56.961 --> 00:34:58.262
Okay!

00:34:58.329 --> 00:34:59.630
Thank you!

00:34:59.697 --> 00:35:00.698
No problem.

00:35:00.765 --> 00:35:02.533
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

00:35:02.600 --> 00:35:03.668
Enjoy Japan!

00:35:03.734 --> 00:35:04.936
Thank you!

00:35:11.008 --> 00:35:14.579
RIKO

00:35:16.581 --> 00:35:18.916
Enjoy being at home, Riko.

00:35:46.444 --> 00:35:47.445
Hello?

00:36:00.791 --> 00:36:02.126
Hello?

00:36:02.527 --> 00:36:04.228
I apologize for the sudden call.

00:36:04.729 --> 00:36:07.365
- Yes?
- I'm Kawada from Nitto Solutions.

00:36:07.932 --> 00:36:09.333
From my husband's company?

00:36:09.534 --> 00:36:11.035
Thank you for watching over him.

00:36:11.269 --> 00:36:13.304
Yes, this is Komoto's wife.

00:36:13.871 --> 00:36:16.073
Is he at home right now?

00:36:16.841 --> 00:36:19.577
I'm sorry, one moment.

00:36:26.817 --> 00:36:28.419
He's still not back yet.

00:36:28.986 --> 00:36:30.054
I see.

00:36:30.721 --> 00:36:32.823
Actually, he hasn't come
to work today.

00:36:33.090 --> 00:36:34.091
What?

00:36:35.159 --> 00:36:38.729
He hasn't contacted us,
and he won't pick up our calls.

00:36:39.297 --> 00:36:42.667
This has never happened before,
so we're a bit worried.

00:36:43.568 --> 00:36:44.569
I understand.

00:36:45.069 --> 00:36:47.538
I'll try giving him a call.

00:36:47.905 --> 00:36:49.473
I'll be sure to let him know.

00:36:49.807 --> 00:36:51.442
Yes, I apologize.

00:36:51.676 --> 00:36:52.743
Goodbye.

00:37:01.485 --> 00:37:05.423
The person you are calling
cannot answer right now.

00:37:05.590 --> 00:37:06.891
Where is he?

00:37:07.592 --> 00:37:10.027
When did he leave the house?

00:37:11.195 --> 00:37:12.930
The last time I saw him was...

00:37:15.766 --> 00:37:16.767
I'm sorry.

00:37:18.236 --> 00:37:19.237
I...

00:37:28.613 --> 00:37:30.014
If only...

00:37:33.050 --> 00:37:35.052
If only you'd just die!

00:38:07.218 --> 00:38:08.219
What?

00:38:20.665 --> 00:38:22.266
If only he'd just die...

00:38:27.571 --> 00:38:29.240
My glass.

00:38:29.307 --> 00:38:32.209
I'll retrain you
into my ideal husband.

00:38:32.276 --> 00:38:35.112
I'll never forgive him
for cheating on me.

00:38:35.179 --> 00:38:36.747
Something smells off.

00:38:36.814 --> 00:38:38.449
I seriously wish he'd die.

00:38:38.516 --> 00:38:40.318
The three of us can do anything.

00:38:40.384 --> 00:38:41.585
Riko!
