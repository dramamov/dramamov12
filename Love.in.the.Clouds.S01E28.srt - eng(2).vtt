[Episode 28]

00:01:34.150 --> 00:01:36.020
My Lord, did you drain your own power to refine

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:37.660
the Golden Millet Dream directly?

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:39.850
Planting the Golden Millet Dream within someone

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:41.180
takes an enormous amount of spiritual power,

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:43.620
and the process feels like being flayed alive.

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:45.690
You did all this so Ming Yi

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:47.210
could take it directly,

00:01:47.230 --> 00:01:47.900
didn't you?

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:50.130
Did you really go that far?

00:01:57.040 --> 00:01:58.850
Sorry, Master.

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:01.380
I made an oath

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:02.740
and promised you

00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:04.570
not to let Golden Millet Dream appear again,

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:07.380
but

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:11.010
I must save her.

00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:37.690
It's boring if you don't go crazy once.

00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:39.340
I...

00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:42.010
I really don't know what to say.

00:03:42.310 --> 00:03:44.170
You said you'd use the Golden Millet Dream as bait

00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:45.380
to avenge Fairy Bo,

00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:46.610
so you hadn't used it on yourself.

00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:47.890
And now, you suddenly

00:03:47.910 --> 00:03:49.130
offered it to someone.

00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:50.890
You exhausted a lot of your spiritual power,

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:52.780
so you probably cannot use the Spirit Well anymore.

00:03:53.520 --> 00:03:55.100
I'm worried that you'd suddenly do something rash

00:03:55.120 --> 00:03:56.170
at the Qingyun Tournament,

00:03:56.310 --> 00:03:58.100
the Heavenly Grief in you relapse again suddenly,

00:03:58.240 --> 00:03:59.570
but you can't even use the Spirit Well.

00:03:59.750 --> 00:04:01.380
So you'll just die suddenly.

00:04:02.150 --> 00:04:04.130
If I had known, I shouldn't have listened to you

00:04:04.150 --> 00:04:05.980
and killed Ming Yi.

00:04:13.310 --> 00:04:14.100
All right.

00:04:17.800 --> 00:04:19.730
It's my first time hearing you say so many things.

00:04:20.630 --> 00:04:21.250
Drink a little.

00:04:22.310 --> 00:04:23.540
This is just temporary.

00:04:24.040 --> 00:04:25.290
Spirit Well isn't gone.

00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:31.220
I don't know what to say.

00:04:31.750 --> 00:04:32.290
I don't agree

00:04:32.310 --> 00:04:33.850
with you and Ming Yi being together.

00:04:34.120 --> 00:04:35.900
Now that we have given her so much as the betrothal gift,

00:04:36.070 --> 00:04:37.540
you must marry her no matter what!

00:04:37.560 --> 00:04:38.250
Well said!

00:04:38.480 --> 00:04:39.490
Do you think I was serious?

00:04:39.510 --> 00:04:40.140
Of course.

00:04:40.270 --> 00:04:40.850
I...

00:04:44.270 --> 00:04:45.580
I'm sure she knows everything now.

00:04:46.480 --> 00:04:47.930
I hope she is sensible

00:04:48.160 --> 00:04:49.730
and will marry you immediately to repay you.

00:04:50.360 --> 00:04:51.020
Buxiu,

00:04:51.560 --> 00:04:52.250
no one offers a medicine

00:04:52.270 --> 00:04:53.850
and expects the other person to marry him in return.

00:04:54.120 --> 00:04:54.980
Besides,

00:04:55.680 --> 00:04:57.170
why must she repay me?

00:04:58.120 --> 00:04:59.980
Did you not even tell her that?

00:05:01.560 --> 00:05:02.140
I...

00:05:02.920 --> 00:05:04.370
You are not giving her an ordinary medicine.

00:05:04.390 --> 00:05:05.660
You are giving her your life!

00:05:08.750 --> 00:05:10.660
Indeed, she doesn't know it was me who saved her.

00:05:10.830 --> 00:05:11.780
She thought

00:05:11.870 --> 00:05:13.100
it was Situ Ling

00:05:14.040 --> 00:05:15.290
who exchanged his heart's blood

00:05:15.480 --> 00:05:16.660
for her lifespan.

00:05:17.360 --> 00:05:18.340
What in the world?

00:05:19.240 --> 00:05:20.610
I don't know what to say.

00:05:20.870 --> 00:05:22.140
Heart's blood

00:05:22.160 --> 00:05:23.610
can only extend one's lifespan for a few hours.

00:05:23.750 --> 00:05:24.610
Did she think

00:05:24.630 --> 00:05:26.020
it could repair the spiritual veins destroyed by Heavenly Grief?

00:05:26.600 --> 00:05:28.660
My Lord, Ming Yi isn't a fool.

00:05:28.680 --> 00:05:29.810
Why would she believe that?

00:05:31.510 --> 00:05:33.340
Situ Ling must have acted like a magnanimous savior too.

00:05:34.310 --> 00:05:35.340
Oh, that was my heart's blood.

00:05:35.360 --> 00:05:36.900
I stabbed myself for you.

00:05:37.070 --> 00:05:37.900
Ming Yi was charmed.

00:05:37.920 --> 00:05:38.930
And so touched she was that...

00:05:45.830 --> 00:05:46.980
My Lord, have you told Ming Yi

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:48.540
about Situ Ling's real identity?

00:05:49.070 --> 00:05:49.810
Not yet.

00:05:51.190 --> 00:05:51.900
I understand.

00:05:53.070 --> 00:05:54.250
I'll go and kill Situ Ling now.

00:05:54.270 --> 00:05:55.250
What do you understand?

00:05:55.680 --> 00:05:56.250
Come back.

00:05:58.390 --> 00:05:59.540
You're not going to tell Ming Yi

00:05:59.560 --> 00:06:00.660
Situ Ling's true identity

00:06:00.800 --> 00:06:02.100
and you won't allow me to kill Situ Ling.

00:06:02.510 --> 00:06:03.370
Now, you're letting Ming Yi

00:06:03.390 --> 00:06:04.700
think it was Situ Ling who saved her.

00:06:05.120 --> 00:06:06.900
How can you marry her if you do that?

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:09.100
Ming Yi isn't that kind of person.

00:06:10.160 --> 00:06:11.540
She won't marry someone

00:06:11.830 --> 00:06:12.900
because they saved her.

00:06:14.160 --> 00:06:15.340
It's pointless.

00:06:16.040 --> 00:06:16.850
I want her

00:06:19.120 --> 00:06:20.170
to marry me willingly.

00:06:50.560 --> 00:06:51.340

00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:00.010
What a coincidence.

00:12:00.360 --> 00:12:01.340
Did you come here to eat, too?

00:12:03.030 --> 00:12:03.730
Let's eat together.

00:12:13.750 --> 00:12:15.940
The new dishes taste better than the old ones.

00:12:16.550 --> 00:12:17.340
Try them, Ming Yi.

00:12:29.720 --> 00:12:31.650
Only two people can sit here.

00:12:35.630 --> 00:12:36.770
Why are you still here then?

00:12:37.270 --> 00:12:38.100
Don't you think you're a nuisance?

00:12:45.550 --> 00:12:46.100
Here.

00:12:46.360 --> 00:12:47.300
This is your favorite.

00:12:49.030 --> 00:12:50.220
You should try this instead.

00:12:52.670 --> 00:12:54.420
Something that you haven't tried before is always better.

00:12:57.360 --> 00:12:58.250
Let me try it.

00:13:09.870 --> 00:13:10.730
It tastes so bad.

00:13:30.080 --> 00:13:30.770
It's rancid.

00:13:42.790 --> 00:13:43.370
Fine.

00:13:43.630 --> 00:13:45.530
Enjoy the food. Don't waste anything.

00:13:45.550 --> 00:13:46.250
I'll be leaving.

00:13:46.750 --> 00:13:48.180
They will pay for me.

00:13:48.670 --> 00:13:49.370
Sure.

00:13:53.910 --> 00:13:55.530
Immortal Situ, thanks for paying the bill.

00:13:56.440 --> 00:13:57.580
However, I must remind you

00:13:58.510 --> 00:14:00.490
that you know who you truly are.

00:14:05.030 --> 00:14:07.650
If you insist on approaching my wife, Ming Yi,

00:14:08.080 --> 00:14:09.530
and bring trouble to her,

00:14:10.270 --> 00:14:11.820
I won't forgive you.

00:14:12.840 --> 00:14:13.820
What do you mean?

00:14:24.080 --> 00:14:25.130
Sir, pack them for me.

00:14:25.550 --> 00:14:26.100
Sure.

00:14:39.910 --> 00:14:40.850
Buy two, get one free!

00:14:41.960 --> 00:14:43.820
Final two pairs!

00:14:43.840 --> 00:14:44.420
Thank you.

00:14:44.550 --> 00:14:45.250
Take care.

00:14:50.630 --> 00:14:51.250
Sorry.

00:14:52.750 --> 00:14:53.490
Watch where you're going!

00:14:57.510 --> 00:14:58.420
Fresh flowers!

00:14:59.720 --> 00:15:00.820
Take a look at some fresh flowers!

00:15:07.720 --> 00:15:08.490
Excuse me.

No matter how much I've done

00:17:00.440 --> 00:17:01.580
and how long I've waited,

00:17:05.920 --> 00:17:08.180
when I see her eyes again,

00:17:10.480 --> 00:17:11.530
they

00:17:13.640 --> 00:17:15.010
are still the same as before.

00:17:17.270 --> 00:17:18.490
She does not see me.

00:17:28.680 --> 00:17:29.330
My Lord,

00:17:30.550 --> 00:17:32.570
I will never betray you.

00:17:33.200 --> 00:17:34.330
If you want,

00:17:34.830 --> 00:17:36.730
I can share my lifespan with you.

00:17:39.640 --> 00:17:40.530
Is it worth it?

00:17:44.750 --> 00:17:48.860
You did so much for Ming Yi, but it was all in vain.

00:17:51.000 --> 00:17:52.570
Have you asked yourself the same question as well?

00:17:54.920 --> 00:17:56.700
I thought it was worth it in the beginning.

00:18:00.440 --> 00:18:02.940
But I asked myself again and again today,

00:18:07.510 --> 00:18:09.090
what can I do for her

00:18:12.110 --> 00:18:13.620
that I haven't done yet?

00:18:15.680 --> 00:18:17.700
I could even give up my life,

00:18:19.310 --> 00:18:20.380
but she still

00:18:23.160 --> 00:18:24.380
doesn't care about me.

00:18:43.240 --> 00:18:44.570
Who hurt you so badly?

00:18:50.920 --> 00:18:53.290
She set up the Yaoguang Mountain Fire Array.

00:18:53.640 --> 00:18:57.090
I duped her with a secret skill of Yousu Fox Tribe

00:18:57.590 --> 00:18:58.490
and made a copy.

00:18:58.640 --> 00:18:59.860
They won't find out.

00:19:06.620 --> 00:19:08.460
[Bo's Medical Classics]

00:19:10.590 --> 00:19:11.330
My Lord,

00:19:12.070 --> 00:19:14.490
it's time to think about yourself now.

00:19:15.270 --> 00:19:17.900
You can use this to complete His Majesty's mission

00:19:18.110 --> 00:19:20.730
or use it to create the Golden Millet Dream.

00:19:22.200 --> 00:19:23.730
I wanted to use the Golden Millet Dream

00:19:24.790 --> 00:19:25.730
and grew spiritual veins in the past

00:19:27.920 --> 00:19:29.420
for her.

00:19:31.200 --> 00:19:33.940
If I can't be with her,

00:19:37.270 --> 00:19:39.090
all of this is meaningless.

00:19:42.590 --> 00:19:43.900
Only by obtaining spiritual veins

00:19:44.480 --> 00:19:45.530
and rising to a high position

00:19:46.070 --> 00:19:48.620
will we not be bullied by anyone else.

00:19:49.680 --> 00:19:50.490
My Lord,

00:19:51.830 --> 00:19:53.460
you can become the person you want to become

00:19:54.550 --> 00:19:56.620
for your own sake.

00:20:02.790 --> 00:20:03.900
Can I?

00:20:33.790 --> 00:20:34.460
You're back.

00:20:35.070 --> 00:20:35.730
Yes.

00:20:36.200 --> 00:20:37.330
I followed Situ Ling

00:20:37.510 --> 00:20:38.620
to the cliff by the border.

00:20:39.110 --> 00:20:40.180
However, he used a spell

00:20:40.400 --> 00:20:41.290
to cover all his tracks.

00:20:42.480 --> 00:20:43.090
It's fine.

00:20:44.400 --> 00:20:45.700
Go to the tea gathering with me after this.

00:20:46.590 --> 00:20:48.420
Keep a close eye on Zhushui's and Yaoguang Mountain's movements.

00:20:49.160 --> 00:20:50.730
Once they make a move,

00:20:51.440 --> 00:20:52.700
they'll surely give themselves away.

00:20:53.240 --> 00:20:54.530
We just need to wait for them to make a mistake.

00:20:56.510 --> 00:20:57.620
At least for now,

00:20:58.550 --> 00:21:00.250
Situ Ling bears no malice toward Ming Yi.

00:21:00.720 --> 00:21:02.620
Maybe not toward Ming Yi,

00:21:03.200 --> 00:21:04.980
but surely toward you.

00:21:07.160 --> 00:21:08.940
You really are talking more and more now.

00:21:10.400 --> 00:21:11.140
Isn't that good?

00:21:18.830 --> 00:21:19.490
Good.

00:21:20.680 --> 00:21:21.380
Very good.

00:21:22.440 --> 00:21:24.940
You feel more human now.

00:21:26.480 --> 00:21:27.090
My Lord,

00:21:27.110 --> 00:21:28.700
did you experience something good today?

00:21:37.880 --> 00:21:39.180
Even if you don't tell me, I can guess it.

00:21:40.200 --> 00:21:41.900
I'm sure it's related to Fairy Ming Yi.

00:21:48.110 --> 00:21:50.140
Did Fairy Ming Yi finally decide

00:21:50.160 --> 00:21:51.180
to marry you?

00:21:53.160 --> 00:21:54.010
I told you so.

00:21:54.030 --> 00:21:54.900
Your previous method

00:21:54.920 --> 00:21:56.620
of pretending to be cold won't work.

00:21:57.200 --> 00:21:58.140
You need to tell her

00:21:58.270 --> 00:21:59.860
so she knows your true feelings.

00:22:03.880 --> 00:22:05.330
I want to tell her my feelings as well.

00:22:08.480 --> 00:22:09.940
If only I had a chance.

00:22:12.000 --> 00:22:13.980
What did you say, My Lord?

00:22:19.310 --> 00:22:20.900
I said you were right.

00:22:22.830 --> 00:22:24.050
You were right.

00:22:27.310 --> 00:22:28.770
You haven't fallen for anyone before.

00:22:28.790 --> 00:22:30.010
You are clueless about many things.

00:22:30.310 --> 00:22:31.090
In my opinion,

00:22:31.110 --> 00:22:32.620
you should meet some

00:22:32.640 --> 00:22:33.460
female dragons,

00:22:33.480 --> 00:22:34.140
butterflies,

00:22:34.160 --> 00:22:35.180
or phoenixes.

00:22:35.680 --> 00:22:37.050
Don't be so violent to the point

00:22:37.350 --> 00:22:38.290
that you've turned into a fool.

00:22:44.900 --> 00:22:46.440
Take a look.

00:22:47.590 --> 00:22:48.700
Take a look, miss.

00:22:50.880 --> 00:22:52.690
- I want this. - Sure. Let me wrap it up for you.

00:22:52.690 --> 00:22:53.350
Osmanthus cake!

00:22:53.350 --> 00:22:54.010
Come again.

00:22:54.270 --> 00:22:54.810
Sure.

00:22:58.110 --> 00:22:59.900
Zheng Tiao is such a jerk.

00:23:00.510 --> 00:23:02.010
I sent him

00:23:02.110 --> 00:23:03.940
a total of 200 missives.

00:23:05.510 --> 00:23:07.940
Unless he's dead,

00:23:08.310 --> 00:23:10.860
why would he reply to me with just a "I'm fine"?

00:23:10.880 --> 00:23:11.860
He's mostly dead.

00:23:12.510 --> 00:23:13.730
Tell me.

00:23:14.440 --> 00:23:16.420
Do you think he is married already?

00:23:17.590 --> 00:23:18.620
Or is he

00:23:19.070 --> 00:23:20.620
cheating on me?

00:23:21.310 --> 00:23:23.530
I'm Jixing Abyss's fairy.

00:23:23.680 --> 00:23:25.420
Am I being lied to by this brat?

00:23:25.440 --> 00:23:26.290
No.

00:23:27.110 --> 00:23:27.810
You won't.

00:23:27.960 --> 00:23:28.570
I asked you to drink

00:23:28.590 --> 00:23:29.570
but I didn't ask you to get drunk.

00:23:29.920 --> 00:23:31.010
- Slowly. - Be careful.

00:23:33.480 --> 00:23:34.250
Mind her head.

00:23:35.160 --> 00:23:35.730
Lie down.

00:23:35.750 --> 00:23:37.980
All right. You can follow me to the tea gathering

00:23:38.310 --> 00:23:39.050
and ask him about it.

00:23:40.720 --> 00:23:42.570
How are you getting along

00:23:43.030 --> 00:23:43.810
with Ji Bozai?

00:23:44.750 --> 00:23:45.570
Well...

00:23:46.000 --> 00:23:46.940
Well...

00:23:48.790 --> 00:23:49.380
I...

00:23:50.270 --> 00:23:52.700
The Qingyun Tournament is the priority now.

00:23:54.110 --> 00:23:55.700
The Qingyun Tournament is the priority.

00:23:56.160 --> 00:23:57.860
Men can go away.

00:23:57.880 --> 00:23:58.620
Go away.

00:23:58.920 --> 00:23:59.530
Cheers.

00:23:59.880 --> 00:24:00.570
Cheers.

00:24:00.590 --> 00:24:01.530
You should sleep.

00:24:08.790 --> 00:24:11.180
Ming Yi, something just came to my mind.

00:24:11.830 --> 00:24:13.660
Why don't you join Shouhua Academy

00:24:13.880 --> 00:24:15.090
as an official warrior?

00:24:19.400 --> 00:24:21.700
There's something wrong with the wine.

00:24:21.960 --> 00:24:22.570
What?

00:24:22.590 --> 00:24:23.140
My head hurts.

00:24:23.720 --> 00:24:24.490
Ming Yi.

00:24:25.680 --> 00:24:26.570
Ming Yi.

00:24:29.270 --> 00:24:30.180
Ming Yi!

00:24:52.200 --> 00:24:53.140
Master Ming Yi.

00:24:54.160 --> 00:24:55.490
Have some tea and take a break.

00:25:00.200 --> 00:25:00.940
Chen Xi,

00:25:01.200 --> 00:25:02.660
I've always wanted to ask you this.

00:25:02.830 --> 00:25:04.250
I didn't take you in as my disciple.

00:25:04.550 --> 00:25:05.980
Why do you keep calling me your master?

00:25:06.310 --> 00:25:07.180
The Empress said

00:25:07.400 --> 00:25:08.940
you came to Shouhua Academy

00:25:09.200 --> 00:25:10.620
to teach me forging.

00:25:10.830 --> 00:25:12.250
Therefore, you are my master.

00:25:14.000 --> 00:25:14.570
Sit.

00:25:16.160 --> 00:25:18.860
There are many warriors

00:25:19.070 --> 00:25:20.050
who want to participate in battles.

00:25:20.680 --> 00:25:22.180
Why do you want to become a forger?

00:25:25.070 --> 00:25:26.660
My brother was also a forger.

00:25:27.350 --> 00:25:28.570
He was attacked by Gudiao

00:25:30.310 --> 00:25:31.660
when he tried to save his friends

00:25:32.030 --> 00:25:34.420
and died in the Qingyun Tournament.

00:25:42.720 --> 00:25:44.660
Your brother might no longer be around

00:25:45.480 --> 00:25:47.180
but the skills he taught you

00:25:47.510 --> 00:25:48.530
allow you

00:25:48.550 --> 00:25:50.860
to make more powerful weapons to help others,

00:25:52.240 --> 00:25:54.730
so that those with weak spiritual powers

00:25:54.920 --> 00:25:56.980
can protect the people they love.

00:26:00.110 --> 00:26:01.050
From today onward,

00:26:01.790 --> 00:26:04.380
I will monitor you daily so you'll work hard

00:26:04.720 --> 00:26:06.700
and forge more powerful weapons

00:26:06.790 --> 00:26:07.730
to protect Jixing Abyss.

00:26:08.240 --> 00:26:09.090
Are you ready?

00:26:12.110 --> 00:26:12.980
I'm ready!

Something urgent happened back home. I'm here to bid farewell.

appreciate this favor?

00:26:57.510 --> 00:26:58.290
Of course.

00:26:58.310 --> 00:26:59.460
Then, I'm sure you still remember

the same way.

00:30:39.880 --> 00:30:40.900
Enough.

you just want her to be safe?

It seems like Ming Xin

was the one who poisoned you with Heavenly Grief.

00:37:28.190 --> 00:37:30.010
The truth is not surprising at all.

00:37:32.320 --> 00:37:33.690
The missing piece of the Recording Mirror

00:37:34.000 --> 00:37:35.130
is probably with Ming Xin.

Yes.

He came to Jixing Abyss for the Golden Millet Dream.

00:38:10.960 --> 00:38:13.940
He saved me after I came out of Wugui Sea.

00:38:14.320 --> 00:38:16.820
He told me honestly that he was from Zhushui Spiritual State

00:38:17.230 --> 00:38:19.690
and that he came to Jixing Abyss for the Golden Millet Dream.

00:38:20.480 --> 00:38:21.460
Moreover...

Zhushui Spiritual State has a backup plan.

00:38:28.280 --> 00:38:29.010
How do you know that?

00:38:32.110 --> 00:38:33.780
No wonder he went to the Sunken Abyss that day

00:38:34.030 --> 00:38:35.170
without waiting for us.

00:38:35.920 --> 00:38:38.380
He even gave Master She the Bo's Medical Classics he found.

00:38:38.880 --> 00:38:40.530
That was when Master and I started feeling suspicious.

00:38:42.190 --> 00:38:43.090
In that case,

00:38:43.110 --> 00:38:44.170
he is still a dangerous person.

00:38:52.400 --> 00:38:53.130
You're back.

00:38:53.590 --> 00:38:54.340
Father.

00:38:54.920 --> 00:38:57.530
I've found the complete formula for the Golden Millet Dream

00:38:58.030 --> 00:38:59.170
and all the herbs required.

00:39:00.070 --> 00:39:01.940
However, the catalyst herb, Diwu tree's core,

00:39:02.880 --> 00:39:04.050
has been extinct for 10,000 years.

00:39:04.590 --> 00:39:06.740
I don't know where to find it.

00:39:08.190 --> 00:39:09.820
Please aid me, Father.

00:39:11.550 --> 00:39:13.530
Do you think I will have something

00:39:14.280 --> 00:39:16.010
that has been extinct for 10,000 years?

00:39:17.510 --> 00:39:19.300
If it cannot be found in Zhushui Spiritual State,

00:39:20.360 --> 00:39:21.460
then there's no need

00:39:21.460 --> 00:39:21.940
[Bo's Medical Classics]

00:39:22.510 --> 00:39:24.460
for this formula to remain in this world.

00:39:35.150 --> 00:39:36.170
Father,

00:39:36.710 --> 00:39:39.300
I'm the only one who has read the whole book.

00:39:40.590 --> 00:39:41.650
I remember

00:39:42.510 --> 00:39:44.050
every word in it

00:39:44.280 --> 00:39:46.460
and can copy it down any time.

00:39:47.320 --> 00:39:49.090
Once I make this medicine,

00:39:49.630 --> 00:39:51.820
I'll surely hand it over to you, Father.

00:40:08.070 --> 00:40:08.860
Chao Yuan,

00:40:09.880 --> 00:40:12.980
you've achieved this mastery with the Thousand Insect Spell.

00:40:13.880 --> 00:40:14.980
You are also braver

00:40:15.320 --> 00:40:16.740
than you were in the past.

00:40:17.710 --> 00:40:20.260
You actually dare negotiate with me.

00:40:20.630 --> 00:40:21.610
Great.

00:40:22.230 --> 00:40:24.050
I like it a lot.

00:40:27.190 --> 00:40:29.300
You've laid low for many years.

00:40:30.320 --> 00:40:31.090
Tell me

00:40:31.400 --> 00:40:33.130
what your ambition is.

00:40:37.110 --> 00:40:38.650
I want to grow my own spiritual veins

00:40:39.400 --> 00:40:40.820
and become the ruler of Zhushui Spiritual State

00:40:40.840 --> 00:40:42.570
that everyone admires.

00:40:43.630 --> 00:40:46.090
I want to become the heir whom you recognize.

00:40:48.440 --> 00:40:50.650
I want you to tell me everything.

00:40:51.400 --> 00:40:52.900
Under your arrangement,

00:40:54.030 --> 00:40:56.570
what will become of Zhushui Spiritual State

00:40:57.110 --> 00:40:58.980
and the Qingyun Tournament?

00:41:05.000 --> 00:41:05.900
I want

00:41:07.440 --> 00:41:08.820
to overcome destiny itself.

00:41:16.190 --> 00:41:17.650
Among my sons,

00:41:18.280 --> 00:41:19.690
you resemble me the most.

00:41:23.280 --> 00:41:26.130
Two years ago, Jixing Abyss lost in the tournament

00:41:26.630 --> 00:41:30.050
and had to offer a tribute to Yaoguang Mountain and our realm.

00:41:30.710 --> 00:41:32.260
The rarest of the tributes

00:41:32.760 --> 00:41:35.530
were two wilted roots of Diwu tree.

00:41:36.360 --> 00:41:38.300
The one offered to Yaoguang Mountain

00:41:38.400 --> 00:41:39.740
was stolen by Bo Yulan.

00:41:39.880 --> 00:41:40.610
That was why

00:41:41.070 --> 00:41:43.690
Bo Yulan was caught by Mu Qibai.

00:41:44.400 --> 00:41:45.980
The remaining one

00:41:46.760 --> 00:41:48.340
was sent to this realm.

00:41:52.190 --> 00:41:53.690
It's up to you now

00:41:53.920 --> 00:41:55.530
to nurture it back to health.

00:42:03.280 --> 00:42:04.260
Thank you, Father.

00:42:12.670 --> 00:42:13.460
Come out.

00:42:17.710 --> 00:42:20.570
Your Majesty, congratulations on soon obtaining theGolden Millet Dream.

00:42:20.760 --> 00:42:22.380
You may rule over the Six Realms.

00:42:23.360 --> 00:42:24.980
There's no need to flatter me.

00:42:25.550 --> 00:42:26.860
I summoned you here

00:42:27.000 --> 00:42:28.380
