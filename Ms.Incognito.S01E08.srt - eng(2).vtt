01:01:44.705 --> 01:01:46.338
Snap out of it, friend!

01:01:46.338 --> 01:01:47.705
Can you see me?

01:01:47.705 --> 01:01:49.605
Yeong Ran, are you hurt?

01:01:49.605 --> 01:01:51.238
Hye Ji.

01:02:00.272 --> 01:02:01.305
Baek Hye Ji.

01:02:01.305 --> 01:02:02.905
No.

01:02:46.138 --> 01:02:47.672
Goodbye.

01:02:47.672 --> 01:02:49.872
Ms. Bu Se Mi.

01:03:11.538 --> 01:03:17.172
♫ Starting to be born again ♫

01:03:29.772 --> 01:03:32.772
♫ Now is the time ♫

01:03:32.772 --> 01:03:40.872
♫ Even hidden scars will shine ♫

01:03:40.872 --> 01:03:43.938
♫ I share the light ♫

01:03:43.938 --> 01:03:50.405
♫ I'll brighten the days shrouded in darkness ♫

01:03:50.405 --> 01:03:52.038
This was Gil Ho Se's room.

01:03:52.038 --> 01:03:53.872
There must be something here.

01:03:53.872 --> 01:03:55.805
Lee Mi Seon, principal of Iseon Kindergarten.

01:03:55.805 --> 01:03:57.138
Let's not involve family.

01:03:57.138 --> 01:03:58.738
Let me make a proposal.

01:03:58.738 --> 01:04:00.238
Doctor!

01:04:00.238 --> 01:04:02.572
In exchange for that proposal,
how much will you give me?

01:04:02.572 --> 01:04:04.205
As much as you want.

01:04:04.205 --> 01:04:06.172
You miss Ms. Bu Se Mi a lot, right?

01:04:06.172 --> 01:04:07.905
I have something to say.

01:04:07.905 --> 01:04:08.972
I've missed you.

01:04:08.972 --> 01:04:10.638
Huh? What?

01:04:10.638 --> 01:04:12.738
Even if everything fails,

01:04:12.738 --> 01:04:15.038
I'll kill Ga Seon Yeong myself then.

01:04:15.038 --> 01:04:18.438
