WEBVTT

00:00:03.003 --> 00:00:06.940
Year 2002

00:00:08.875 --> 00:00:09.876
Kota.

00:00:12.445 --> 00:00:13.446
Kota.

00:00:15.648 --> 00:00:16.649
Stop it already.

00:00:17.684 --> 00:00:18.852
What are you talking about?

00:00:19.986 --> 00:00:21.054
The petition and stuff.

00:00:22.956 --> 00:00:23.957
Why?

00:00:24.657 --> 00:00:26.292
My friend told me...

00:00:29.129 --> 00:00:32.632
"Your brother's
been acting strange lately."

00:00:39.339 --> 00:00:42.776
I feel bad that you have to
go through this because of me.

00:00:48.214 --> 00:00:49.215
But still...

00:00:51.484 --> 00:00:52.752
If I don't do it...

00:00:55.288 --> 00:00:56.856
I won't be myself anymore.

00:01:00.693 --> 00:01:01.694
What's up?

00:01:01.761 --> 00:01:03.163
Takashi, you're here?

00:01:04.064 --> 00:01:06.332
Well... Yeah.

00:01:07.534 --> 00:01:09.269
What, did I come in
at an awkward time?

00:01:09.602 --> 00:01:11.771
Wait, is it time for
the lunch broadcast?

00:01:12.572 --> 00:01:16.209
This is the list of songs
I made to play during lunch break.

00:01:16.309 --> 00:01:18.078
– Have a listen.
– Okay.

00:01:18.478 --> 00:01:20.046
– Sounds good.
– Right?

00:01:20.647 --> 00:01:22.449
– Yeah.
– What about the order?

00:01:38.198 --> 00:01:39.699
Print

00:01:43.236 --> 00:01:45.772
I am the one who brings down
the Kusanagi sword

00:01:45.872 --> 00:01:48.041
upon those who enter through the
Hirakawa Gate.

00:01:52.345 --> 00:01:54.180
Your injustice will soon be exposed
to the light of day.

00:01:54.247 --> 00:01:55.315
Signed, Prince Yamato Takeru

00:02:14.634 --> 00:02:17.070
Excuse me. If you're here
for a visitation, it's up ahead.

00:02:20.773 --> 00:02:24.210
No, I'm not.

00:02:29.816 --> 00:02:31.351
Number 86.

00:02:33.019 --> 00:02:34.020
Yes.

00:02:34.821 --> 00:02:36.456
She's not accepting visitors today.

00:02:37.323 --> 00:02:38.925
Please return the visitation slip.

00:02:39.025 --> 00:02:40.059
I'm against it.

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:41.161
What? Why?

00:02:41.261 --> 00:02:42.862
A financial product?
It doesn't make sense!

00:02:42.962 --> 00:02:44.030
Wait a second.

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:46.166
What are you guys arguing about?

00:02:46.266 --> 00:02:47.300
Well, it's just...

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:49.435
Here. It's about this.

00:02:49.502 --> 00:02:50.737
Business Project Competition
for High School Students

00:02:52.105 --> 00:02:54.474
Right, I see.

00:02:55.208 --> 00:02:56.543
You're entering the
Kaho Foundation BizCon?

00:02:56.643 --> 00:02:57.644
Yes.

00:02:57.744 --> 00:03:00.113
It's the biggest business contest
for high school students, right?

00:03:00.213 --> 00:03:03.550
That's right. We're aiming
for the finals this time.

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:05.685
But then, Fuyuki suddenly
started saying weird stuff.

00:03:05.785 --> 00:03:07.387
He suddenly suggested doing
a financial product.

00:03:07.487 --> 00:03:08.755
We're entering to get exempted

00:03:08.821 --> 00:03:10.456
from the first round of
the AO entrance exam, right?

00:03:10.723 --> 00:03:12.392
There's no point
if we don't take risks!

00:03:12.458 --> 00:03:14.360
Sorry, but that idea won't win.

00:03:14.627 --> 00:03:15.695
Stay out of it.

00:03:15.795 --> 00:03:19.465
I'd like to hear why you think so.
Mr. Mikami, what is your reasoning?

00:03:19.566 --> 00:03:22.368
Didn't you think it was strange
when you looked at past winners?

00:03:23.703 --> 00:03:25.505
Yeah, there's a clear bias.

00:03:25.738 --> 00:03:27.840
Is there perhaps favoritism
by the adults?

00:03:27.941 --> 00:03:29.576
The Kaho Foundation
and the government...

00:03:29.676 --> 00:03:31.110
Well, maybe you don't know.

00:03:31.211 --> 00:03:33.446
I heard they're
practically glued at the hip.

00:03:34.247 --> 00:03:37.016
Still, a miracle could happen
if you happen to come up with

00:03:37.116 --> 00:03:38.218
something undeniably good.

00:03:38.318 --> 00:03:40.453
Of course. That's the whole plan.

00:03:42.522 --> 00:03:43.690
What's your idea, Fuyuki?

00:03:44.524 --> 00:03:45.558
This is my plan.

00:03:47.227 --> 00:03:49.729
"A principal-protected fund
that lets high schoolers

00:03:49.829 --> 00:03:51.598
learn to invest safely."

00:03:52.232 --> 00:03:53.366
And you, Miyazawa?

00:03:53.733 --> 00:03:55.668
I want to propose
a product development plan

00:03:55.768 --> 00:03:57.770
with social contribution in mind.

00:03:58.371 --> 00:03:59.472
Specifically?

00:03:59.572 --> 00:04:02.709
Over summer break, I went on tours
of waste disposal companies

00:04:02.875 --> 00:04:06.679
that focus on SDGs and companies that
make custom shoes for the elderly.

00:04:07.046 --> 00:04:08.715
But I couldn't come up
with any good ideas.

00:04:09.382 --> 00:04:10.483
I see.

00:04:11.784 --> 00:04:13.753
So, Fuyuki wants to

00:04:13.820 --> 00:04:15.555
make financial products
for high schoolers.

00:04:15.655 --> 00:04:19.626
And you, Miyazawa, want to develop
products useful to society.

00:04:21.561 --> 00:04:22.795
What do you think, Wakui?

00:04:24.797 --> 00:04:26.366
They're both about the same.

00:04:26.532 --> 00:04:29.569
Wait, what?
Why do you say that, Wakui?

00:04:30.036 --> 00:04:31.838
Please explain your reasoning.

00:04:32.639 --> 00:04:34.307
First, about Fuyuki's idea.

00:04:34.407 --> 00:04:36.876
"Principal-protected"
just isn't realistic.

00:04:37.310 --> 00:04:40.380
What? But didn't Fuyuki just say

00:04:40.480 --> 00:04:42.282
it's the most popular
financial product now?

00:04:42.382 --> 00:04:45.184
That's a financial product based on
investing in

00:04:45.251 --> 00:04:47.720
high-risk, high-return
overseas hedge funds.

00:04:47.820 --> 00:04:50.523
Well, of course, the investment ratio
would need to be adjusted.

00:04:50.623 --> 00:04:52.492
Did you actually
read the fund description?

00:04:52.592 --> 00:04:55.228
This isn't something amateurs
like high schoolers can handle.

00:04:56.329 --> 00:04:57.697
Mr. Wakui, sir.

00:04:58.531 --> 00:05:00.967
I couldn't understand
almost anything you just said!

00:05:01.701 --> 00:05:03.236
Plus, you've got a guy
like that on your team.

00:05:03.336 --> 00:05:04.337
I'm sorry.

00:05:04.604 --> 00:05:06.539
See? I told you it's not feasible.

00:05:06.639 --> 00:05:07.840
It's a business contest
for high schoolers

00:05:07.940 --> 00:05:10.243
so product development that
helps society is the safest bet.

00:05:10.343 --> 00:05:12.645
But you don't have
anything solid yet

00:05:12.745 --> 00:05:14.514
so that's a non-starter,
isn't it, Miyazawa?

00:05:15.882 --> 00:05:18.551
Excuse me. Are we not having class?

00:05:18.651 --> 00:05:20.887
I'm sorry. Let's get started.

00:05:21.654 --> 00:05:22.722
Okay, take your seats.

00:05:23.589 --> 00:05:24.590
Yes.

00:05:25.858 --> 00:05:29.896
Today, we are starting from
page 193.

00:05:37.437 --> 00:05:41.007
MR. MIKAMI'S CLASSROOM

00:05:41.374 --> 00:05:44.844
Hey. So about earlier...

00:05:45.078 --> 00:05:48.081
– Can't you combine the two?
– What do you mean by combine?

00:05:48.314 --> 00:05:50.650
– Social contribution and finance.
– That's impossible.

00:05:50.850 --> 00:05:53.486
You're always so quick to deny ideas.
You're so rigid, Miyazawa.

00:05:53.586 --> 00:05:56.322
So, you guys want me to help you out?

00:05:56.923 --> 00:05:59.058
You really stick your nose
into everything, don't you?

00:05:59.158 --> 00:06:01.794
No, Tominaga's energy is
actually a huge asset!

00:06:01.961 --> 00:06:03.329
Please help us.

00:06:03.429 --> 00:06:05.531
Leave it to me!
So, what should I do?

00:06:09.869 --> 00:06:12.105
Shiiba, let's eat lunch
on the rooftop.

00:06:13.339 --> 00:06:14.340
Yeah.

00:06:14.774 --> 00:06:15.908
Okay, let's go.

00:06:17.310 --> 00:06:21.180
Shiiba from your class has been
feeling unwell since spring.

00:06:21.647 --> 00:06:23.483
But she still
comes to school every day.

00:06:23.683 --> 00:06:26.819
It's her period.
It seems to be hitting her hard.

00:06:27.487 --> 00:06:29.122
Her period?

00:06:29.222 --> 00:06:31.691
Yes, it's been ongoing for a while.

00:06:31.758 --> 00:06:33.459
I thought I should let you know.

00:06:34.327 --> 00:06:35.928
Got it. Thank you.

00:06:36.629 --> 00:06:38.164
Please watch over her.

00:06:41.634 --> 00:06:42.902
What about Yuzuru?

00:06:43.736 --> 00:06:47.640
I went to the detention center
a few times over summer break.

00:06:49.442 --> 00:06:51.043
But I couldn't see her.

00:06:52.378 --> 00:06:53.379
I see.

00:06:55.882 --> 00:06:58.651
I've sent her letters.

00:07:01.587 --> 00:07:03.689
I hope she writes back.

00:07:07.760 --> 00:07:08.761
I hope so too.

00:07:15.234 --> 00:07:16.369
I'm home.

00:07:18.604 --> 00:07:19.605
Takuto.

00:07:23.576 --> 00:07:25.378
This letter came for you.

00:07:25.645 --> 00:07:27.647
From Mayama Yuzuru

00:07:30.983 --> 00:07:33.219
You'd be better off
not telling your father.

00:07:35.922 --> 00:07:36.923
Thanks.

00:07:57.743 --> 00:07:59.645
I heard about the school festival.

00:08:00.046 --> 00:08:03.816
When the question on the necessity of
textbook screening appeared

00:08:03.916 --> 00:08:06.552
I thought to myself,
"This is the end of Makino Kyosuke."

00:08:07.019 --> 00:08:08.521
Was it really that bad?

00:08:08.988 --> 00:08:11.924
If we're going to
get scolded from Nagatacho

00:08:12.158 --> 00:08:13.593
it's usually over stuff like that.

00:08:13.926 --> 00:08:16.195
I heard it was
the students acting rashly.

00:08:16.295 --> 00:08:17.530
That's right.

00:08:19.866 --> 00:08:20.867
However...

00:08:21.501 --> 00:08:23.269
I found this.

00:08:25.271 --> 00:08:27.206
At this part where they're to
rearrange the exhibits

00:08:27.473 --> 00:08:29.475
it says, "Plan Okami."

00:08:30.309 --> 00:08:33.546
In other words,
it was Mikami's idea, right?

00:08:34.280 --> 00:08:36.749
This seems like it might
come in handy in a pinch.

00:08:37.850 --> 00:08:38.985
It does, doesn't it?

00:08:40.820 --> 00:08:43.022
This is future hypothetical tense.
Right here.

00:08:43.122 --> 00:08:45.691
Right, I think I've seen that before.

00:08:46.192 --> 00:08:50.196
For stuff like this,
it's faster to just think in English.

00:08:51.597 --> 00:08:53.132
Okay, I got it.

00:08:55.268 --> 00:08:57.236
– Excuse me.
– Mr. Mikami.

00:08:57.837 --> 00:08:59.238
Isn't that student...

00:09:00.006 --> 00:09:03.643
He's a freshman, but he hasn't
been able to attend school.

00:09:04.343 --> 00:09:06.579
But, he said he could come
if it's to the director's office

00:09:06.679 --> 00:09:08.014
so we're letting him
attend from there.

00:09:08.114 --> 00:09:09.282
Really?

00:09:10.049 --> 00:09:11.951
Even students
who come to schools like ours

00:09:12.018 --> 00:09:13.886
can experience things like this.

00:09:14.186 --> 00:09:17.523
Education isn't
always straightforward.

00:09:20.226 --> 00:09:22.094
Please, right this way. Sorry.

00:09:23.229 --> 00:09:25.598
So, what's this about?

00:09:25.698 --> 00:09:27.400
Right.

00:09:27.466 --> 00:09:30.570
It's about the Kaho Foundation
Business Competition.

00:09:31.671 --> 00:09:34.574
Winning that competition has been
a long-standing goal of this school.

00:09:35.775 --> 00:09:39.378
So I hope our students
can really give it their all.

00:09:40.246 --> 00:09:43.849
However, for the theme...

00:09:44.717 --> 00:09:47.420
I'd like you to
guide them well on that.

00:09:47.620 --> 00:09:48.621
The theme?

00:09:49.422 --> 00:09:53.326
Given the school festival incident,
if it's too provocative...

00:09:53.926 --> 00:09:56.362
We might get
another scolding from Kasumigaseki.

00:09:58.564 --> 00:10:01.200
One of the competition judges

00:10:01.267 --> 00:10:05.404
is from a think tank
under the Cabinet Office.

00:10:06.138 --> 00:10:07.173
So, depending on the content

00:10:07.239 --> 00:10:09.375
we could even
get a warning from Nagatacho.

00:10:10.610 --> 00:10:14.347
Of course, we value
student autonomy. But still...

00:10:16.482 --> 00:10:18.584
Understood. I'll be careful.

00:10:19.051 --> 00:10:20.319
Thank you.

00:10:22.154 --> 00:10:24.790
– That's all for today's class.
– Thank you.

00:10:25.024 --> 00:10:27.593
Ms. Koreeda, do you invest?

00:10:27.693 --> 00:10:29.161
What's this? That's random.

00:10:29.261 --> 00:10:31.230
Team Miyazawa is entering the BizCon.

00:10:31.330 --> 00:10:34.734
Yes, I heard. Are they submitting
a finance-related plan?

00:10:34.834 --> 00:10:37.570
Yes. It's a plan to connect

00:10:37.637 --> 00:10:39.271
financial products
with social contribution.

00:10:39.372 --> 00:10:43.576
It's easy to think of ways to
use profit for social contribution.

00:10:43.676 --> 00:10:45.478
But we're drawing blanks
coming up with ideas

00:10:45.544 --> 00:10:47.179
to profit through
social contribution.

00:10:47.246 --> 00:10:48.914
Got any ideas?

00:10:50.516 --> 00:10:51.517
Listen.

00:10:51.584 --> 00:10:54.887
Do I look like
the type of person who invests?

00:10:55.321 --> 00:10:56.789
Then what about
your retirement savings?

00:10:57.723 --> 00:10:59.659
Safe and steady
with a fixed deposit account.

00:10:59.759 --> 00:11:02.061
Nope, totally useless.

00:11:02.161 --> 00:11:04.063
This is a great chance.
Ms. Koreeda, hear us out.

00:11:04.163 --> 00:11:05.164
Here goes.

00:11:07.033 --> 00:11:09.869
Let's say you deposit
one million yen in a bank.

00:11:09.969 --> 00:11:11.604
How long would it take to double?

00:11:12.138 --> 00:11:14.173
What? I have no idea.

00:11:14.707 --> 00:11:16.709
There's something called
the Rule of 72.

00:11:16.809 --> 00:11:18.744
– The Rule of 72?
– Yes.

00:11:18.878 --> 00:11:21.380
The Rule of 72...

00:11:23.516 --> 00:11:26.152
Even at banks offering
high fixed-deposit interest rates

00:11:26.252 --> 00:11:28.287
the annual interest is around 0.5%.

00:11:28.354 --> 00:11:29.422
What does that mean?

00:11:29.822 --> 00:11:32.625
To calculate how many years
it takes to double the principal

00:11:32.725 --> 00:11:36.295
you divide 72 by the interest rate.

00:11:36.395 --> 00:11:43.402
So if you divide 72 by 0.5,
it would take 144 years.

00:11:43.536 --> 00:11:44.837
What? Seriously?

00:11:45.304 --> 00:11:47.373
What's worse, major banks
have an annual interest rate

00:11:47.440 --> 00:11:52.912
– of 0.125%.
– That would be 576 years.

00:11:53.012 --> 00:11:54.880
Wow, I'll never retire.

00:11:55.614 --> 00:11:56.849
When did Mr. Mikami show up?

00:11:57.149 --> 00:11:58.350
Is this about
the business competition?

00:11:58.918 --> 00:12:01.821
Got any miraculous ideas,
Ms. Koreeda?

00:12:02.088 --> 00:12:03.556
Cut me some slack here.

00:12:03.856 --> 00:12:06.826
Anything finance-related
is out of the question for me.

00:12:06.926 --> 00:12:09.562
Your family seems pretty good
at making money, though.

00:12:10.629 --> 00:12:12.198
Which is exactly why
I'm allergic to it.

00:12:13.099 --> 00:12:14.600
– That.
– What?

00:12:14.900 --> 00:12:17.570
I'd like to hear
why you're allergic to money.

00:12:17.670 --> 00:12:18.804
As would I.

00:12:19.205 --> 00:12:21.373
I don't think I'll be much help.

00:12:21.474 --> 00:12:23.609
People who think so
are usually the most helpful.

00:12:23.709 --> 00:12:26.078
– That's harsh.
– Can we talk?

00:12:26.579 --> 00:12:28.114
Of course, go ahead.

00:12:29.815 --> 00:12:30.816
Not here, though.

00:12:30.983 --> 00:12:33.519
Well, we need a plan that

00:12:33.586 --> 00:12:35.488
appeals even to people
who are reluctant about investing.

00:12:41.360 --> 00:12:43.629
She said she'd meet me
if it's with you, Okami.

00:12:46.766 --> 00:12:48.734
Aren't visits only allowed
on weekdays?

00:12:50.269 --> 00:12:51.771
We have a day off next week

00:12:51.871 --> 00:12:53.839
for the anniversary of
the school's founding.

00:12:54.440 --> 00:12:55.474
Right, I see.

00:13:01.847 --> 00:13:03.682
I really don't want to
bow my head to you...

00:13:08.187 --> 00:13:09.722
but I absolutely have to meet her.

00:13:15.261 --> 00:13:16.262
Got it.

00:13:23.369 --> 00:13:24.804
Thank you for your help.

00:13:35.581 --> 00:13:39.418
To the person accompanying
visitor number 16 on the 2nd floor

00:13:39.518 --> 00:13:41.821
please proceed to the 2nd floor.

00:14:11.483 --> 00:14:15.588
Hey, is this boy Kanzaki?

00:14:19.959 --> 00:14:20.960
Yes.

00:14:24.363 --> 00:14:26.398
You've got three seconds.

00:14:26.899 --> 00:14:29.201
Then never get involved
in my life again.

00:14:29.602 --> 00:14:31.470
Why didn't you kill me?

00:14:33.806 --> 00:14:34.807
What?

00:14:36.909 --> 00:14:38.844
I'm the one
who destroyed your family.

00:14:38.911 --> 00:14:40.045
Not him.

00:14:42.414 --> 00:14:43.883
I simply didn't know.

00:14:46.285 --> 00:14:47.286
What?

00:14:48.721 --> 00:14:50.923
I didn't know anything
about your newspaper article

00:14:50.990 --> 00:14:53.659
until I got your letter.

00:14:56.228 --> 00:15:02.301
Ms. Saejima never told you
about this news article.

00:15:02.401 --> 00:15:04.837
Affair Between
Saejima and Tsutsui Exposed!

00:15:05.504 --> 00:15:06.505
Right?

00:15:08.240 --> 00:15:09.842
Why a guy like him?

00:15:11.176 --> 00:15:13.412
– I'm sorry...
– Get out!

00:15:13.946 --> 00:15:16.482
Please let me talk to Yuzuru.

00:15:16.916 --> 00:15:18.150
There's nothing to talk about!

00:15:18.250 --> 00:15:21.086
Let me talk to Yuzuru!

00:15:22.021 --> 00:15:24.223
If I wasn't the reason
you did what you did

00:15:25.324 --> 00:15:29.161
then was it
revenge against your father?

00:15:35.200 --> 00:15:36.402
Why would I do that?

00:15:41.040 --> 00:15:42.441
That was my reason.

00:15:45.477 --> 00:15:46.512
What?

00:15:48.847 --> 00:15:51.116
I exposed Ms. Saejima's scandal

00:15:51.417 --> 00:15:53.686
to get back at my journalist father.

00:15:56.522 --> 00:15:57.523
So?

00:15:58.657 --> 00:16:01.460
I said your pathetic newspaper
had nothing to do with this!

00:16:02.594 --> 00:16:04.029
It must have been tough.

00:16:05.230 --> 00:16:06.231
What?

00:16:06.732 --> 00:16:09.468
Being betrayed by your mother,
the one person you believed in.

00:16:09.868 --> 00:16:11.670
Then you were left alone
in a house without her

00:16:11.770 --> 00:16:13.706
constantly being berated
by your father.

00:16:15.307 --> 00:16:16.542
Shut up.

00:16:17.643 --> 00:16:21.280
Considering his character,
there might've been violence too.

00:16:21.380 --> 00:16:23.949
– So what?
– There's no way it wasn't painful.

00:16:27.119 --> 00:16:28.721
You're seriously annoying! Shut up.

00:16:37.029 --> 00:16:39.164
Ms. Shibutani Kanako.

00:16:40.032 --> 00:16:41.100
Do you know her?

00:16:46.705 --> 00:16:47.740
I met with her.

00:16:51.810 --> 00:16:53.379
You met with Shibutani Kanako?

00:16:58.017 --> 00:16:59.518
She asked me to tell you this.

00:17:02.287 --> 00:17:03.856
I don't need to hear it!

00:17:08.160 --> 00:17:11.997
"If you asked me who I hate
the most right now,

00:17:12.865 --> 00:17:17.503
it would be you, Mayama Yuzuru,
without a doubt.

00:17:19.038 --> 00:17:20.539
As I sit in my son's empty room

00:17:21.240 --> 00:17:23.242
all I do is pray
you'll receive the death penalty.

00:17:23.809 --> 00:17:25.577
I'm alive, but it's like
I'm already dead.

00:17:26.645 --> 00:17:32.051
That's why I thought
I had nothing to say to you.

00:17:33.819 --> 00:17:36.221
I wished you would disappear.

00:17:38.991 --> 00:17:44.263
But when Kanzaki asked
if I had anything to say...

00:17:46.198 --> 00:17:49.768
I realized there was
something I had to tell you.

00:17:54.907 --> 00:17:56.508
Through the newspapers and television

00:17:57.910 --> 00:18:00.312
when I learned about
the life you had led

00:18:02.114 --> 00:18:06.385
I began to understand
why you did what you did.

00:18:07.486 --> 00:18:09.455
I felt like I finally understood."

00:18:12.758 --> 00:18:16.361
This is for good luck.
I hope you pass.

00:18:17.996 --> 00:18:20.099
Thanks, Mom.
Well, I'm off.

00:18:20.199 --> 00:18:21.366
Because where you were...

00:18:21.467 --> 00:18:22.501
Good luck!

00:18:22.868 --> 00:18:28.907
It was so much like the place
Yusuke and I had escaped from.

00:18:32.177 --> 00:18:33.178
Stop...

00:18:37.850 --> 00:18:38.884
"Yuzuru.

00:18:41.086 --> 00:18:43.021
On the back of
the person you killed

00:18:44.156 --> 00:18:47.893
was a burn mark from the cigarette
his father put out on him.

00:18:56.101 --> 00:19:00.472
I felt I really needed to
tell you this.

00:19:04.309 --> 00:19:06.178
And while writing this letter

00:19:07.312 --> 00:19:12.684
I can't help but wonder
why you ended up that way.

00:19:15.354 --> 00:19:16.622
I don't want to think about it.

00:19:18.323 --> 00:19:20.459
But I just can't stop thinking."

00:19:20.559 --> 00:19:22.561
What are you, deaf?
I said stop!

00:19:22.661 --> 00:19:23.662
"And perhaps...

00:19:25.864 --> 00:19:28.567
I won't stop thinking
about it. Until forever.

00:19:30.802 --> 00:19:32.104
Signed, Shibutani Kanako."

00:19:39.778 --> 00:19:41.280
She's thinking.

00:19:45.551 --> 00:19:46.919
She keeps thinking.

00:19:50.923 --> 00:19:51.924
That's why...

00:19:54.459 --> 00:19:56.595
There's no way
we can justify giving up.

00:20:05.671 --> 00:20:07.172
Who the hell do you think you are?

00:20:09.308 --> 00:20:10.375
You're just a damn kid!

00:20:14.680 --> 00:20:15.814
I'm not anybody.

00:20:20.819 --> 00:20:24.189
You, me, we're both guilty!

00:20:38.537 --> 00:20:39.838
In this one movie...

00:20:41.640 --> 00:20:44.509
There was a luxury hotel that's
taken over by teenage terrorists

00:20:45.244 --> 00:20:47.145
and the guests were killed,
one after another.

00:20:49.615 --> 00:20:51.383
But during the massacre...

00:20:53.385 --> 00:20:54.953
one of the teenage terrorists

00:20:56.755 --> 00:20:58.890
ate some of
the guests' leftover pizza.

00:21:01.593 --> 00:21:05.264
It was likely his first pizza ever.

00:21:09.101 --> 00:21:12.904
It was so delicious,
he laughed innocently.

00:21:15.707 --> 00:21:18.076
Right in front of the bodies
of those he had just killed.

00:21:21.146 --> 00:21:22.581
The truly evil people

00:21:24.316 --> 00:21:25.884
weren't the ones in that hotel.

00:21:28.520 --> 00:21:29.721
No, what was there...

00:21:31.823 --> 00:21:34.693
was just a poor boy
who had never eaten pizza before.

00:21:36.094 --> 00:21:38.930
And the tourists
who happened to be there

00:21:39.031 --> 00:21:40.966
just happened to have
a little more money than others.

00:21:42.734 --> 00:21:44.336
Are you trying to say that

00:21:46.438 --> 00:21:48.507
the truly evil ones aren't here?

00:22:00.185 --> 00:22:01.186
But...

00:22:05.957 --> 00:22:08.026
If I don't take responsibility...

00:22:11.797 --> 00:22:13.031
I can't move forward.

00:22:16.601 --> 00:22:17.669
I can't...

00:22:22.541 --> 00:22:23.742
And neither can you, Yuzuru.

00:22:34.052 --> 00:22:35.120
Yuzuru.

00:22:38.490 --> 00:22:42.594
Do you really think
Ms. Saejima was having an affair?

00:22:52.170 --> 00:22:53.538
I believe in her.

00:22:59.644 --> 00:23:01.113
The Ms. Saejima I know...

00:23:06.251 --> 00:23:07.819
would never do something like that.

00:25:00.465 --> 00:25:03.568
There's no clear
disadvantages we can identify.

00:25:04.970 --> 00:25:07.072
This is bad, we still haven't
submitted the documents.

00:25:07.472 --> 00:25:09.174
We've already written
a practical flow

00:25:09.241 --> 00:25:10.709
that could actually work.

00:25:10.942 --> 00:25:13.345
No, this won't do.
At this rate, we'll fail on paper.

00:25:13.445 --> 00:25:14.779
Three Weeks Before BizCon

00:25:14.880 --> 00:25:16.047
Hey, Kurayoshi.

00:25:16.114 --> 00:25:18.350
You were studying
investment in America, right?

00:25:18.517 --> 00:25:19.851
Got any good ideas?

00:25:19.951 --> 00:25:23.655
They made us start from the basics,
but what I learned there

00:25:23.755 --> 00:25:26.424
was basically stuff like
"Let's do proper research," you know.

00:25:26.525 --> 00:25:28.860
I see.

00:25:29.294 --> 00:25:34.633
Still, I think the proposal
you're trying to create is excellent.

00:25:34.733 --> 00:25:36.568
Really? What exactly is
good about it?

00:25:36.635 --> 00:25:37.669
Please tell us.

00:25:38.737 --> 00:25:40.205
For example, in Europe and America

00:25:40.272 --> 00:25:42.674
if companies that
invest in forest protection

00:25:42.741 --> 00:25:45.176
also make products
that cause air pollution

00:25:45.243 --> 00:25:47.212
that contradiction
gets them rejected.

00:25:47.646 --> 00:25:48.847
But with this...

00:25:48.947 --> 00:25:51.850
You want to generate profit
while contributing to society, right?

00:25:51.950 --> 00:25:52.951
Yes.

00:25:53.051 --> 00:25:54.419
I think that's a really sound idea.

00:25:56.488 --> 00:25:59.691
So, what should we do to win?

00:26:00.225 --> 00:26:03.628
Maybe you should try borrowing
everyone's wisdom?

00:26:03.828 --> 00:26:04.829
What?

00:26:04.930 --> 00:26:06.631
Since you brought it up,
Ms. Koreeda...

00:26:06.731 --> 00:26:08.333
Why don't you facilitate
this discussion?

00:26:09.401 --> 00:26:10.602
I'd love to give it a try.

00:26:12.037 --> 00:26:13.038
May I?

00:26:18.043 --> 00:26:21.913
I realized something while talking
with you guys the other day.

00:26:33.224 --> 00:26:36.828
We're the ones
turning this into money.

00:26:37.963 --> 00:26:40.665
I mean, this is just
a piece of paper, right?

00:26:42.233 --> 00:26:45.503
The reason we can
buy things with paper

00:26:45.770 --> 00:26:48.640
is because we believe in the promise

00:26:48.707 --> 00:26:51.076
that it will continue
to be usable as money.

00:26:54.613 --> 00:27:00.552
Until now, I had always thought
money was something dirty.

00:27:01.953 --> 00:27:02.954
But...

00:27:03.989 --> 00:27:07.225
When I realized it's actually
a manifestation of trust

00:27:07.859 --> 00:27:12.163
I felt like, "Wow, money and
humans are both amazing."

00:27:18.870 --> 00:27:21.373
What is it that
the BizCon team wants to do now?

00:27:22.540 --> 00:27:23.642
Fuyuki.

00:27:24.109 --> 00:27:25.243
What? Me?

00:27:25.810 --> 00:27:28.146
You're the one who
started this idea, yes?

00:27:33.385 --> 00:27:34.886
Everyone wants to know, right?

00:28:02.681 --> 00:28:07.152
My father worked at
a foreign investment bank.

00:28:07.786 --> 00:28:10.021
He was right in the middle
of the money game.

00:28:13.758 --> 00:28:15.093
Why the past tense?

00:28:17.729 --> 00:28:20.131
You've heard of
the Lehman Shock, right?

00:28:21.433 --> 00:28:22.434
Yeah.

00:28:22.534 --> 00:28:24.436
Well, after suffering
a huge loss from that...

00:28:26.771 --> 00:28:29.174
the entire Japan branch
ceased to exist.

00:28:33.344 --> 00:28:35.847
Can you tell us
what the Lehman Shock was?

00:28:48.193 --> 00:28:51.863
In the early 2000s, there was
a housing boom in the US.

00:28:53.231 --> 00:28:55.767
People who can't normally
buy a house are called "subprime."

00:28:56.701 --> 00:28:59.370
It refers to people with
low creditworthiness.

00:28:59.871 --> 00:29:03.274
So, even those low-income individuals
could take out a mortgage

00:29:03.374 --> 00:29:06.044
if they were willing to pay
higher interest rates than normal.

00:29:07.011 --> 00:29:09.414
That's what subprime loans were.

00:29:10.115 --> 00:29:13.451
Since real estate prices were
soaring, people could sell the house

00:29:13.551 --> 00:29:15.253
and get money back
even if they couldn't repay it.

00:29:15.386 --> 00:29:17.322
That caught the attention of
investors.

00:29:17.722 --> 00:29:19.457
What do you mean?

00:29:19.991 --> 00:29:21.559
In other words

00:29:21.626 --> 00:29:25.363
the subprime loans themselves were
turned into investment products.

00:29:26.264 --> 00:29:29.734
The interest paid by borrowers
became the return for investors.

00:29:30.001 --> 00:29:32.804
It was promoted as
a "can't lose" investment product

00:29:32.904 --> 00:29:35.473
and the market kept growing rapidly.

00:29:35.707 --> 00:29:36.775
I see.

00:29:36.875 --> 00:29:41.112
But then, the housing bubble burst,
and houses stopped selling.

00:29:42.147 --> 00:29:44.849
And the funds that had
incorporated subprime loans

00:29:44.949 --> 00:29:47.218
where the Lehman Brothers
had invested heavily

00:29:47.318 --> 00:29:49.921
started to decline,
and they eventually went bankrupt.

00:29:52.157 --> 00:29:55.727
That triggered
a global financial freeze.

00:29:55.927 --> 00:29:57.529
So that's the Lehman Shock.

00:29:57.896 --> 00:30:01.299
They took advantage of
the dreams of low-income people

00:30:01.733 --> 00:30:03.501
who wanted to own homes
just to make money?

00:30:04.602 --> 00:30:05.670
Scumbags.

00:30:08.606 --> 00:30:09.941
That's what my father said, too.

00:30:10.942 --> 00:30:14.779
"Finance has forgotten
its true mission," he said.

00:30:17.515 --> 00:30:22.654
He deeply regretted
becoming a living witness to that.

00:30:24.055 --> 00:30:27.358
If we could create
a good financial product

00:30:27.659 --> 00:30:29.694
he said he'd love to help us out.

00:30:34.199 --> 00:30:36.100
To fulfill my father's wish

00:30:37.268 --> 00:30:39.470
I wanted to create
financial products.

00:30:43.775 --> 00:30:45.643
Why did you keep something
so important to yourself?

00:30:46.377 --> 00:30:47.378
What?

00:30:47.545 --> 00:30:48.680
I mean, why would I tell anyone?

00:30:48.813 --> 00:30:50.548
That's an important thing to share!

00:30:51.115 --> 00:30:53.785
Look! Look at Miyazawa's face!

00:30:53.885 --> 00:30:54.886
What?

00:30:54.986 --> 00:30:56.855
You were moved, weren't you?

00:30:56.955 --> 00:30:59.057
You were totally moved by
Fuyuki's story.

00:30:59.157 --> 00:31:00.758
Shut up, Tokumori! Be quiet!

00:31:00.859 --> 00:31:03.761
When the Lehman Shock happened,
I was still just a baby.

00:31:03.862 --> 00:31:04.929
So I had no idea.

00:31:06.831 --> 00:31:09.901
During summer break, I told him
that I wanted to go into finance.

00:31:10.201 --> 00:31:11.903
That's when
he first told me this story.

00:31:13.972 --> 00:31:14.973
That's why.

00:31:25.683 --> 00:31:28.686
At first, I thought it would give us
an edge in the business contest

00:31:29.587 --> 00:31:32.523
if we incorporated welfare
or social contribution.

00:31:33.358 --> 00:31:34.859
But now you think differently?

00:31:35.860 --> 00:31:38.329
That mindset was
shallow to begin with.

00:31:39.464 --> 00:31:41.699
It's something we should
dedicate our lives to.

00:31:42.000 --> 00:31:43.902
Using it just to get into college...

00:31:47.772 --> 00:31:50.808
It's ultimately just
prioritizing our own gain.

00:31:53.978 --> 00:31:55.680
After hearing Fuyuki's story

00:31:56.481 --> 00:32:01.586
I clearly realized that I want to
create a financial product

00:32:04.822 --> 00:32:06.658
that would help shape
the ideal society we envision.

00:32:14.332 --> 00:32:15.934
Please lend us your ideas!

00:32:19.504 --> 00:32:20.605
Please help us!

00:32:23.141 --> 00:32:26.144
Miyazawa, you already
said the answer at the start.

00:32:28.146 --> 00:32:29.147
What?

00:32:30.615 --> 00:32:32.784
You went on study tours
during summer break, right?

00:32:39.924 --> 00:32:43.161
The waste management company
with the renewable system

00:32:43.294 --> 00:32:44.929
and the custom shoes for elderly!

00:32:46.130 --> 00:32:47.398
I get it now.

00:32:49.300 --> 00:32:51.302
We need to
think about where to invest!

00:32:52.704 --> 00:32:53.905
Yeah, that's it.

00:32:54.706 --> 00:32:57.775
Not just allocating
a portion of returns to social causes

00:32:58.643 --> 00:33:01.446
but creating a financial product
that contributes to society.

00:33:02.380 --> 00:33:03.448
In other words

00:33:03.815 --> 00:33:06.617
that might be
what it means to design society.

00:33:14.225 --> 00:33:16.427
You guys can come up
with the rest yourself, right?

00:33:17.562 --> 00:33:18.563
What?

00:33:18.997 --> 00:33:21.632
Kanzaki, you're starting to
sound like Okami.

00:33:23.234 --> 00:33:25.169
What? Oh, shut up.

00:33:25.770 --> 00:33:27.105
Hold on!

00:33:27.205 --> 00:33:28.373
I think it's here! My moment!

00:33:28.439 --> 00:33:29.440
– What?
– What?

00:33:29.741 --> 00:33:30.942
Ready, go!

00:33:31.275 --> 00:33:32.310
Send!

00:33:32.910 --> 00:33:34.746
Registration Complete

00:33:37.181 --> 00:33:40.952
Yes! Yes! Yes!

00:33:42.320 --> 00:33:44.655
Let's go, let's go!

00:33:45.289 --> 00:33:46.457
Everyone!

00:33:46.557 --> 00:33:47.592
Everyone!

00:33:49.260 --> 00:33:51.729
We have news about the
High School Business Project Contest.

00:33:51.896 --> 00:33:54.365
We've officially made it
to the final round!

00:33:54.465 --> 00:33:55.500
Wow!

00:33:56.134 --> 00:33:57.402
It's actually a big deal.

00:33:57.468 --> 00:33:59.470
This is the first time
in our school's history.

00:34:00.705 --> 00:34:03.274
The final presentation
is this Saturday.

00:34:03.741 --> 00:34:07.045
It's open to the public and
we need the audience to cheer for us.

00:34:07.311 --> 00:34:08.479
So please come support us!

00:34:08.846 --> 00:34:10.081
We hope to see you there.

00:34:10.148 --> 00:34:11.349
– All right!
– Good one!

00:34:11.449 --> 00:34:12.450
Please!

00:34:12.550 --> 00:34:14.018
We're counting on you!

00:34:15.453 --> 00:34:17.655
You're coming this Saturday, right?

00:34:17.755 --> 00:34:19.257
Wait, are you going, sir?

00:34:19.991 --> 00:34:23.728
This BizCon is different
from the others.

00:34:24.562 --> 00:34:27.432
It will skyrocket
Rintoku's reputation.

00:34:28.933 --> 00:34:33.671
We need to show that we're not
just a school focused on exams.

00:34:35.706 --> 00:34:38.443
I really want to make this happen.

00:34:41.779 --> 00:34:44.749
– Are you going, Makino?
– What, you too, Tsubuki?

00:34:45.349 --> 00:34:49.087
Mr. Tsukada is freaking out,
thinking it might upset Nagatacho.

00:34:49.720 --> 00:34:53.758
Well, Team Mikami might say something

00:34:53.825 --> 00:34:55.359
to challenge the government.

00:34:55.760 --> 00:34:57.628
That's why Mr.Tsukada
is being so cautious.

00:34:57.728 --> 00:35:00.331
Right. And if they do
something like that

00:35:00.498 --> 00:35:03.134
it'll get leaked straight to
the Cabinet Personnel Bureau.

00:35:03.534 --> 00:35:05.203
It would seriously affect
the appointment of

00:35:05.303 --> 00:35:06.504
the next administrative
vice minister.

00:35:06.637 --> 00:35:10.374
Exactly. The countdown to
Tsukada's big debut as vice minister

00:35:10.441 --> 00:35:12.043
is now shrouded in uncertainty.

00:35:12.944 --> 00:35:15.746
Wow! Mikami is amazing, isn't he?

00:35:16.347 --> 00:35:17.348
Yeah.

00:35:18.449 --> 00:35:21.352
He's somehow started
winning over the students' hearts.

00:35:22.854 --> 00:35:25.556
He's got that hot-and-cold bomb
built in, after all.

00:35:26.124 --> 00:35:27.492
Seriously.

00:35:30.728 --> 00:35:32.263
It's so annoying.

00:35:44.709 --> 00:35:46.611
– Oh no!
– What?

00:35:46.711 --> 00:35:49.080
That bureaucrat suspected in
the revolving door controversy.

00:35:49.180 --> 00:35:51.115
– What about it?
– There's an update on that.

00:35:51.182 --> 00:35:52.383
"The Shocking Past of
the Bureaucrat-Turned-Teacher"

00:35:55.987 --> 00:35:56.988
Mikami.

00:36:01.325 --> 00:36:03.127
Making it to the finals
is impressive!

00:36:03.427 --> 00:36:04.529
I didn't do anything.

00:36:04.629 --> 00:36:07.131
Come on, you're probably
pulling strings behind the scenes.

00:36:07.498 --> 00:36:10.101
It's a fascinating topic, right?
High schoolers and finance.

00:36:10.201 --> 00:36:11.569
You're not suddenly going to

00:36:11.636 --> 00:36:14.772
pull something weird like
the school festival again, are you?

00:36:14.872 --> 00:36:17.909
That'd be a serious rule violation
and a huge problem.

00:36:18.009 --> 00:36:20.211
It could even destroy
the AO entrance system.

00:36:20.311 --> 00:36:21.479
No way that would happen.

00:36:22.013 --> 00:36:24.248
Why, hello!
Everyone's gathered, I see.

00:36:24.348 --> 00:36:26.284
Mr. Nakaoka, long time no see.

00:36:26.384 --> 00:36:28.586
– You look great.
– Thanks to you, sir.

00:36:28.686 --> 00:36:30.087
I hear you're a judge today.

00:36:30.421 --> 00:36:33.958
Yes. Believe it or not,
I work as a consultant for startups.

00:36:34.492 --> 00:36:36.928
Please look after our students.

00:36:37.028 --> 00:36:40.598
Just so you know,
I don't play favorites.

00:36:40.698 --> 00:36:41.966
Of course not.

00:36:42.300 --> 00:36:45.336
I know very well
how strict you are about that.

00:36:47.104 --> 00:36:49.140
By the way, do you know
where the competition HQ is?

00:36:49.240 --> 00:36:51.409
– Shall I take you there?
– I'd appreciate it.

00:36:51.509 --> 00:36:52.510
This way, please.

00:36:52.610 --> 00:36:55.680
Thank you to everyone from
Katsuragi Mirai Academy!

00:36:58.216 --> 00:37:00.651
It looks like it's a win
for Katsuragi Mirai.

00:37:00.952 --> 00:37:03.654
Did you give them advice,
Mr. Nakaoka?

00:37:04.222 --> 00:37:07.792
No, I'd never.
That would be like insider trading.

00:37:07.892 --> 00:37:09.493
Come on, now.

00:37:11.028 --> 00:37:13.798
Next up is "The Support Fund
for the Future Enterprises

00:37:13.898 --> 00:37:15.967
as Dreamed of
by High School Students."

00:37:16.567 --> 00:37:20.071
A finance-related topic?
Sounds fascinating!

00:37:20.738 --> 00:37:23.307
And now, making their
first appearance as a finalist...

00:37:23.407 --> 00:37:26.544
Please welcome the students
from Rintoku Academy High School!

00:37:29.480 --> 00:37:34.518
The participants are
Miyazawa Ryo, Fuyuki Ryuichiro

00:37:34.619 --> 00:37:38.122
Tokumori Jin and Tominaga Aoi
from Class 3-2.

00:37:38.489 --> 00:37:43.561
Let's see what kind of presentation
Rintoku Academy has in store for us.

00:37:44.161 --> 00:37:46.464
Please begin.

00:38:02.113 --> 00:38:05.116
Lehman Shock

00:38:05.516 --> 00:38:08.386
I'm sure everyone has
heard of this term before.

00:38:09.053 --> 00:38:13.424
But do you actually
know what happened?

00:38:14.759 --> 00:38:19.730
In the 1980s, brilliant physicists
and mathematicians

00:38:19.830 --> 00:38:21.932
entered the financial world

00:38:22.033 --> 00:38:25.303
and used computers
to create financial products.

00:38:27.071 --> 00:38:32.043
The amount of time for that to happen
is a staggering 576 years.

00:38:35.746 --> 00:38:37.982
Living modestly with time deposits

00:38:38.049 --> 00:38:42.286
is also taken from us by
the Rule of 72.

00:38:44.255 --> 00:38:47.658
Now, learning finance is mandatory
even for high schoolers.

00:38:48.292 --> 00:38:51.996
With policy interest rates
and wages at rock bottom

00:38:52.096 --> 00:38:56.100
among developed countries,
we are left to figure it out alone.

00:38:57.468 --> 00:38:59.637
Japan's national debt
exceeds 1 quadrillion yen.

00:38:59.870 --> 00:39:03.140
If the country ever
goes bankrupt in the future

00:39:04.275 --> 00:39:07.011
we can't say for sure that
deposit freezes won't happen.

00:39:08.212 --> 00:39:09.847
That's the reality we're facing.

00:39:10.514 --> 00:39:13.017
So we high schoolers
want to show the adults

00:39:13.617 --> 00:39:16.153
the original power of finance.

00:39:17.521 --> 00:39:21.459
This is a proposal for a solid but
socially impactful financial product

00:39:21.726 --> 00:39:26.630
where high school students
save a small amount monthly.

00:39:29.900 --> 00:39:35.005
Our fund begins by openly recruiting
companies we want to invest in.

00:39:35.639 --> 00:39:38.442
From those, we high schoolers,
along with the help of experts

00:39:38.542 --> 00:39:41.746
will choose the companies
we think should exist in the future

00:39:41.812 --> 00:39:43.447
and designate them
as investment targets.

00:39:43.681 --> 00:39:44.915
Through our investment

00:39:44.982 --> 00:39:48.185
the companies we want to preserve
for Japan's future will grow.

00:39:48.252 --> 00:39:50.354
That's the first "win".

00:39:52.690 --> 00:39:57.094
Then, a portion of the profits
will be used to support education

00:39:57.194 --> 00:39:59.230
in regions where
access to learning is limited.

00:39:59.630 --> 00:40:01.966
The returns are
not used for personal gain

00:40:02.032 --> 00:40:03.868
but directed toward
social contribution.

00:40:03.934 --> 00:40:05.903
That's the second "win".

00:40:07.238 --> 00:40:11.308
And the rest is distributed
to investors as returns.

00:40:12.410 --> 00:40:15.513
By investing, we get to experience

00:40:15.579 --> 00:40:19.150
how our own money
helps make society better.

00:40:19.216 --> 00:40:21.318
That's the third "win".

00:40:21.986 --> 00:40:25.456
My father works in finance.

00:40:27.291 --> 00:40:29.293
When he heard this plan,
this is what he said.

00:40:30.795 --> 00:40:31.862
"This is a fund...

00:40:34.432 --> 00:40:37.468
that can help financial professionals
regain our pride."

00:40:38.402 --> 00:40:42.440
Unexpectedly, we even
gained a fourth "win".

00:40:51.148 --> 00:40:53.083
This is not the time
for financial professionals

00:40:53.150 --> 00:40:54.718
to be getting back at each other.

00:40:55.386 --> 00:41:01.559
Neither school nor financial dramas
teach us the true meaning of finance.

00:41:03.794 --> 00:41:07.231
The true meaning of finance is...

00:41:12.536 --> 00:41:14.138
trust and mutual support.

00:41:18.609 --> 00:41:22.980
Money is what trust looks like
in physical form.

00:41:26.984 --> 00:41:31.989
We wanted to return to
the very origins of finance.

00:41:32.490 --> 00:41:34.325
That is how we came up
with this plan.

00:41:37.094 --> 00:41:38.896
To question
the true meaning of investment

00:41:38.996 --> 00:41:39.997
that adults have forgotten...

00:41:41.365 --> 00:41:43.367
To create a future
through financial investment...

00:41:44.568 --> 00:41:47.004
That's the business plan
we came up with.

00:41:49.373 --> 00:41:52.009
That concludes our presentation.

00:42:12.596 --> 00:42:14.265
Wow! What a fantastic presentation!

00:42:14.365 --> 00:42:16.000
I'm finalizing my scores.

00:42:16.100 --> 00:42:17.801
Wait. What about deliberations?

00:42:20.271 --> 00:42:22.406
Is there even a need
for rankings beyond this?

00:42:22.773 --> 00:42:23.774
Yes, but...

00:42:23.874 --> 00:42:27.444
For me, my job is based on trust.

00:42:28.445 --> 00:42:30.915
I'll be back before the results
are announced. Excuse me.

00:42:33.884 --> 00:42:36.120
We won!

00:42:38.689 --> 00:42:40.958
– Congratulations!
– Thank you so much!

00:42:41.091 --> 00:42:42.393
You're crying too much.

00:42:43.127 --> 00:42:44.128
Mr. Mikami!

00:42:44.228 --> 00:42:46.864
– Good job out there.
– Thank you!

00:42:47.331 --> 00:42:49.233
This victory was only possible
because of you, Mr. Mikami!

00:42:49.333 --> 00:42:51.769
I didn't do anything.
It was a team effort.

00:42:52.536 --> 00:42:54.305
Mr. Koreeda,
thank you so much as well.

00:42:54.405 --> 00:42:55.406
That was truly amazing.

00:42:55.506 --> 00:42:58.709
Wow, look at them
crowding around Mikami.

00:42:59.109 --> 00:43:00.744
He's totally become a star.

00:43:01.178 --> 00:43:03.714
I can't believe they actually won.

00:43:05.382 --> 00:43:07.051
Maybe it's just me.

00:43:08.452 --> 00:43:11.388
But I think
Mr. Mikami was crying a bit.

00:43:12.790 --> 00:43:13.991
No way!

00:43:14.058 --> 00:43:16.026
Dust probably got into his eyes
or something.

00:43:16.293 --> 00:43:17.695
Yeah, probably.

00:43:18.095 --> 00:43:21.298
Right, we're planning to celebrate
at that restaurant just over there.

00:43:21.398 --> 00:43:23.400
Mr. Mikami and Ms. Koreeda,
would you like to come?

00:43:23.500 --> 00:43:25.803
You go ahead. I need to
stop by the admin office first.

00:43:25.903 --> 00:43:28.172
Okay. Then let's go, Ms. Koreeda!

00:43:28.272 --> 00:43:29.673
Yeah! Let's go!

00:43:31.308 --> 00:43:33.677
– Today, it's my treat!
– Yay!

00:44:18.989 --> 00:44:20.658
There's something
we need to talk about.

00:44:21.025 --> 00:44:22.026
What is it?

00:44:24.662 --> 00:44:27.731
I heard something
from my dad yesterday.

00:44:29.466 --> 00:44:32.436
Tomorrow, your brother's case...

00:44:34.838 --> 00:44:36.240
It's going to be in a magazine.

00:44:38.509 --> 00:44:39.510
I see.

00:44:44.515 --> 00:44:45.582
What are you going to do?

00:44:46.617 --> 00:44:47.685
Nothing.

00:44:50.220 --> 00:44:51.522
Nothing?

00:44:53.357 --> 00:44:58.495
It's already over.

00:45:02.966 --> 00:45:04.101
It's not over, is it?

00:45:06.970 --> 00:45:08.272
If I were you...

00:45:12.142 --> 00:45:13.877
I wouldn't be able to
move on that easily.

00:45:21.752 --> 00:45:22.753
I...

00:45:26.657 --> 00:45:27.925
I'm okay now.

00:45:32.496 --> 00:45:33.664
So next...

00:45:34.465 --> 00:45:35.632
It's your turn.

00:45:42.272 --> 00:45:44.808
Maybe it's you who still
can't think of it as something

00:45:44.908 --> 00:45:46.310
that happened 20 years ago.

00:45:46.944 --> 00:45:49.313
Please tell me the truth.

00:45:49.646 --> 00:45:52.883
If I tell you, I'll stop being
even a former teacher.

00:45:52.983 --> 00:45:54.852
There's definitely a connection.

00:45:54.952 --> 00:45:56.587
And yet we still can't
get any solid evidence.

00:45:56.687 --> 00:45:58.689
We have to show them
that it's not so easy.

00:45:58.789 --> 00:46:00.057
I want to talk to you
about my brother.

00:46:00.157 --> 00:46:01.925
It was something
I should've shared with you.

00:46:02.025 --> 00:46:03.127
I thought we must never allow

00:46:03.193 --> 00:46:04.828
another person
like my brother to die.
