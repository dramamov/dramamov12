WEBVTT

00:00:02.769 --> 00:00:04.037
I said one every ten minutes.

00:00:04.104 --> 00:00:06.606
Enjoy being at home, Riko.

00:00:06.673 --> 00:00:07.674
This is imprisonment.

00:00:07.741 --> 00:00:09.876
What you're doing is insane!

00:00:10.443 --> 00:00:13.213
Why don't you understand?

00:00:15.015 --> 00:00:16.082
Riko?

00:00:16.750 --> 00:00:19.085
Riko!

00:00:25.325 --> 00:00:27.994
If you're with the one you love

00:00:28.061 --> 00:00:30.563
a child will bless you one day.

00:00:32.832 --> 00:00:35.335
That's what I believed.

00:00:37.070 --> 00:00:38.071
But...

00:00:40.373 --> 00:00:42.842
It'll be fine, Riko. I know it.

00:00:45.845 --> 00:00:46.846
Yeah.

00:00:50.050 --> 00:00:53.453
The test results say
the problem is on the husband's side.

00:00:58.992 --> 00:01:01.061
Unfortunately, a child is...

00:01:07.901 --> 00:01:09.102
This is great.

00:01:09.736 --> 00:01:10.737
Huh?

00:01:11.805 --> 00:01:16.810
After all, you and I are better off
with just the two of us.

00:01:28.254 --> 00:01:29.989
Let's be a family of two from now on.

00:01:34.427 --> 00:01:38.264
Something felt slightly off then.

00:01:38.331 --> 00:01:42.402
That feeling grew day by day until...

00:01:42.469 --> 00:01:43.470
Riko?

00:01:44.337 --> 00:01:45.605
Riko.

00:01:46.172 --> 00:01:48.408
Are you sure you don't need
to be hospitalized?

00:01:48.475 --> 00:01:49.642
What did the doctor say?

00:01:50.376 --> 00:01:51.544
Hey, Riko.

00:01:52.479 --> 00:01:53.646
Riko!

00:01:56.916 --> 00:01:58.051
I'm sorry.

00:02:01.187 --> 00:02:02.355
Riko.

00:02:03.623 --> 00:02:04.791
Ryosuke.

00:02:06.793 --> 00:02:07.827
Let go of me.

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:11.598
Please let go.

00:02:12.265 --> 00:02:13.500
Please let go!

00:02:16.136 --> 00:02:18.404
I'm pregnant!

00:02:22.709 --> 00:02:23.810
Pregnant?

00:02:26.146 --> 00:02:27.313
You?

00:02:33.153 --> 00:02:34.554
I see.

00:02:35.288 --> 00:02:37.824
- A kid.
- Getting to safety.

00:02:39.626 --> 00:02:40.660
I see.

00:02:40.727 --> 00:02:45.665
I really am... sorry about this.

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:49.169
You did it, Riko.

00:02:49.235 --> 00:02:51.404
- It's our baby!
- How?

00:02:51.471 --> 00:02:54.107
You already know that you're...

00:02:59.779 --> 00:03:02.715
Let's be a family of three
from now on.

00:03:09.956 --> 00:03:12.192
Heart rate falling.

00:03:15.895 --> 00:03:17.297
Riko, get in.

00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:22.068
I'm sorry.

00:03:33.479 --> 00:03:36.149
Heart rate rising.

00:03:49.696 --> 00:03:51.397
- Where are you going?
- Safety precaution.

00:03:51.464 --> 00:03:53.333
- Please go!
- Please put on your seatbelt.

00:03:53.399 --> 00:03:54.734
Our seatbelts.

00:03:54.801 --> 00:03:56.302
Riko, where are you going?

00:03:56.369 --> 00:03:58.071
Seatbelts.

00:03:58.137 --> 00:04:00.406
- We put on our seatbelts.
- They're on.

00:04:05.445 --> 00:04:07.780
Huh? This road's sealed off.

00:04:10.550 --> 00:04:14.687
- Wait!
- Your acquaintance said something.

00:04:14.754 --> 00:04:16.456
Welcome back.

00:04:16.522 --> 00:04:17.790
- Is there an address?
- Just go!

00:04:17.857 --> 00:04:18.925
Anywhere's fine!

00:04:18.992 --> 00:04:20.827
- Please just go!
- Do you have change?

00:04:20.893 --> 00:04:22.895
- Please!
- Did you pack some coins?

00:04:22.962 --> 00:04:24.430
Where are you going?

00:04:24.497 --> 00:04:25.565
Riko.

00:04:25.632 --> 00:04:27.300
Hurry, go forward!

00:04:27.367 --> 00:04:30.336
The cherry blossoms are blooming,
even in the cold.

00:04:30.403 --> 00:04:32.839
Are these Kawazuzakura trees?

00:04:32.905 --> 00:04:35.875
Maybe this is a new start for us.

00:04:35.942 --> 00:04:37.343
Can you go faster?

00:04:37.410 --> 00:04:40.446
Now we can enjoy life with our child.

00:04:41.648 --> 00:04:44.284
Kawazuzakura!

00:05:20.386 --> 00:05:23.656
Heart rate has reached
180 beats per second.

00:05:28.361 --> 00:05:29.662
I wonder if it's a boy.

00:05:30.863 --> 00:05:32.165
Or maybe it's a girl.

00:06:52.245 --> 00:06:55.348
PLEASE DIE MY BELOVED

00:07:14.267 --> 00:07:16.769
Hey, today's our wedding anniversary

00:07:16.836 --> 00:07:19.305
so how about we go out to eat?

00:07:20.006 --> 00:07:24.177
Oh, but this just came in the mail.

00:07:24.243 --> 00:07:25.545
What is that?

00:07:25.611 --> 00:07:27.547
A computer that I've always wanted.

00:07:27.613 --> 00:07:31.117
It's a GTX 1080 Ti with
a Core i9 processor. Cool, right?

00:07:31.784 --> 00:07:34.587
I didn't catch any of that.

00:07:37.089 --> 00:07:39.358
I want to get this set up

00:07:39.425 --> 00:07:42.295
so having dinner at home
would be nice.

00:07:42.795 --> 00:07:44.997
Let's go another day. Sorry.

00:08:14.961 --> 00:08:18.231
THIS FOLDER IS EMPTY

00:08:23.636 --> 00:08:25.438
I don't see any clues.

00:08:48.561 --> 00:08:50.396
How is Yuna doing?

00:08:51.063 --> 00:08:52.431
What?

00:08:52.498 --> 00:08:54.233
Is she doing okay?

00:08:56.269 --> 00:08:58.638
Has her asthma acted up?

00:08:59.906 --> 00:09:02.275
She has her medicine, right?

00:09:04.477 --> 00:09:06.679
- Hey.
- You're so annoying.

00:09:06.746 --> 00:09:08.781
But I'm worried.

00:09:08.848 --> 00:09:11.250
Then get my settlement money already.

00:09:11.317 --> 00:09:13.119
My 30 million yen.

00:09:20.860 --> 00:09:22.128
Thank you.

00:09:22.662 --> 00:09:24.096
This is a huge help.

00:09:25.565 --> 00:09:26.699
How are you feeling?

00:09:28.301 --> 00:09:29.402
I'm fine.

00:09:34.440 --> 00:09:38.044
If my husband dies

00:09:40.179 --> 00:09:42.081
will you be mine?

00:09:46.018 --> 00:09:47.019
Yeah.

00:09:51.290 --> 00:09:52.358
Riko.

00:09:53.392 --> 00:09:55.161
About the baby...

00:10:08.307 --> 00:10:09.642
Riko.

00:10:09.709 --> 00:10:11.577
You're there, right?

00:10:11.644 --> 00:10:12.878
Open up.

00:10:14.146 --> 00:10:16.349
Riko.

00:10:18.517 --> 00:10:19.619
Riko?

00:10:22.288 --> 00:10:24.457
Riko!

00:10:26.092 --> 00:10:28.227
Riko.

00:10:28.995 --> 00:10:30.963
- Why is Hiroki here?
- Riko.

00:10:32.999 --> 00:10:34.967
- Riko.
- I'll confront him.

00:10:35.034 --> 00:10:36.235
Don't go.

00:10:36.302 --> 00:10:38.170
No, don't open it!

00:10:38.237 --> 00:10:41.040
- Don't open it!
- I'll call the police.

00:10:42.074 --> 00:10:43.976
I'm home, Riko!

00:10:44.043 --> 00:10:46.178
I made dinner, so let's eat.

00:10:46.245 --> 00:10:49.415
Tonight's my homemade
stamina stir-fry.

00:10:49.482 --> 00:10:51.150
Eat up and get some nutrients.

00:10:51.951 --> 00:10:54.687
Huh? Do you hate garlic?
You like it, right?

00:10:55.655 --> 00:10:58.791
I really am sorry about this.

00:10:58.858 --> 00:11:01.661
I know I have no right to say this

00:11:01.727 --> 00:11:04.730
but I want to break up with you.

00:11:04.797 --> 00:11:05.798
Please.

00:11:06.666 --> 00:11:08.834
Let's speak together
with our lawyers.

00:11:08.901 --> 00:11:10.970
I'll pay a settlement.

00:11:12.872 --> 00:11:14.707
My homemade stamina stir-fry.

00:11:15.908 --> 00:11:17.009
It's cold.

00:11:19.445 --> 00:11:20.746
I'll reheat it.

00:11:21.947 --> 00:11:23.883
Where's the kitchen?

00:11:23.949 --> 00:11:25.251
Hey!

00:11:27.053 --> 00:11:29.422
That's not the kitchen.

00:11:29.488 --> 00:11:33.392
I'll eat anything,
so just break up with me.

00:11:34.760 --> 00:11:36.495
KUMABE ESTATE

00:11:36.562 --> 00:11:40.666
I heard some of our tenants
requested changes in the interior.

00:11:40.733 --> 00:11:42.835
What do they want specifically?

00:11:42.902 --> 00:11:45.705
Well, the supermarkets requested

00:11:45.771 --> 00:11:49.975
that we increase the capacity
of their refrigerators.

00:11:50.042 --> 00:11:53.079
- Power sources need to be redone.
- Is something wrong?

00:11:53.813 --> 00:11:55.181
No, it's nothing.

00:12:03.389 --> 00:12:06.492
Playing voicemail.

00:12:07.626 --> 00:12:09.562
Why aren't you picking up?

00:12:09.628 --> 00:12:11.530
I knew something was wrong with you.

00:12:12.565 --> 00:12:14.400
End of message.

00:12:19.672 --> 00:12:21.640
MITSUHIRO'S MOM

00:12:21.707 --> 00:12:23.075
Scary.

00:12:24.110 --> 00:12:27.113
SHINICHI SENDA

00:12:34.587 --> 00:12:36.088
Why are we here?

00:12:36.989 --> 00:12:39.258
You seemed stressed out.

00:12:39.325 --> 00:12:40.359
Am I right?

00:12:41.227 --> 00:12:43.462
I've never done this before.

00:12:43.529 --> 00:12:45.731
It's okay. Give it a try.

00:12:45.798 --> 00:12:46.999
I'll show you the ropes.

00:12:49.001 --> 00:12:50.770
It'll feel good.

00:12:50.836 --> 00:12:52.505
Picture someone you hate

00:12:52.571 --> 00:12:55.808
and send them flying
with all your strength.

00:12:55.875 --> 00:12:58.310
Don't speak like it's that easy.

00:12:58.377 --> 00:12:59.678
Here.

00:12:59.745 --> 00:13:00.813
Go on.

00:13:01.413 --> 00:13:03.082
Oh, right.

00:13:03.149 --> 00:13:04.216
Your shoes.

00:13:09.255 --> 00:13:10.289
I'm fine.

00:13:14.226 --> 00:13:15.528
That's some confidence.

00:13:16.662 --> 00:13:18.430
Which side do I stand on?

00:13:19.298 --> 00:13:22.601
- Whichever is easier to swing from.
- Easier to swing from?

00:13:24.203 --> 00:13:25.638
This way, huh?

00:13:26.772 --> 00:13:28.674
Hit it and
I'll treat you to anything.

00:13:29.408 --> 00:13:31.911
Then I want beer.

00:13:31.977 --> 00:13:33.012
Okay.

00:13:39.218 --> 00:13:41.387
Focus on the ball.

00:13:45.057 --> 00:13:47.426
Don't run. Face the ball head-on.

00:13:47.927 --> 00:13:48.928
All right.

00:14:08.447 --> 00:14:09.882
HOME RUN

00:14:09.949 --> 00:14:12.585
Home run. Congratulations.

00:14:12.651 --> 00:14:14.420
Yes!

00:14:14.486 --> 00:14:16.956
Wow, that's incredible!

00:14:17.022 --> 00:14:18.557
I did it!

00:14:19.258 --> 00:14:21.994
Yes! I might be a genius!

00:14:22.061 --> 00:14:23.629
Baseball's fun.

00:14:28.200 --> 00:14:29.635
Phew, I'm tired.

00:14:31.537 --> 00:14:33.606
Good work back there.

00:14:36.308 --> 00:14:38.043
- Sorry.
- Thank you.

00:14:40.746 --> 00:14:41.780
There we go.

00:14:43.616 --> 00:14:44.884
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

00:14:52.258 --> 00:14:53.292
Delicious.

00:14:54.226 --> 00:14:57.263
Nothing beats beer after a workout.

00:14:57.329 --> 00:14:58.497
I agree.

00:14:59.064 --> 00:15:00.599
I could get used to this.

00:15:01.267 --> 00:15:04.637
Oh, want to go camping sometime?

00:15:05.838 --> 00:15:07.606
- Camping?
- Yes.

00:15:08.140 --> 00:15:10.509
Drinking beer surrounded by nature
is great too.

00:15:18.117 --> 00:15:19.852
Not your style?

00:15:21.387 --> 00:15:22.688
Oh, no.

00:15:24.123 --> 00:15:27.126
I think I want
to explore batting more.

00:15:28.360 --> 00:15:29.461
I see.

00:15:31.864 --> 00:15:33.299
Oh, right.

00:15:33.365 --> 00:15:35.301
I'm thinking about
changing companies.

00:15:35.367 --> 00:15:36.368
Changing companies?

00:15:37.236 --> 00:15:39.138
I was headhunted.

00:15:39.204 --> 00:15:42.007
What? That's totally amazing.

00:15:42.074 --> 00:15:43.542
Congratulations.

00:15:43.609 --> 00:15:45.377
Thank you.

00:15:46.679 --> 00:15:48.347
That's exciting.

00:15:48.414 --> 00:15:50.449
A fun, new life is about to begin.

00:15:52.318 --> 00:15:53.919
Whatever you do

00:15:53.986 --> 00:15:56.889
it's important not to run away.

00:15:56.956 --> 00:15:58.891
And keep your eyes on the ball.

00:16:01.360 --> 00:16:02.995
Good work, everyone.

00:16:03.062 --> 00:16:07.132
I bought some sweets
from one of our new tenants

00:16:07.199 --> 00:16:09.835
so please give them a try...

00:16:10.736 --> 00:16:12.571
Did something happen?

00:16:16.208 --> 00:16:18.077
While you were out

00:16:18.143 --> 00:16:20.179
a guest came to the office.

00:16:20.245 --> 00:16:21.814
A guest?

00:16:21.880 --> 00:16:22.948
Who?

00:16:23.615 --> 00:16:25.751
Your husband's mom.

00:16:26.485 --> 00:16:28.554
What? My mom-in-law?

00:16:30.456 --> 00:16:31.824
Why?

00:16:34.059 --> 00:16:37.062
Did she say anything?

00:16:38.063 --> 00:16:41.200
She said she wanted to talk
about your husband.

00:16:41.266 --> 00:16:43.068
She was at her wits' end.

00:16:51.643 --> 00:16:54.947
STAIRWAY TO HEAVEN
LOOKING FOR CAST MEMBERS

00:16:59.985 --> 00:17:01.420
Here for an interview?

00:17:06.859 --> 00:17:10.696
It's okay. It's good money if you
work hard on your customer service.

00:17:12.998 --> 00:17:13.999
I'm sorry.

00:17:15.234 --> 00:17:16.301
You're leaving?

00:17:22.107 --> 00:17:23.342
Yurika.

00:17:26.979 --> 00:17:28.147
Hello.

00:17:32.051 --> 00:17:33.352
Good afternoon.

00:17:37.022 --> 00:17:38.824
Where's Yuna?

00:17:41.060 --> 00:17:42.895
She's at her grandma's house.

00:17:43.695 --> 00:17:47.399
Aw, I wanted to play with her.

00:17:51.203 --> 00:17:53.939
It's almost her birthday, right?

00:17:56.275 --> 00:17:57.876
What are you doing to celebrate?

00:18:01.046 --> 00:18:03.682
My husband always goes
all-out every year.

00:18:04.616 --> 00:18:06.718
Decorating the entire room...

00:18:06.785 --> 00:18:08.454
baking a cake...

00:18:08.520 --> 00:18:09.855
Oh, right.

00:18:09.922 --> 00:18:13.525
He even buys all these presents.
A huge commotion.

00:18:14.993 --> 00:18:16.028
Really?

00:18:17.529 --> 00:18:18.797
I'm sure you're excited.

00:18:21.133 --> 00:18:22.167
Yes.

00:18:22.901 --> 00:18:26.205
Well, I have to go cook dinner,
so I'll see you.

00:18:26.872 --> 00:18:27.873
Okay.

00:18:36.548 --> 00:18:39.384
Hey, Mommy.

00:18:39.451 --> 00:18:44.556
Daddy's never given me
a birthday present.

00:18:53.832 --> 00:18:55.734
30 million...

00:18:58.804 --> 00:19:00.305
I have to do something.

00:19:06.011 --> 00:19:07.045
Riko...

00:19:10.782 --> 00:19:12.851
Why aren't you picking up?

00:19:14.486 --> 00:19:16.155
Maya...

00:19:16.755 --> 00:19:19.091
YURIKA

00:19:26.398 --> 00:19:27.499
Maya?

00:19:32.137 --> 00:19:33.238
Saki.

00:19:33.939 --> 00:19:35.240
Sorry to bother you.

00:19:38.143 --> 00:19:39.378
What did you want?

00:19:43.949 --> 00:19:46.718
My brother had an affair?

00:19:48.887 --> 00:19:49.888
Yeah.

00:19:52.457 --> 00:19:54.760
Sorry I couldn't tell you earlier.

00:19:56.128 --> 00:19:57.229
That can't be.

00:19:58.897 --> 00:20:01.233
My brother's not capable of that.

00:20:08.207 --> 00:20:09.942
He admitted it.

00:20:11.510 --> 00:20:12.511
What?

00:20:14.613 --> 00:20:15.714
He apologized.

00:20:20.719 --> 00:20:22.621
I don't know who it was with

00:20:23.589 --> 00:20:27.492
but I think he's probably with her.

00:20:32.097 --> 00:20:33.165
So...

00:20:36.235 --> 00:20:39.238
can you tell your mom that?

00:20:40.939 --> 00:20:43.442
I don't think she'd believe me.

00:20:47.246 --> 00:20:48.247
Okay.

00:20:53.552 --> 00:20:54.620
Thank you.

00:21:00.025 --> 00:21:01.960
Everyone's so useless...

00:21:03.629 --> 00:21:04.930
Maya...

00:21:09.735 --> 00:21:13.105
Ryosuke
I'll be working late today. Sorry

00:21:15.907 --> 00:21:16.908
I'm home.

00:21:19.444 --> 00:21:20.679
Look what I bought.

00:21:21.179 --> 00:21:22.414
Ta-da.

00:21:24.950 --> 00:21:27.386
Look, a cute little octopus.

00:21:29.755 --> 00:21:30.822
There's also...

00:21:34.993 --> 00:21:35.994
This.

00:21:37.829 --> 00:21:39.398
This color's better, huh?

00:21:40.599 --> 00:21:44.036
They'll look just like you,
so I'm sure this color will work.

00:21:44.102 --> 00:21:45.370
Hey, Hiroki.

00:21:45.437 --> 00:21:47.372
- Let's talk.
- Oh, right.

00:21:48.106 --> 00:21:50.309
I thought of a name too. See?

00:21:54.546 --> 00:21:56.415
Hiroko if it's a girl.

00:22:00.485 --> 00:22:02.421
Riki if it's a boy.

00:22:03.155 --> 00:22:04.790
They're based on our names.

00:22:05.957 --> 00:22:06.958
Please, Hiroki.

00:22:07.025 --> 00:22:09.394
I can't wait to meet you, Riki.

00:22:09.461 --> 00:22:10.862
NAME, RIKI

00:22:10.929 --> 00:22:12.331
Or are you Hiroko?

00:22:12.397 --> 00:22:16.401
FATHER, HIROKI KAGAMI
MOTHER, RIKO KAGAMI

00:22:16.468 --> 00:22:22.674
Even if a hundred years pass
Don't lose your love of me

00:22:23.775 --> 00:22:26.945
I've been causing trouble
In front of others

00:22:27.012 --> 00:22:29.748
Like I said, this baby is...

00:22:29.815 --> 00:22:35.687
Even so, you stay smiling
Right by my side

00:22:36.521 --> 00:22:39.624
Thank you for choosing me

00:22:39.691 --> 00:22:41.560
This baby isn't yours!

00:22:41.626 --> 00:22:46.531
Despite how much we trust each other

00:22:46.598 --> 00:22:51.737
There will be things
We don't understand

00:22:51.803 --> 00:22:53.004
Please stop!

00:22:53.071 --> 00:22:58.176
That loneliness
And living side-by-side

00:22:58.243 --> 00:23:04.883
Might be what people call love

00:23:06.318 --> 00:23:07.352
YURIKA

00:23:07.419 --> 00:23:08.787
Someday, a dad--

00:23:17.963 --> 00:23:19.598
Please.

00:23:19.664 --> 00:23:22.367
Let me meet Yuna,
just for her birthday.

00:23:24.669 --> 00:23:26.405
I want to celebrate it for her.

00:23:27.205 --> 00:23:28.206
Please.

00:23:32.544 --> 00:23:35.013
Is that really
how you ask for a favor?

00:23:54.599 --> 00:23:55.867
Please.

00:24:03.542 --> 00:24:05.877
- Fine, I'll let you see her.
- Really?

00:24:05.944 --> 00:24:07.145
Really?

00:24:08.814 --> 00:24:11.550
If you pay up
the 30 million yen settlement.

00:24:14.252 --> 00:24:16.621
You really don't learn, huh?

00:24:18.490 --> 00:24:21.026
You can't do anything right anyway.

00:24:21.092 --> 00:24:24.629
You should just live your life
doing as I say.

00:24:31.069 --> 00:24:33.705
I can't wait to buy my car.

00:24:41.746 --> 00:24:43.114
An affair?

00:24:44.883 --> 00:24:45.984
I knew it.

00:24:46.651 --> 00:24:49.554
She didn't tell the police, did she?

00:24:51.490 --> 00:24:53.425
I'm sure it's a lie.

00:24:53.492 --> 00:24:55.827
My brother's not that kind of guy.

00:24:56.761 --> 00:24:59.397
Coming up with an excuse like that...

00:24:59.464 --> 00:25:00.632
Suspicious, isn't it?

00:25:05.470 --> 00:25:06.905
Please, detective.

00:25:08.073 --> 00:25:09.341
Please look into her.

00:25:10.108 --> 00:25:12.277
Look into Maya.

00:25:15.247 --> 00:25:16.281
Hold on.

00:25:19.384 --> 00:25:20.418
Mr. Shimura.

00:25:39.404 --> 00:25:41.239
Let's dig deeper then.

00:25:44.042 --> 00:25:45.043
RESIGNATION REQUEST

00:25:45.110 --> 00:25:46.244
My resignation.

00:25:51.049 --> 00:25:53.385
I know this might be a burden...

00:25:55.720 --> 00:25:56.721
Okay.

00:26:01.560 --> 00:26:02.661
You can go.

00:26:07.666 --> 00:26:08.934
Did you think

00:26:09.701 --> 00:26:12.037
I'd try to stop you?

00:26:16.474 --> 00:26:19.277
I already know the company
doesn't value me.

00:26:21.546 --> 00:26:22.547
I see.

00:26:23.381 --> 00:26:24.416
Okay then.

00:26:27.052 --> 00:26:28.486
Goodbye.

00:26:40.799 --> 00:26:42.400
EMPLOYMENT CONTRACT

00:26:42.467 --> 00:26:44.869
I bet your husband is thrilled too.

00:26:45.637 --> 00:26:46.838
Huh?

00:26:46.905 --> 00:26:48.740
These are great benefits.

00:26:50.308 --> 00:26:51.710
Oh, right.

00:26:53.078 --> 00:26:54.646
Please sign here.

00:26:54.713 --> 00:26:55.714
Okay.

00:27:04.222 --> 00:27:05.390
This is good.

00:27:07.392 --> 00:27:08.393
With this

00:27:09.127 --> 00:27:11.463
I'll move forward into a new life.

00:27:16.835 --> 00:27:19.037
Here you are.

00:27:19.104 --> 00:27:21.272
Thank you. Allow me to review it.

00:27:42.127 --> 00:27:43.528
TOMATO MEATBALLS
FOR MY BELOVED RIKOPON

00:27:43.595 --> 00:27:45.563
HIROKI-STYLE STAMINA PORK
AND POTATO STEW, WARM IT UP, OKAY?

00:27:45.630 --> 00:27:47.866
INGREDIENTS FOR TOMORROW'S
LIVER AND LEEK STIR-FRY

00:27:56.608 --> 00:27:59.244
PUBLIC PAYPHONE

00:28:02.781 --> 00:28:03.848
Hello?

00:28:08.153 --> 00:28:09.654
Oh?

00:28:09.721 --> 00:28:12.357
So you'll answer a payphone?

00:28:15.827 --> 00:28:17.696
This is hilarious.

00:28:19.764 --> 00:28:21.733
Huh? Yurika?

00:28:26.204 --> 00:28:27.439
We're going.

00:28:28.640 --> 00:28:30.909
Huh? Going where?

00:28:30.975 --> 00:28:33.111
Are you seriously asking?

00:28:33.178 --> 00:28:34.646
You know where.

00:28:37.282 --> 00:28:39.117
Can I help you?

00:28:40.118 --> 00:28:43.088
Has your husband
contacted you since then?

00:28:44.189 --> 00:28:45.256
No.

00:28:46.524 --> 00:28:48.493
By the way, who was that man?

00:28:50.128 --> 00:28:51.796
I'm changing jobs.

00:28:52.530 --> 00:28:53.698
You are?

00:28:54.265 --> 00:28:55.433
Yes.

00:28:55.500 --> 00:28:57.001
They reached out to me.

00:28:57.736 --> 00:29:00.338
But isn't this a bad time for that?

00:29:02.373 --> 00:29:05.110
I have my own life.

00:29:06.478 --> 00:29:09.814
I don't want to lose my chance.
Isn't that normal?

00:29:11.516 --> 00:29:15.019
Now's your chance?
When your husband's gone?

00:29:16.988 --> 00:29:18.256
That's...

00:29:26.598 --> 00:29:30.135
Please get in contact again
if you find anything.

00:29:50.955 --> 00:29:53.158
Welcome home.

00:30:05.303 --> 00:30:07.472
- Is tea okay?
- Yeah.

00:30:08.106 --> 00:30:09.874
Or alcohol?

00:30:09.941 --> 00:30:11.976
Why are you acting so carefree?

00:30:12.043 --> 00:30:14.012
Oh, I have chamomile tea.

00:30:14.078 --> 00:30:16.915
How about this, Yurika?
It helps you relax.

00:30:16.981 --> 00:30:19.284
Huh? What do you mean by that?

00:30:19.350 --> 00:30:20.552
What?

00:30:21.419 --> 00:30:22.987
You seem agitated.

00:30:23.555 --> 00:30:26.124
- Stop treating me like I'm mental!
- Yurika.

00:30:26.191 --> 00:30:29.060
- Calm down.
- Looks like you're worked up.

00:30:30.395 --> 00:30:32.096
What's with you two?

00:30:32.163 --> 00:30:33.598
You won't answer my calls

00:30:33.665 --> 00:30:35.133
like you don't care.

00:30:35.200 --> 00:30:36.367
I'm sorry.

00:30:36.434 --> 00:30:38.269
Do you understand my situation?

00:30:38.336 --> 00:30:39.838
I know.

00:30:39.904 --> 00:30:43.341
I do, but I'm going through
some things too.

00:30:43.408 --> 00:30:44.676
Like changing jobs.

00:30:46.711 --> 00:30:47.912
Changing jobs?

00:30:49.147 --> 00:30:50.448
With the headhunter.

00:30:53.751 --> 00:30:55.019
EMPLOYMENT CONTRACT

00:30:55.086 --> 00:30:56.888
YEARLY SALARY: 15 MILLION YEN

00:30:56.955 --> 00:31:00.959
A yearly salary of 15 million yen?

00:31:02.560 --> 00:31:06.331
You're changing jobs to pay for
my settlement money?

00:31:06.397 --> 00:31:08.700
- Thank you.
- Stop that.

00:31:08.766 --> 00:31:10.301
As if I'd do that.

00:31:11.502 --> 00:31:13.571
I can't believe this.

00:31:14.205 --> 00:31:18.109
I might get taken to the police
and lose my daughter

00:31:18.176 --> 00:31:20.278
and yet you're...

00:31:22.413 --> 00:31:25.650
- Yurika!
- Stop, what are you--

00:31:26.784 --> 00:31:29.721
I won't let you get
a fresh start on your own!

00:31:35.093 --> 00:31:36.160
Seriously?

00:31:38.029 --> 00:31:39.697
You really don't get it?

00:31:41.132 --> 00:31:43.501
Well, yeah, you wouldn't know

00:31:44.569 --> 00:31:46.838
how important this is.

00:31:46.905 --> 00:31:49.574
You've never had a proper job.

00:31:49.641 --> 00:31:51.109
What?

00:31:51.175 --> 00:31:53.578
Is working that impressive?

00:31:53.645 --> 00:31:56.147
All you do is advertise
stupid shopping centers.

00:31:56.214 --> 00:31:58.883
- Stupid?
- Aren't they?

00:31:58.950 --> 00:32:02.186
Does it really have more value
than raising a child?

00:32:02.253 --> 00:32:04.389
You're terrible.

00:32:04.455 --> 00:32:06.624
Self-important moms like you

00:32:06.691 --> 00:32:09.160
are why people think
we're a bother to work with!

00:32:11.829 --> 00:32:14.432
People think you're a bother?

00:32:14.499 --> 00:32:16.501
That's because you're a bother!

00:32:16.567 --> 00:32:17.869
Who's a bother?

00:32:17.936 --> 00:32:20.672
- Stop!
- You! I'm talking about you!

00:32:20.738 --> 00:32:22.473
Even Mitsuhiro was struggling.

00:32:23.241 --> 00:32:25.109
How would you know that?

00:32:25.176 --> 00:32:26.945
It was all over his face.

00:32:27.011 --> 00:32:30.114
You could tell from his face
he didn't want to go home.

00:32:30.181 --> 00:32:31.816
When and where was that?

00:32:31.883 --> 00:32:33.184
Stop talking nonsense.

00:32:33.251 --> 00:32:36.087
- You're the one full of nonsense.
- No, you are.

00:32:36.154 --> 00:32:37.655
- It's you.
- It's you.

00:32:37.722 --> 00:32:39.023
I don't get you!

00:32:39.090 --> 00:32:41.192
- What the hell?
- Stop it!

00:32:41.259 --> 00:32:43.828
- Let go!
- You make no sense.

00:32:43.895 --> 00:32:45.296
You keep speaking gibberish--

00:32:45.363 --> 00:32:47.598
Get a grip, you two!

00:32:59.310 --> 00:33:00.745
Who do you think you are?

00:33:00.812 --> 00:33:04.082
- What?
- Always looking down on us.

00:33:04.148 --> 00:33:06.784
You think you're better
than us, right?

00:33:06.851 --> 00:33:08.086
Just so you know

00:33:08.152 --> 00:33:10.021
being the best out of us three

00:33:10.088 --> 00:33:12.357
isn't that impressive in society.

00:33:13.491 --> 00:33:16.227
You're the ones who are always
desperate for second place.

00:33:16.294 --> 00:33:18.730
What? Is that what you really think?

00:33:18.796 --> 00:33:21.299
- You're the worst.
- So what?

00:33:21.366 --> 00:33:23.735
You bastard!

00:33:23.801 --> 00:33:25.203
Wait, Yurika!

00:33:25.269 --> 00:33:26.938
Jeez!

00:33:29.607 --> 00:33:31.376
I got you now, jerk!

00:33:32.076 --> 00:33:34.779
I told you to stop already!

00:33:36.881 --> 00:33:40.118
- Stop!
- Hey, give me that!

00:33:42.186 --> 00:33:43.454
Stop!

00:33:44.422 --> 00:33:46.758
I'm pregnant!

00:33:53.264 --> 00:33:54.265
What?

00:33:56.067 --> 00:33:57.568
You're pregnant?

00:33:58.903 --> 00:33:59.937
You're kidding.

00:34:00.772 --> 00:34:01.773
It's true.

00:34:04.842 --> 00:34:05.977
Who's the dad?

00:34:07.478 --> 00:34:09.013
It's not my husband.

00:34:10.648 --> 00:34:12.216
It's my affair.

00:34:12.283 --> 00:34:13.451
No way.

00:34:14.318 --> 00:34:15.453
Are you keeping it?

00:34:17.755 --> 00:34:18.790
I want to.

00:34:20.425 --> 00:34:22.994
I want to live with him and the baby.

00:34:23.895 --> 00:34:24.929
But...

00:34:26.731 --> 00:34:30.334
at this rate, I can't get out of
my husband's shackles.

00:34:36.908 --> 00:34:38.309
Riko...

00:34:51.322 --> 00:34:52.957
There's no other way.

00:34:54.759 --> 00:34:55.760
Huh?

00:34:57.495 --> 00:34:58.796
Let's kill them.

00:35:03.101 --> 00:35:04.102
Yeah.

00:35:05.670 --> 00:35:07.305
My husband

00:35:09.307 --> 00:35:10.675
and Yurika's too.

00:35:13.111 --> 00:35:15.012
What are you two saying?

00:35:15.079 --> 00:35:17.949
Killing them is just...

00:35:21.052 --> 00:35:22.053
It'll be fine.

00:35:24.589 --> 00:35:26.257
I know we can pull it off.

00:35:29.827 --> 00:35:30.928
Yeah.

00:35:31.562 --> 00:35:33.698
- After all...
- Wait.

00:35:38.936 --> 00:35:39.937
Stop.

00:35:42.874 --> 00:35:44.175
It's...

00:35:46.344 --> 00:35:47.879
not our first time

00:35:51.149 --> 00:35:52.416
killing someone.

00:38:01.045 --> 00:38:02.780
- I'm Mayachin!
- I'm Rikopin!

00:38:02.847 --> 00:38:04.015
I'm Yurikankan!

00:38:04.081 --> 00:38:05.349
- Together
- Together

00:38:05.416 --> 00:38:06.984
- we're the Please Die Trio!
- we're the Please Die Trio!

00:38:07.051 --> 00:38:08.452
- Hello!
- Hello!

00:38:08.519 --> 00:38:11.322
This drama's getting
great reviews, huh?

00:38:11.389 --> 00:38:12.523
Stop bragging.

00:38:12.590 --> 00:38:15.459
Didn't your mom
teach you any modesty?

00:38:15.526 --> 00:38:19.563
Yeah, it's all thanks to everyone
watching our show.

00:38:19.630 --> 00:38:22.199
Anyway, what's happening next week?

00:38:22.266 --> 00:38:25.403
Finally, the secret from our past
is finally revealed.

00:38:25.469 --> 00:38:26.470
Really?

00:38:26.537 --> 00:38:28.739
I really wanna know. Tell me.

00:38:28.806 --> 00:38:30.474
Gimme all the details.

00:38:30.541 --> 00:38:33.678
Hey, if I do that,
it's not a preview anymore.

00:38:33.744 --> 00:38:35.379
Do as you see fit.

00:38:35.446 --> 00:38:37.982
Next week on Please Die My Beloved.

00:38:38.049 --> 00:38:39.150
Past Secrets and Bonds.

00:38:39.216 --> 00:38:41.919
Thanks for watching!
