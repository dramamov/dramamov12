Support Admin Watch on
kissasia.cam or kisskh.org

00:00:31.164 --> 00:00:32.165
What's that?

00:00:32.732 --> 00:00:34.734
Just a game.

00:00:35.435 --> 00:00:37.037
Is it fun?

00:00:37.437 --> 00:00:38.805
Yes, I guess.

00:00:40.974 --> 00:00:42.675
Should I try that, too?

00:00:43.209 --> 00:00:44.210
Sure.

00:00:48.982 --> 00:00:52.886
Hey, I forgot my English textbook.
Can I look with you?

00:00:53.386 --> 00:00:55.288
Okay, I guess.

00:00:56.256 --> 00:00:57.323
Yes!

00:00:58.324 --> 00:01:00.126
Okay, listen up, everybody!

00:01:00.727 --> 00:01:04.030
Mrs. Tachibana is on maternity leave.

00:01:04.297 --> 00:01:07.634
So your new tutor is starting today.

00:01:08.268 --> 00:01:10.670
Please come in.

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:35.495
I'm Minori Kume.

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:38.698
So nice to meet you.

00:01:48.741 --> 00:01:49.742
Have you picked

00:01:51.444 --> 00:01:52.445
your school yet?

00:01:53.113 --> 00:01:54.114
What?

00:01:54.981 --> 00:01:56.349
Gosh, I...

00:01:57.016 --> 00:01:58.017
Not yet.

00:02:01.087 --> 00:02:03.423
I had a hard time
deciding on a college.

00:02:03.790 --> 00:02:05.458
AIM STRAIGHT FOR SUCCESS!

00:02:05.525 --> 00:02:07.527
I wasn't sure until the last minute.

00:02:11.264 --> 00:02:14.334
In the end,
I got into the Faculty of Education

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:16.002
at Keiho University.

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:18.471
I see.

00:02:19.339 --> 00:02:23.009
INTO A SUMMER WE CAN'T LOSE!
SHAPE YOUR OWN FUTURE!

00:02:23.076 --> 00:02:26.479
If you want advice about your future,
I'm here for you.

00:02:28.281 --> 00:02:29.415
Thank you.

00:02:34.954 --> 00:02:35.955
Yes?

00:02:50.203 --> 00:02:51.204
It's not straight.

00:02:58.878 --> 00:03:00.113
My husband

00:03:01.314 --> 00:03:02.482
is having an affair.

00:03:06.519 --> 00:03:07.554
He has

00:03:08.655 --> 00:03:10.356
another family.

00:03:13.226 --> 00:03:14.494
His mistress

00:03:16.496 --> 00:03:19.265
and a son she dotes on.

00:03:44.524 --> 00:03:46.125
Maybe the boy is

00:03:47.860 --> 00:03:49.762
my husband's...

00:03:54.701 --> 00:03:57.537
I have to find out

00:04:01.374 --> 00:04:02.709
the truth about you.

00:04:06.379 --> 00:04:07.380
There.

00:04:08.348 --> 00:04:09.349
You're good.

00:04:12.418 --> 00:04:13.653
Nice to meet you.

00:04:15.521 --> 00:04:16.756
Wataru Miyake.

00:05:11.177 --> 00:05:16.416
UNTIL I DESTROYED
MY HUSBAND'S OTHER FAMILY

00:05:20.586 --> 00:05:21.821
Hey, Tsubasa!

00:05:23.756 --> 00:05:24.757
Mom?

00:05:27.760 --> 00:05:30.697
- Tsubasa! I'm home!
- Mom!

00:05:32.365 --> 00:05:33.733
Here, this is for you.

00:05:34.667 --> 00:05:37.503
- Pudding!
- Minori, you're home!

00:05:37.570 --> 00:05:39.906
I'm so sorry I'm late.

00:05:39.972 --> 00:05:43.076
Not to worry.
We played with clay today, didn't we?

00:05:43.142 --> 00:05:45.144
We did! Mom, look!

00:05:45.211 --> 00:05:49.148
Grandma is so bad at it.
She made this weird cat.

00:05:49.215 --> 00:05:52.318
Don't be so mean!
Grandma did her best.

00:05:52.385 --> 00:05:54.053
Mom, I want pudding!

00:05:54.187 --> 00:05:56.289
Sure! Let me go wash my hands.

00:05:56.356 --> 00:05:57.357
Okay.

00:05:58.491 --> 00:06:00.693
So, how did it go at the cram school?

00:06:01.527 --> 00:06:04.497
I had fun. The students were great.

00:06:04.764 --> 00:06:06.165
That's great.

00:06:06.232 --> 00:06:08.601
I'm glad you found a good job.

00:06:08.668 --> 00:06:09.702
Thank you.

00:06:10.169 --> 00:06:14.540
But what made you decide
to get a job suddenly?

00:06:14.807 --> 00:06:17.043
Had a change of heart or something?

00:06:17.977 --> 00:06:19.479
No money problems, right?

00:06:20.580 --> 00:06:21.581
Yes.

00:06:22.482 --> 00:06:25.485
Tsubasa doesn't need
as much attention now.

00:06:25.551 --> 00:06:28.287
I feel ready to work outside.

00:06:29.589 --> 00:06:32.091
But I feel bad
for relying on you so much.

00:06:32.158 --> 00:06:35.628
Don't worry about me.
But is Yudai okay with this?

00:06:36.596 --> 00:06:37.663
I think so.

00:06:38.464 --> 00:06:39.632
Yudai is...

00:06:41.200 --> 00:06:42.735
As a cram school tutor?

00:06:43.503 --> 00:06:44.504
Yes.

00:06:45.238 --> 00:06:47.106
Tsubasa is getting older now.

00:06:47.340 --> 00:06:49.075
Maybe I could start slow.

00:06:49.342 --> 00:06:51.844
Like just two days a week.

00:06:52.412 --> 00:06:55.748
Fine by me. But what about
when you're at work?

00:06:56.582 --> 00:06:57.884
I asked your mom

00:06:58.918 --> 00:07:02.288
to watch him for a few hours.

00:07:03.156 --> 00:07:04.157
I see.

00:07:06.025 --> 00:07:07.427
I guess that's all right.

00:07:11.130 --> 00:07:12.131
Yes.

00:07:12.932 --> 00:07:13.933
Thank you.

00:07:15.568 --> 00:07:17.136
I wasn't a smile of kindness

00:07:18.971 --> 00:07:20.807
but of indifference.

00:07:23.342 --> 00:07:25.812
Yudai is totally supportive.

00:07:26.179 --> 00:07:28.247
Okay. That's wonderful.

00:07:29.515 --> 00:07:32.618
Whatever I can do to help,
just tell me.

00:07:35.555 --> 00:07:36.923
Thank you so much.

00:07:40.426 --> 00:07:42.428
I could never tell my mother-in-law.

00:07:44.197 --> 00:07:45.198
This is

00:07:46.732 --> 00:07:48.534
our problem.

00:07:51.304 --> 00:07:52.738
Look, Mom!

00:07:57.844 --> 00:07:58.878
Mom?

00:08:01.814 --> 00:08:02.849
But what if

00:08:04.016 --> 00:08:06.285
Yudai is the dad of that boy?

00:08:08.287 --> 00:08:09.956
Then, what about us?

00:08:32.612 --> 00:08:35.915
I'll help you
with your studies from now on.

00:08:36.616 --> 00:08:37.850
Let's work hard.

00:08:39.185 --> 00:08:40.253
Yes, thank you.

00:08:42.421 --> 00:08:46.926
You scored below average in English.

00:08:48.160 --> 00:08:50.730
What part is the hardest for you?

00:08:51.898 --> 00:08:53.633
I'm weak at listening.

00:08:54.467 --> 00:08:56.936
- The final is next month, right?
- Yes.

00:08:57.537 --> 00:09:01.207
So, let's work
on your listening skills together.

00:09:01.774 --> 00:09:02.775
Okay.

00:09:03.376 --> 00:09:04.510
Now

00:09:06.212 --> 00:09:11.083
why don't we set your goal
and your rewards?

00:09:11.684 --> 00:09:13.386
- Rewards?
- Yes.

00:09:14.253 --> 00:09:18.190
Set your score goal first,
and if you reach it, reward yourself.

00:09:18.791 --> 00:09:19.792
Like what?

00:09:21.494 --> 00:09:23.396
Let's see...

00:09:26.299 --> 00:09:29.602
Hey, do you like Anko Panic, too?

00:09:29.969 --> 00:09:30.970
What?

00:09:31.103 --> 00:09:33.205
I've gotten into it recently.

00:09:35.141 --> 00:09:36.142
See?

00:09:37.243 --> 00:09:38.911
You know Anko Panic?

00:09:39.412 --> 00:09:42.348
You can play this online too, right?

00:09:42.682 --> 00:09:46.419
Yes. Playing online lets you send
Anko Lights to each other!

00:09:46.586 --> 00:09:48.321
Oh, really?

00:09:50.556 --> 00:09:51.958
I've got an idea.

00:09:52.959 --> 00:09:56.862
If you score more than 85%

00:09:57.163 --> 00:10:00.733
I'll send you ten Anko Lights.

00:10:01.567 --> 00:10:03.936
- Seriously?
- If you hit the target score.

00:10:05.905 --> 00:10:06.939
I'll do my best.

00:10:11.043 --> 00:10:13.679
You bit quicker than I thought, nice!

00:10:15.581 --> 00:10:16.782
Actually

00:10:17.984 --> 00:10:19.719
I already know a bit about you.

00:10:20.519 --> 00:10:21.520
By the way...

00:10:24.390 --> 00:10:26.959
you must get along well
with your mom.

00:10:29.161 --> 00:10:31.597
We get along okay.

00:10:32.698 --> 00:10:34.667
I heard your mom calls often.

00:10:34.800 --> 00:10:36.736
She's worried about your grades.

00:10:39.305 --> 00:10:41.073
My mom is overprotective.

00:10:41.741 --> 00:10:43.209
I tell her I'll be okay.

00:10:43.442 --> 00:10:45.011
But she doesn't trust me.

00:10:50.516 --> 00:10:52.051
What's she like?

00:10:53.452 --> 00:10:54.453
What do you mean?

00:10:56.222 --> 00:10:58.624
- Normal, I guess.
- Normal?

00:11:00.159 --> 00:11:01.494
What do you mean by normal?

00:11:03.229 --> 00:11:04.230
What?

00:11:05.097 --> 00:11:06.132
Why?

00:11:13.372 --> 00:11:14.373
To tell the truth...

00:11:16.976 --> 00:11:18.577
I didn't have a dad.

00:11:21.614 --> 00:11:22.748
I see.

00:11:24.884 --> 00:11:25.885
If...

00:11:28.287 --> 00:11:29.522
If I had a dad...

00:11:32.124 --> 00:11:34.193
my life might have been different.

00:11:41.834 --> 00:11:44.637
I'm sorry.
I shouldn't be talking about myself.

00:11:47.740 --> 00:11:48.741
Why did I do that?

00:11:52.211 --> 00:11:54.814
I guess I feel like
I could talk to you.

00:12:00.720 --> 00:12:02.888
Well, then...

00:12:03.222 --> 00:12:04.757
Let's set up a study plan.

00:12:06.425 --> 00:12:07.426
Sure.

00:12:09.495 --> 00:12:10.496
From now on

00:12:11.764 --> 00:12:13.899
you can tell me everything

00:12:16.402 --> 00:12:17.903
about your mom...

00:12:21.173 --> 00:12:22.708
and your dad.

00:12:28.714 --> 00:12:30.716
God, this is so good!

00:12:32.918 --> 00:12:34.019
You're exaggerating.

00:12:34.653 --> 00:12:37.289
I guess your no-fuss cooking
is my favorite.

00:12:37.690 --> 00:12:39.258
Is that a compliment?

00:12:40.826 --> 00:12:41.961
Of course it is.

00:12:43.696 --> 00:12:46.265
Isn't your wife a good cook?

00:12:47.032 --> 00:12:51.403
Her cooking is fancy, but I don't
feel like eating it every day.

00:12:51.837 --> 00:12:53.139
You're so mean.

00:12:54.039 --> 00:12:56.909
I would love to eat
your cooking every day.

00:12:57.343 --> 00:12:58.744
I'm flattered.

00:13:00.679 --> 00:13:03.749
Gosh, look what time it is.
You should head home soon.

00:13:04.049 --> 00:13:06.986
We still have a lot of time.
She's clueless.

00:13:08.420 --> 00:13:10.055
She doesn't suspect a thing.

00:13:11.791 --> 00:13:13.259
Well, that's good then.

00:13:14.994 --> 00:13:16.095
Where's Wataru?

00:13:17.129 --> 00:13:18.798
- Did he eat?
- Yes.

00:13:19.431 --> 00:13:22.535
He's been holed up in his room
studying for finals.

00:13:22.701 --> 00:13:25.738
Really? That's unusual.

00:13:26.405 --> 00:13:28.941
Right? I wonder
what's gotten into him.

00:13:30.509 --> 00:13:32.812
Any parent should be happy

00:13:32.878 --> 00:13:35.080
when a son is so studious.

00:14:02.541 --> 00:14:03.742
I can't believe it.

00:14:06.011 --> 00:14:08.981
Tutoring the son
of your husband's mistress?

00:14:10.749 --> 00:14:11.884
I realized.

00:14:13.686 --> 00:14:14.687
What?

00:14:15.020 --> 00:14:16.055
I...

00:14:17.590 --> 00:14:19.091
Even if I expose the affair

00:14:20.492 --> 00:14:22.328
and get compensation

00:14:23.596 --> 00:14:24.797
I won't be satisfied.

00:14:25.998 --> 00:14:29.368
I want him to truly pay for his sins.

00:14:36.442 --> 00:14:40.112
Yes, of course. I get how you feel.

00:14:41.714 --> 00:14:43.549
I'll do anything I can to help.

00:14:46.318 --> 00:14:47.386
It's just...

00:14:49.955 --> 00:14:53.058
Minori, you're really okay
with this, right?

00:14:53.926 --> 00:14:54.927
What do you mean?

00:14:56.729 --> 00:14:57.730
You know

00:14:58.898 --> 00:15:01.667
I've been watching you two
since high school.

00:15:03.202 --> 00:15:04.803
When you started dating Yudai

00:15:05.604 --> 00:15:07.673
it seemed like you really lit up.

00:15:09.375 --> 00:15:11.677
Seeing your smile at the wedding

00:15:12.711 --> 00:15:15.147
I thought, "Gosh, fate is real."

00:15:20.953 --> 00:15:25.057
What Yudai did was awful.
No doubt about it.

00:15:27.293 --> 00:15:29.728
I was so mad when I heard

00:15:30.029 --> 00:15:31.830
and probably said too much to you.

00:15:34.900 --> 00:15:35.901
But maybe

00:15:37.169 --> 00:15:38.604
you should think again.

00:15:42.641 --> 00:15:43.909
Have a real talk.

00:15:44.710 --> 00:15:48.047
Say what you feel,
everything you've held back.

00:15:52.451 --> 00:15:54.219
This is not just for your sake.

00:15:55.487 --> 00:15:56.889
You've got Tsubasa.

00:16:07.099 --> 00:16:08.834
Could talking with him

00:16:09.802 --> 00:16:11.236
really make a difference?

00:16:12.404 --> 00:16:13.906
These shoes.

00:16:14.373 --> 00:16:16.675
The laces keep coming undone.

00:16:18.077 --> 00:16:19.244
Do they?

00:16:20.612 --> 00:16:21.613
Then...

00:16:23.882 --> 00:16:26.452
what do I even want with this man?

00:16:27.553 --> 00:16:30.456
How do I want him to pay
for what he's done?

00:16:31.690 --> 00:16:34.893
What kind of look
do I want to see on him?

00:16:37.162 --> 00:16:38.897
I got it!

00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:43.602
Thank you. I'll see you later.

00:16:45.137 --> 00:16:46.605
You've got Tsubasa.

00:16:48.674 --> 00:16:49.675
Yudai!

00:16:52.811 --> 00:16:53.812
I need

00:16:54.613 --> 00:16:55.614
to talk to you

00:16:56.348 --> 00:16:57.916
later today.

00:16:59.551 --> 00:17:00.819
Can you come home early?

00:17:02.287 --> 00:17:04.623
What is it? Something serious?

00:17:05.724 --> 00:17:06.792
I'll tell you later.

00:17:07.860 --> 00:17:10.362
All right.
I'll try to come home early.

00:17:10.929 --> 00:17:12.765
- Okay.
- See you.

00:17:12.831 --> 00:17:13.832
Bye.

00:17:18.837 --> 00:17:19.838
Can I

00:17:21.874 --> 00:17:22.975
ever love

00:17:24.543 --> 00:17:27.546
this smile again?

00:17:33.419 --> 00:17:35.320
The exam is over,
and you're still studying?

00:17:35.687 --> 00:17:37.356
Well, we are seniors.

00:17:37.589 --> 00:17:38.857
How was the test?

00:17:39.491 --> 00:17:40.859
It was okay.

00:17:41.693 --> 00:17:43.228
Ms. Kume told you to study?

00:17:44.063 --> 00:17:45.764
What are you talking about?

00:17:46.832 --> 00:17:50.369
You seem a bit different
since she came.

00:17:51.170 --> 00:17:52.171
Not really.

00:17:53.038 --> 00:17:55.908
She just said it'd be bad
if I don't study harder.

00:17:58.444 --> 00:18:01.580
Hey, do you think
Ms. Kume is married?

00:18:02.581 --> 00:18:04.416
I don't know.

00:18:04.983 --> 00:18:08.654
She's so pretty, she must be married.

00:18:10.189 --> 00:18:11.990
- I want to be like her.
- I don't care.

00:18:14.593 --> 00:18:15.994
Good luck to both of us!

00:18:21.366 --> 00:18:22.768
ENGLISH EXAM, 92 OUT OF 100

00:18:22.835 --> 00:18:24.403
This is awesome!

00:18:24.670 --> 00:18:26.572
You went up 30 points!

00:18:27.206 --> 00:18:28.207
Yes.

00:18:28.941 --> 00:18:30.642
Congratulations!

00:18:31.844 --> 00:18:32.845
Thank you.

00:18:33.112 --> 00:18:34.980
Now I need to give you the rewards.

00:18:36.548 --> 00:18:40.419
So, if you're up for it,
let's play online together.

00:18:42.387 --> 00:18:43.388
Sure.

00:18:45.057 --> 00:18:46.558
But don't tell anyone else.

00:18:48.961 --> 00:18:49.962
Okay.

00:18:54.533 --> 00:18:55.734
So...

00:18:56.668 --> 00:18:58.804
Can I have your account name?

00:19:01.473 --> 00:19:02.474
Sure.

00:19:05.344 --> 00:19:08.680
The Yudai I loved back then

00:19:10.048 --> 00:19:11.950
had a smile like this

00:19:13.285 --> 00:19:15.888
innocent and completely untainted.

00:19:19.858 --> 00:19:20.859
You can take it.

00:19:22.361 --> 00:19:23.362
Excuse me.

00:19:26.899 --> 00:19:27.900
Hello?

00:19:29.201 --> 00:19:30.736
Yes, what's up?

00:19:31.303 --> 00:19:34.640
Wow, I heard your grades jumped!

00:19:34.706 --> 00:19:35.774
Congratulations!

00:19:36.575 --> 00:19:37.576
Thank you.

00:19:39.211 --> 00:19:40.479
Did Mom tell you?

00:19:41.914 --> 00:19:42.915
That's right.

00:19:43.348 --> 00:19:46.485
Let's celebrate when we meet next.
I made a reservation!

00:19:46.785 --> 00:19:48.687
Wait, you reserved a place already?

00:19:50.289 --> 00:19:51.356
That's a bit much!

00:19:52.658 --> 00:19:54.126
I'm at cram school. I got to go.

00:19:59.097 --> 00:20:01.300
- I'm sorry about that.
- Your dad?

00:20:03.936 --> 00:20:04.937
What?

00:20:05.637 --> 00:20:06.838
Who was it from?

00:20:09.675 --> 00:20:10.676
Your dad?

00:20:11.743 --> 00:20:15.180
Please. Tell me the truth.

00:20:16.782 --> 00:20:18.350
Your dad.

00:20:19.484 --> 00:20:20.485
Who is your dad?

00:20:23.322 --> 00:20:26.725
These 17 years
Yudai and I spent together.

00:20:28.060 --> 00:20:29.061
And you?

00:20:30.062 --> 00:20:31.330
What's your life been like?

00:20:33.165 --> 00:20:34.166
He is...

00:20:39.538 --> 00:20:40.539
not my dad.

00:20:42.174 --> 00:20:43.709
He's someone I've known

00:20:44.977 --> 00:20:46.778
for a long time, like a dad.

00:20:48.180 --> 00:20:49.881
Not a real dad?

00:20:51.817 --> 00:20:53.018
My dad

00:20:54.786 --> 00:20:56.722
left before I was born.

00:20:59.391 --> 00:21:00.759
My mom never told me

00:21:01.893 --> 00:21:03.462
anything about him.

00:21:09.868 --> 00:21:10.869
Wataru!

00:21:12.771 --> 00:21:13.805
Hey, there!

00:21:15.974 --> 00:21:19.344
Wataru, this is my friend.

00:21:19.745 --> 00:21:23.081
Can I make a castle
with you and your mom?

00:21:23.548 --> 00:21:27.185
- Sure.
- Great! Let's make a huge castle!

00:21:27.552 --> 00:21:29.888
How huge?

00:21:30.322 --> 00:21:32.157
Let me see.

00:21:32.724 --> 00:21:36.528
So big that
the three of us can fit in.

00:21:38.730 --> 00:21:39.731
Let's make it.

00:21:40.732 --> 00:21:42.768
After hanging out a few times

00:21:44.369 --> 00:21:46.738
I realized he was my mom's boyfriend.

00:21:48.540 --> 00:21:50.542
When she was busy with work

00:21:52.077 --> 00:21:54.780
he acted like a dad
and played with me.

00:21:55.947 --> 00:21:57.316
So I wasn't lonely.

00:22:02.487 --> 00:22:03.689
He was always

00:22:05.657 --> 00:22:07.292
taking care of me.

00:22:08.860 --> 00:22:10.729
Not a real dad.

00:22:12.831 --> 00:22:14.266
Then why did he...

00:22:15.367 --> 00:22:18.737
I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to talk so much.

00:22:26.478 --> 00:22:27.913
Thank you for telling me.

00:22:29.981 --> 00:22:30.982
By the way

00:22:32.617 --> 00:22:34.019
why do you think...

00:22:38.290 --> 00:22:39.791
Why does he

00:22:41.593 --> 00:22:43.729
never marry your mom?

00:22:49.735 --> 00:22:50.736
Well...

00:22:53.205 --> 00:22:54.806
Excuse me!

00:22:55.607 --> 00:22:58.477
Miyake, the hospital just called.

00:22:59.144 --> 00:23:00.445
Your mom has collapsed.

00:23:05.617 --> 00:23:06.618
Wataru?

00:23:11.556 --> 00:23:12.557
Ms. Kume?

00:23:13.625 --> 00:23:15.594
Did something happen to Wataru?

00:23:16.328 --> 00:23:18.663
Seems like it's a family issue.

00:23:19.865 --> 00:23:20.999
I see.

00:23:22.901 --> 00:23:24.736
Yudai is not

00:23:25.504 --> 00:23:26.938
Wataru Miyake's dad.

00:23:30.976 --> 00:23:31.977
But

00:23:32.844 --> 00:23:34.980
if that woman has collapsed

00:23:36.748 --> 00:23:37.749
what will he do?

00:23:38.950 --> 00:23:39.951
Isn't she pretty?

00:23:40.619 --> 00:23:43.755
I think she's married.

00:23:44.256 --> 00:23:45.891
What? Why?

00:23:46.291 --> 00:23:50.162
Come on, the "marriage"
and "children" sections are blank.

00:23:50.629 --> 00:23:51.730
If she were single

00:23:51.797 --> 00:23:53.565
she'd have filled them in honestly.

00:23:53.965 --> 00:23:55.667
She's here for an affair.

00:23:57.202 --> 00:23:58.370
Right, boss?

00:23:59.070 --> 00:24:03.708
What? Oh, I've never done that,
so I have no idea.

00:24:03.775 --> 00:24:06.912
Boss, you'd totally be popular
on a dating app.

00:24:06.978 --> 00:24:09.114
- No, that's basically cheating.
- Gosh, right.

00:24:10.015 --> 00:24:12.317
Never do that, Chief!

00:24:12.884 --> 00:24:16.588
- Of course I wouldn't!
- Of course not!

00:24:17.923 --> 00:24:19.257
Or maybe you should.

00:24:20.625 --> 00:24:23.295
- What?
- Ms. Matsuzaki?

00:24:23.495 --> 00:24:25.497
What? Ms. Matsuzaki

00:24:25.697 --> 00:24:27.299
are you okay with affairs?

00:24:28.033 --> 00:24:30.535
Well, if the person you fall for

00:24:30.602 --> 00:24:33.338
happens to be married,
it can't be helped.

00:24:34.873 --> 00:24:36.975
Gosh, modern kids these days.

00:24:38.043 --> 00:24:40.846
Chief, say something

00:24:40.912 --> 00:24:42.647
as a model-loving husband!

00:24:44.049 --> 00:24:45.050
Well...

00:24:49.221 --> 00:24:50.455
You have to excuse me.

00:25:00.165 --> 00:25:03.201
I'm sorry, trouble at work.
Don't need dinner.

00:25:11.343 --> 00:25:13.078
Before I knew it, I was running

00:25:15.413 --> 00:25:16.681
even though I might see

00:25:18.116 --> 00:25:20.218
something I wish I didn't.

00:25:23.655 --> 00:25:24.656
Mom!

00:25:25.257 --> 00:25:26.358
Wataru!

00:25:26.892 --> 00:25:29.427
You collapsed? What happened?
Are you okay?

00:25:29.794 --> 00:25:34.232
I'm so sorry.
I scared everyone at work.

00:25:35.000 --> 00:25:36.434
You are not strong.

00:25:37.102 --> 00:25:38.103
Don't push yourself.

00:25:39.237 --> 00:25:40.238
Thank you.

00:25:41.106 --> 00:25:42.774
But I'm okay now.

00:25:51.750 --> 00:25:53.084
And your cram school?

00:25:53.852 --> 00:25:54.853
I finished.

00:25:55.620 --> 00:25:56.621
I see.

00:25:57.489 --> 00:26:01.159
I'm sorry for worrying you
when you need to be studying hard.

00:26:01.726 --> 00:26:02.727
It's okay.

00:26:04.863 --> 00:26:06.097
I'm just happy

00:26:07.365 --> 00:26:10.068
that you seem motivated
for exam prep.

00:26:12.237 --> 00:26:13.238
What?

00:26:14.072 --> 00:26:16.641
I wanted you to study

00:26:16.908 --> 00:26:20.078
get into a college you like,
and learn all kinds of things.

00:26:21.613 --> 00:26:22.714
So I'm happy now.

00:26:23.381 --> 00:26:24.382
Mom.

00:26:28.053 --> 00:26:29.988
That woman has a son, too.

00:26:33.024 --> 00:26:35.460
A son more precious than her life.

00:27:24.242 --> 00:27:25.243
Riko!

00:27:28.713 --> 00:27:29.714
Yudai.

00:27:29.781 --> 00:27:31.549
I'm sorry I made you leave work.

00:27:31.616 --> 00:27:35.420
Don't worry about it.
Your health is more important.

00:27:35.987 --> 00:27:39.524
I'm sorry.
I suddenly felt sick and panicked.

00:27:39.791 --> 00:27:43.628
It's okay.
So, what did the doctor say?

00:27:45.263 --> 00:27:46.264
Yes.

00:27:48.099 --> 00:27:49.134
Well...

00:27:59.411 --> 00:28:00.412
Hello?

00:28:00.879 --> 00:28:03.048
Hello? Ms. Kume?

00:28:03.348 --> 00:28:07.252
Where are the graded quizzes
from the other day?

00:28:07.519 --> 00:28:08.787
I need them quickly.

00:28:10.121 --> 00:28:12.490
They're on my desk.

00:28:14.492 --> 00:28:17.996
Gosh, I'm sorry.
I took the key with me.

00:28:18.430 --> 00:28:19.698
I'll bring it back now.

00:28:40.418 --> 00:28:42.287
Are you still with that woman?

00:28:45.023 --> 00:28:47.058
Do you remember our promise?

00:28:49.461 --> 00:28:50.495
When you get home

00:28:51.730 --> 00:28:53.298
what excuses will you make?

00:29:05.009 --> 00:29:07.712
Do you care more
about that woman's child...

00:29:10.415 --> 00:29:11.950
who isn't related to you

00:29:13.351 --> 00:29:16.154
than our child,
your own flesh and blood?

00:29:21.092 --> 00:29:22.360
I'm sorry, Tsubasa.

00:29:25.196 --> 00:29:26.297
I'm so sorry.

00:29:42.280 --> 00:29:43.581
I'm home.

00:29:47.218 --> 00:29:49.788
Gosh, I'm exhausted.

00:29:50.488 --> 00:29:52.190
What are you doing in the dark?

00:29:59.197 --> 00:30:01.166
I said I wanted to talk tonight.

00:30:02.167 --> 00:30:05.436
I'm sorry.
I really couldn't get away.

00:30:07.806 --> 00:30:10.675
I'll make time again next time.

00:30:14.412 --> 00:30:15.780
Next time? When?

00:30:17.515 --> 00:30:21.519
Like, on my next day off.

00:30:25.690 --> 00:30:26.858
When?

00:30:28.293 --> 00:30:30.995
I said I'm sorry. Don't be so mad.

00:30:31.462 --> 00:30:32.764
I did text you, right?

00:30:34.632 --> 00:30:36.067
You did, but...

00:30:38.536 --> 00:30:40.271
you promised.

00:30:43.274 --> 00:30:45.143
Come on, give me a break.

00:30:45.743 --> 00:30:48.079
It was work.

00:30:55.854 --> 00:30:57.288
It wasn't work.

00:30:59.557 --> 00:31:00.558
What?

00:31:04.395 --> 00:31:05.763
It wasn't work, was it?

00:31:06.898 --> 00:31:08.333
What do you mean?

00:31:10.168 --> 00:31:11.703
I know.

00:31:12.403 --> 00:31:13.404
Know what?

00:31:49.974 --> 00:31:51.376
Where were you today?

00:31:53.144 --> 00:31:54.512
What are you talking about?

00:31:55.747 --> 00:31:57.682
You chose that woman...

00:32:00.285 --> 00:32:02.387
over talking with me.

00:32:02.854 --> 00:32:04.756
What? What woman?

00:32:05.390 --> 00:32:07.926
Finally, I get it.

00:32:11.262 --> 00:32:16.167
I mean nothing to you. Nothing!

00:32:16.401 --> 00:32:18.503
What are you saying, Minori?
That's crazy!

00:32:18.770 --> 00:32:19.771
Liar.

00:32:23.641 --> 00:32:27.512
For 17 years, you've been lying to me

00:32:27.578 --> 00:32:29.314
with a straight face.

00:32:31.649 --> 00:32:32.650
Liar.

00:32:36.721 --> 00:32:38.122
Liar!

00:32:59.744 --> 00:33:01.012
What did you say?

00:33:11.756 --> 00:33:12.757
Nothing.

00:33:16.094 --> 00:33:19.630
I'm really sorry.
I promise I'll make time.

00:33:24.168 --> 00:33:25.169
Minori?

00:33:26.304 --> 00:33:27.338
Are you okay?

00:33:31.676 --> 00:33:32.677
I understand.

00:33:35.646 --> 00:33:37.982
I'm going to take a shower.

00:33:45.623 --> 00:33:47.291
Perhaps...

00:33:49.761 --> 00:33:52.130
we are already too broken...

00:33:55.033 --> 00:33:57.201
to fix.

00:34:07.712 --> 00:34:10.548
My happy home has been shattered

00:34:13.584 --> 00:34:14.819
by you.

00:34:15.887 --> 00:34:18.790
Hey, you're playing Anko Panic again!

00:34:20.391 --> 00:34:22.393
I downloaded it.

00:34:23.694 --> 00:34:25.997
Tell me your account, Wataru.

00:34:26.364 --> 00:34:28.900
I'm sorry, I don't really make
friends online.

00:34:29.801 --> 00:34:31.469
I see. Too bad.

00:34:33.304 --> 00:34:35.840
Hey, how do you level up in this?

00:34:38.109 --> 00:34:39.110
I'm sorry.

00:34:42.046 --> 00:34:43.047
Ms. Kume.

00:34:48.553 --> 00:34:49.587
Miyake.

00:34:50.922 --> 00:34:53.057
I hope your mom was all right.

00:34:53.357 --> 00:34:55.660
She's fine.
I'm sorry about the meeting.

00:34:56.594 --> 00:34:59.897
No problem. I'm glad you
were able to get there right away.

00:35:00.264 --> 00:35:01.732
Thank you for your concern.

00:35:02.767 --> 00:35:03.868
Look

00:35:04.635 --> 00:35:06.737
I'd like your advice on something.

00:35:08.139 --> 00:35:09.507
Do you have time later?

00:35:10.908 --> 00:35:11.909
Sure.

00:35:13.578 --> 00:35:14.579
Absolutely.

00:35:19.350 --> 00:35:20.451
What is it?

00:35:21.719 --> 00:35:25.289
There's a university
I want to aim for.

00:35:27.425 --> 00:35:28.426
I see.

00:35:29.360 --> 00:35:30.495
Which one?

00:35:31.896 --> 00:35:33.798
Keiho University,
Faculty of Education.

00:35:36.334 --> 00:35:37.468
Gosh, that's...

00:35:38.402 --> 00:35:40.838
I want to be like you.

00:35:44.909 --> 00:35:49.180
I mean, I've always been interested
in teaching.

00:35:50.414 --> 00:35:55.553
I feel it can really have
a big impact on someone's life.

00:35:59.123 --> 00:36:00.124
So I...

00:36:01.159 --> 00:36:02.160
I'll do my best.

00:36:04.962 --> 00:36:05.963
Okay.

00:36:07.165 --> 00:36:08.232
I think that's great.

00:36:09.433 --> 00:36:12.403
What did you do before you came here?

00:36:13.671 --> 00:36:14.672
I used to work

00:36:16.040 --> 00:36:17.909
as a university staff member.

00:36:19.277 --> 00:36:20.478
Why did you quit?

00:36:21.212 --> 00:36:24.248
Wants to become a teacher.

00:36:25.750 --> 00:36:26.751
Well...

00:36:38.262 --> 00:36:39.830
Because I got married.

00:36:42.233 --> 00:36:43.234
What?

00:36:48.906 --> 00:36:49.907
You are...

00:36:52.410 --> 00:36:53.411
married?

00:36:55.980 --> 00:36:57.648
I know

00:36:59.617 --> 00:37:02.420
that you have feelings for me.

00:37:05.723 --> 00:37:08.392
Were you shocked that I'm married?

00:37:10.428 --> 00:37:11.429
No.

00:37:13.831 --> 00:37:14.832
I...

00:37:15.933 --> 00:37:18.369
I know it's not your fault.

00:37:19.904 --> 00:37:20.905
But

00:37:21.872 --> 00:37:23.574
I have to do this.

00:37:24.575 --> 00:37:25.810
Just kidding.

00:37:26.677 --> 00:37:28.079
I'm kidding!

00:37:28.913 --> 00:37:29.914
What?

00:37:30.915 --> 00:37:31.916
But

00:37:32.917 --> 00:37:34.685
why did you suddenly decide?

00:37:35.753 --> 00:37:37.588
You're worried about your mom?

00:37:38.656 --> 00:37:39.657
No.

00:37:40.725 --> 00:37:41.726
Actually...

00:37:57.508 --> 00:37:58.509
I...

00:37:59.543 --> 00:38:00.911
I'm going to be a big brother.

00:38:18.296 --> 00:38:19.997
A baby is coming next year.

00:38:24.735 --> 00:38:25.736
What?

00:38:27.505 --> 00:38:29.940
She's pregnant with Yudai's baby.

00:38:30.007 --> 00:38:32.743
You tend to tune out everything
around you.

00:38:32.810 --> 00:38:33.811
Yudai.

00:38:33.878 --> 00:38:35.780
Maybe I'll get a haircut.

00:38:35.846 --> 00:38:38.282
I thought you were in despair.

00:38:38.349 --> 00:38:39.350
I am.

00:38:39.417 --> 00:38:41.585
Your hair really looks good.

00:38:41.819 --> 00:38:43.821
