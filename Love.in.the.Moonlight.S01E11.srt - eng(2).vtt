"Love in the Moonlight"
(Episode 11)

00:01:43.825 --> 00:01:46.785
You need to leave, I need to talk to Prince Inthorn.

00:01:46.985 --> 00:01:49.305
But Prince Kamfah ordered me not to let anyone in.

00:01:49.908 --> 00:01:52.185
He told me to come here.

00:01:55.105 --> 00:01:57.665
This is my palace, Sirichalalai Palace.

00:01:59.025 --> 00:02:00.385
Did you forget about that?

00:02:03.465 --> 00:02:04.466
Leave.

00:02:13.905 --> 00:02:16.665
The photos that you scattered during the reception.

00:02:17.065 --> 00:02:18.066
What are they?

00:02:27.665 --> 00:02:29.405
Too bad we lost power.

00:02:30.545 --> 00:02:31.646
These photos

00:02:32.308 --> 00:02:34.349
- are photos of Sasin and Saenkaew were..
- Hey!

00:02:36.515 --> 00:02:38.545
- What are in the photos?
- Stop!

00:02:42.722 --> 00:02:44.545
I want to talk to him!

00:02:45.265 --> 00:02:47.705
But I don't think you two need to talk.

00:02:49.585 --> 00:02:50.665
You need to leave.

00:02:51.345 --> 00:02:53.545
If Prince Kamfah finds out about this,
he won't be pleasant.

00:03:26.382 --> 00:03:27.383
This way.

00:03:46.682 --> 00:03:48.105
It's all ruined.

00:03:49.025 --> 00:03:51.726
Our well-respected elderly guests
needed to face something like this?

00:03:52.185 --> 00:03:53.825
The journalists will talk about this tomorrow.

00:03:53.985 --> 00:03:55.465
We all will be humiliated.

00:03:57.425 --> 00:03:59.665
You're such a rotten seed, like your mother.

00:04:00.785 --> 00:04:02.145
It was supposed to be a prosperous event,

00:04:02.585 --> 00:04:04.455
instead unlucky things happened!

00:04:08.062 --> 00:04:09.585
What did I do that was so wrong?

00:04:10.145 --> 00:04:12.105
You always blamed it on me.

00:04:12.625 --> 00:04:14.835
- I didn't do anything.
- You didn't do anything?

00:04:15.862 --> 00:04:17.465
This is your wedding.

00:04:18.145 --> 00:04:19.546
Messy things happened on your wedding day.

00:04:20.405 --> 00:04:23.065
I'm so mortified I didn't know where to hide my face.

00:04:23.828 --> 00:04:25.705
If I didn't agree to marry to save Dad,

00:04:25.905 --> 00:04:28.605
you wouldn't even have this palace to hide your face.

00:04:29.935 --> 00:04:30.936
Pin?

00:04:32.025 --> 00:04:35.026
- How dare you talk back to me like this?
- I'm gonna keep talking back to you!

00:04:36.305 --> 00:04:38.585
I never argued.

00:04:39.306 --> 00:04:42.145
I was a good girl, I followed the rules,

00:04:43.488 --> 00:04:46.005
but nobody loved me,

00:04:48.615 --> 00:04:51.625
nobody cared about my feeling.

00:04:54.616 --> 00:04:56.188
What should I do

00:04:57.185 --> 00:04:59.625
to make everyone happy about me?

00:05:02.145 --> 00:05:04.105
This is it, from now on.

00:05:05.225 --> 00:05:07.405
I will live my life the way I've always wanted.

00:05:07.945 --> 00:05:09.665
I don't care

00:05:09.742 --> 00:05:12.225
- if I have to please anyone.
- You're crossing the line!

00:05:13.002 --> 00:05:14.705
What is going on?

00:05:30.582 --> 00:05:31.583
Oh, you poor thing.

00:05:34.475 --> 00:05:36.465
You're worried about him, aren't you?

00:05:38.248 --> 00:05:41.705
There, there, don't cry. He'll come back.

00:05:55.922 --> 00:05:56.923
Sasin!

00:05:57.505 --> 00:05:58.506
Don't hurt him!

00:06:03.265 --> 00:06:04.425
You're still worrying about him?

00:06:06.505 --> 00:06:09.065
You worry about him more than our people?

00:06:09.625 --> 00:06:11.326
That's why you ran away with him.

00:06:11.448 --> 00:06:12.449
Dad!

00:06:12.582 --> 00:06:15.405
I figured out how to save our people
without having to marry Pin.

00:06:16.215 --> 00:06:18.355
Please trust me on this.

00:06:18.785 --> 00:06:19.786
Please, I beg you.

00:06:20.625 --> 00:06:22.026
Let us go.

00:06:22.665 --> 00:06:23.666
Let you go?

00:06:24.505 --> 00:06:27.145
So that you can do horrendous and insane thing

00:06:28.305 --> 00:06:30.665
and ruining our family's reputation like you used to?

00:06:33.202 --> 00:06:34.825
As a father,

00:06:35.995 --> 00:06:37.945
I can't let you do that.

00:06:39.185 --> 00:06:40.985
You still call yourself a father?

00:06:49.202 --> 00:06:50.203
What kind of a father is that?

00:06:51.115 --> 00:06:52.545
You threatened your son.

00:06:54.488 --> 00:06:56.705
You've never cared about his happiness.

00:06:59.015 --> 00:07:00.016
A father?

00:07:00.455 --> 00:07:02.505
You see your son's happiness as something shameful.

00:07:02.588 --> 00:07:03.902
Shut the hell up!

00:07:05.788 --> 00:07:06.789
Saenkaew!

00:07:07.648 --> 00:07:09.745
You don't have to ask for this person's mercy.

00:07:11.585 --> 00:07:12.586
Our love

00:07:13.705 --> 00:07:16.225
doesn't need any approval from anyone

00:07:24.715 --> 00:07:26.345
especially from a selfish guy like him.

00:07:27.705 --> 00:07:29.706
He knows nothing about love!

00:07:30.688 --> 00:07:31.689
Sasin!

00:07:31.862 --> 00:07:32.863
Sasin!

00:07:33.275 --> 00:07:34.276
Sasin!

00:07:35.975 --> 00:07:36.976
Sasin!

00:07:41.322 --> 00:07:42.745
Step back!

00:07:43.855 --> 00:07:44.856
No!

00:07:45.742 --> 00:07:47.465
If you're gonna hurt him,
then you need to hurt me too.

00:07:51.495 --> 00:07:53.368
- You love him that much?
- That's right.

00:07:54.902 --> 00:07:55.903
Saenkaew!

00:07:56.995 --> 00:07:58.585
No! Don't hurt him!

00:08:24.488 --> 00:08:25.665
It's okay.

00:08:26.822 --> 00:08:27.865
I'm right here.

00:08:31.225 --> 00:08:33.305
I won't let anyone hurt you.

00:08:45.362 --> 00:08:46.363
Drag him here!

00:09:08.255 --> 00:09:09.256
Dad!

00:09:09.595 --> 00:09:11.608
Please! No!

00:09:18.545 --> 00:09:19.546
Don't do it!

00:09:21.868 --> 00:09:22.869
Go on!

00:09:24.345 --> 00:09:25.346
Shoot me!

00:09:27.988 --> 00:09:29.065
I'm not afraid of you.

00:09:31.865 --> 00:09:33.545
No matter what you do,

00:09:34.105 --> 00:09:35.585
you can't change the fact that

00:09:36.135 --> 00:09:37.865
we are in love.

00:09:39.342 --> 00:09:40.905
Even if I die and become a ghost,

00:09:41.865 --> 00:09:43.305
I still love him.

00:09:44.555 --> 00:09:45.556
Good.

00:09:46.468 --> 00:09:48.945
Go to hell so this will end!

00:09:50.825 --> 00:09:51.826
Dad!

00:09:54.808 --> 00:09:56.975
- Saenkaew!
- If he dies,

00:09:57.915 --> 00:09:59.265
then I will die too.

00:10:01.428 --> 00:10:02.762
You're willing to die for him?

00:10:04.488 --> 00:10:05.545
Don't!

00:10:14.175 --> 00:10:15.176
Saenkaew! Don't!

00:10:15.782 --> 00:10:16.783
No!

00:10:17.105 --> 00:10:18.106
Stop right now!

00:10:25.865 --> 00:10:27.145
Spare his life,

00:10:28.585 --> 00:10:30.345
and I'll go back to marry Pin.

00:10:31.468 --> 00:10:32.469
No!

00:10:32.508 --> 00:10:33.509
No!

00:10:34.882 --> 00:10:36.145
Let him kill me.

00:10:36.735 --> 00:10:37.825
Kill me.

00:10:39.665 --> 00:10:40.625
Let him kill me.

00:10:43.135 --> 00:10:44.185
But you can't go back.

00:10:45.115 --> 00:10:46.116
Otherwise,

00:10:46.825 --> 00:10:49.585
you will live a miserable life for the rest of your life.

00:10:50.505 --> 00:10:51.506
I know.

00:10:53.182 --> 00:10:54.545
But I can't let you die.

00:10:58.505 --> 00:10:59.506
Dad!

00:11:01.355 --> 00:11:02.756
If you let him go,

00:11:03.388 --> 00:11:04.465
from now on.

00:11:06.345 --> 00:11:08.625
I will follow your orders, everything.

00:11:09.895 --> 00:11:10.896
Fine.

00:11:11.555 --> 00:11:12.825
If you agree to go back with me,

00:11:14.025 --> 00:11:15.145
I'll spare his life.

00:11:15.705 --> 00:11:17.745
No!

00:11:18.865 --> 00:11:19.866
Don't do it!

00:11:38.802 --> 00:11:39.803
Sasin!

00:11:40.822 --> 00:11:41.823
Sasin!

00:11:46.615 --> 00:11:47.616
Hey!

00:11:48.545 --> 00:11:49.546
I'm sorry.

00:11:52.985 --> 00:11:55.505
I'm sorry that I can't keep our promises.

00:12:00.105 --> 00:12:01.665
But I want you to know

00:12:03.305 --> 00:12:04.405
that I love you,

00:12:07.585 --> 00:12:08.586
I love you the most.

00:12:30.145 --> 00:12:31.682
Bring him back to the palace.

00:12:32.588 --> 00:12:33.589
No!

00:12:33.982 --> 00:12:34.888
No! No!

00:12:35.275 --> 00:12:36.545
Don't do it!

00:12:37.015 --> 00:12:38.345
No! No!

00:12:43.928 --> 00:12:44.929
Let me go.

00:12:45.465 --> 00:12:46.466
Let me go!

00:12:49.855 --> 00:12:51.256
- Enough already!
- Sasin!

00:13:39.215 --> 00:13:40.745
Saenkaew!

00:13:41.105 --> 00:13:42.792
What happened to you?

00:13:42.865 --> 00:13:46.625
Whose blood is this? Who hurt you?

00:13:47.975 --> 00:13:50.465
- Who?
- Inthorn's people kidnapped him.

00:13:56.695 --> 00:13:57.865
You poor thing!

00:13:58.342 --> 00:14:00.265
Oh my goodness.

00:14:01.785 --> 00:14:05.065
Why is he so mean and cruel like this?

00:14:06.025 --> 00:14:09.385
I'm glad that you wouldn't get worse than this.

00:14:10.865 --> 00:14:11.866
Are you okay?

00:14:12.342 --> 00:14:13.662
Saenkaew is back

00:14:13.762 --> 00:14:15.265
so I guess bad things will end here.

00:14:20.985 --> 00:14:24.465
My daughter and Saenkaew

00:14:24.822 --> 00:14:27.825
got married officially yesterday.

00:14:28.905 --> 00:14:31.265
You should get the marriage certificate today.

00:14:31.665 --> 00:14:32.625
To make it official.

00:14:58.025 --> 00:14:59.405
Thank you for coming back.

00:15:08.868 --> 00:15:09.869
Nope.

00:15:11.228 --> 00:15:13.065
I should thank your dad instead

00:15:13.705 --> 00:15:14.825
for bringing you back.

00:15:19.668 --> 00:15:21.025
You should be happy to know that

00:15:23.345 --> 00:15:25.505
Sasin will never come near you again.

00:15:29.075 --> 00:15:30.385
Where is he?

00:15:31.105 --> 00:15:32.505
Why did he let you go?

00:15:36.528 --> 00:15:37.705
He is fine.

00:15:39.422 --> 00:15:40.423
He is still alive.

00:15:41.785 --> 00:15:43.405
Because I agreed to come back to you.

00:15:47.835 --> 00:15:48.836
That's why?

00:15:49.625 --> 00:15:51.705
If you hadn't loved and cared for him that much,

00:15:52.105 --> 00:15:53.625
you two could have been gone far far away from here.

00:15:53.762 --> 00:15:55.625
You wouldn't even cared how my life would be.

00:15:55.715 --> 00:15:56.825
Now I am back.

00:15:58.622 --> 00:16:00.265
What more do you want from me?

00:16:03.315 --> 00:16:04.385
I lost.

00:16:06.235 --> 00:16:07.236
I gave up.

00:16:09.468 --> 00:16:11.105
My life is yours,

00:16:12.602 --> 00:16:14.025
from now on.

00:16:44.935 --> 00:16:46.385
You can wake me up normally.

00:16:47.982 --> 00:16:49.865
You son of a bitch!

00:16:50.745 --> 00:16:52.545
You have no dignity and pride.

00:16:53.168 --> 00:16:56.665
You destroyed the wedding of the family for Kalong?

00:16:57.345 --> 00:16:59.305
You didn't bring anything to the table,
yet you destroyed it all.

00:17:03.305 --> 00:17:04.865
Why should I bring anything to the table?

00:17:05.575 --> 00:17:06.576
When the family

00:17:07.025 --> 00:17:08.625
never brings anything to me.

00:17:09.625 --> 00:17:11.805
Our dad gave it all to you.

00:17:13.065 --> 00:17:15.105
If he gave it to you, it would be gone by now.

00:17:16.242 --> 00:17:17.343
You are

00:17:18.362 --> 00:17:19.825
just like rust, attached to the family.

00:17:22.025 --> 00:17:24.025
You're only deteriorating and ruining the family.

00:17:35.865 --> 00:17:37.105
How dare you!

00:17:43.428 --> 00:17:45.405
If I'm a rust, destroying the family,

00:17:45.988 --> 00:17:49.025
what would a homosexual like Saenkaew be compared to?

00:17:50.865 --> 00:17:52.185
How did you raise your son

00:17:52.722 --> 00:17:55.065
to be a homosexual like this?

00:18:02.435 --> 00:18:03.785
I hit you at the right spot, didn't I?

00:18:07.548 --> 00:18:08.825
You got more photos?

00:18:12.568 --> 00:18:14.369
None. They're all gone.

00:18:15.025 --> 00:18:16.665
I scattered them all at the reception.

00:18:18.225 --> 00:18:19.225
And I dropped the negatives

00:18:20.495 --> 00:18:24.185
when I rowed a boat,
trying to get into the reception from the back.

00:18:24.985 --> 00:18:27.185
Please, I have none. If you don't believe me,

00:18:27.705 --> 00:18:28.945
you can search me.

00:18:38.625 --> 00:18:39.426
Nothing.

00:18:42.142 --> 00:18:44.135
Please, don't shoot me.

00:18:45.962 --> 00:18:47.945
- I'm your younger brother.
- A brother?

00:18:50.305 --> 00:18:51.625
You're my brother

00:18:52.225 --> 00:18:54.345
and you acted as if a stray dog.

00:18:55.065 --> 00:18:57.585
You have no pride at all.

00:19:00.025 --> 00:19:01.665
It's my fault.

00:19:02.622 --> 00:19:04.065
I won't do it again.

00:19:05.808 --> 00:19:07.545
Please, I beg you.

00:19:13.162 --> 00:19:14.785
Please, I beg you.

00:19:30.908 --> 00:19:31.909
Get away from here.

00:19:32.428 --> 00:19:34.065
And don't disturb Prince Kamfah again.

00:19:35.335 --> 00:19:36.625
I don't think he will be

00:19:37.585 --> 00:19:39.745
this kind next time.

00:19:40.982 --> 00:19:41.983
Kamsu!

00:19:45.128 --> 00:19:46.585
I'm not afraid of you.

00:19:51.848 --> 00:19:52.849
Where're you going?

00:19:54.185 --> 00:19:55.265
Come back here.

00:20:01.582 --> 00:20:02.583
Honey!

00:20:05.442 --> 00:20:06.665
How are you?

00:20:08.715 --> 00:20:11.585
Why're you looking like this?

00:20:15.495 --> 00:20:16.625
Honey!

00:20:18.615 --> 00:20:20.105
Duangkamol, my baby.

00:20:26.722 --> 00:20:27.723
Where're the negatives?

00:20:28.985 --> 00:20:30.345
You still have it?

00:20:32.028 --> 00:20:33.029
It's right here.

00:20:34.015 --> 00:20:35.016
Honey!

00:20:35.502 --> 00:20:36.503
Get up!

00:20:38.078 --> 00:20:39.105
It's here.

00:20:40.375 --> 00:20:42.025
Why're you so obsessed with it?

00:20:45.455 --> 00:20:48.745
It's not the time to appraise it!

00:20:49.522 --> 00:20:52.405
Should we go?
They could come back at any minute.

00:20:53.288 --> 00:20:54.545
- Should we?
- Let's go.

00:20:55.782 --> 00:20:57.785
Baby, please help me.

00:20:58.415 --> 00:20:59.416
Up! Honey.

00:21:02.035 --> 00:21:03.625
- Are you okay?
- I'm fine.

00:21:07.382 --> 00:21:10.425
Our guys still can't find Inthorn.

00:21:10.928 --> 00:21:13.025
The last time he was seen

00:21:13.545 --> 00:21:15.546
was when he tried to ruin Saenkaew's wedding.

00:21:15.985 --> 00:21:17.105
Then he just disappeared.

00:21:22.425 --> 00:21:23.426
Where is he?

00:21:28.325 --> 00:21:30.225
Send someone to search for him.

00:21:31.585 --> 00:21:32.265
Sir?

00:21:33.305 --> 00:21:34.705
What's the point, sir?

00:21:35.306 --> 00:21:39.107
Saenkaew already got married with a Thai lady.

00:21:39.665 --> 00:21:41.666
They transferred all their assets already.

00:21:42.225 --> 00:21:43.865
I don't think there is anything we can do.

00:21:45.342 --> 00:21:47.785
So finding Inthorn is quite useless.

00:21:51.755 --> 00:21:54.145
You have an important proof to humiliate Kamfah?

00:21:55.402 --> 00:21:57.505
Send it to me, I wanna see it.

00:21:57.945 --> 00:21:58.946
Hurry up.

00:22:05.665 --> 00:22:07.705
Just do what I said.

00:22:09.145 --> 00:22:10.146
Yes, sir.

00:22:18.282 --> 00:22:19.283
This way.

00:22:23.855 --> 00:22:25.985
Easy there.

00:22:28.775 --> 00:22:32.025
I think you get heavier, honey.

00:22:32.742 --> 00:22:34.405
You should rest here.

00:22:34.582 --> 00:22:35.583
Sure.

00:22:38.882 --> 00:22:40.345
Wait for me here.

00:22:40.585 --> 00:22:42.945
I'll call a cap and I'll take you to see a doctor.

00:22:46.442 --> 00:22:47.443
Be careful.

00:23:00.808 --> 00:23:01.809
Prince Inthorn.

00:23:05.628 --> 00:23:06.629
Prince Bodin.

00:23:08.785 --> 00:23:09.786
Give me the negatives.

00:23:14.062 --> 00:23:15.105
You want this?

00:23:18.105 --> 00:23:20.745
I'm not giving it to you, you broke prince.

00:23:22.005 --> 00:23:25.265
I can't let you hurt my daughter.

00:23:25.705 --> 00:23:26.706
Just give me the negatives.

00:23:27.535 --> 00:23:28.745
You want this?

00:23:29.242 --> 00:23:30.345
Then come and get it.

00:23:33.282 --> 00:23:34.665
Duangkamol, my baby.

00:24:33.208 --> 00:24:34.585
Let it go!

00:25:34.302 --> 00:25:35.303
Saenkaew!

00:25:37.035 --> 00:25:38.036
Saenkaew!

00:25:41.936 --> 00:25:43.705
I think you should take some painkillers,

00:25:44.265 --> 00:25:45.266
you're gonna be bruised.

00:25:53.802 --> 00:25:54.803
Where is Saenkaew?

00:25:55.435 --> 00:25:56.436
Where is he?

00:25:56.785 --> 00:25:59.105
- Where is he?
- I don't know.

00:25:59.568 --> 00:26:01.345
I heard someone was at the gate last night.

00:26:01.585 --> 00:26:03.785
I went outside to check and I saw you lying there.

00:26:04.185 --> 00:26:05.305
So I took you in.

00:26:08.282 --> 00:26:10.088
Hey! Where're you going?

00:26:11.208 --> 00:26:13.305
- Move!
- You can't go anywhere!

00:26:13.635 --> 00:26:14.902
- Hey!
- Let me go.

00:26:14.975 --> 00:26:16.442
- Where're you going?
- Let me go! I'm gonna find Saenkaew.

00:26:16.675 --> 00:26:18.865
- You'll be killed if you leave now.
- Hey!

00:26:20.265 --> 00:26:21.385
You need to admit the fact that

00:26:22.225 --> 00:26:23.385
you can't win this.

00:27:57.868 --> 00:27:58.869
This way, doctor.

00:27:59.368 --> 00:28:01.185
My friend has a high fever.

00:28:01.435 --> 00:28:02.665
He's mumbling all the time
and he doesn't respond to me.

00:28:21.705 --> 00:28:24.006
Chiang Mai.

00:28:24.695 --> 00:28:26.005
Grilled chicken!

00:28:26.388 --> 00:28:27.665
You want some grilled chicken?

00:28:28.588 --> 00:28:29.825
Grilled chicken!

00:28:32.622 --> 00:28:33.985
We have grilled meatballs too.

00:28:35.342 --> 00:28:36.343
Grilled chicken!

00:28:45.695 --> 00:28:47.709
I need to see where

00:28:47.745 --> 00:28:49.025
the driver park the car.

00:29:25.168 --> 00:29:26.405
Hello.

00:29:33.745 --> 00:29:36.185
This is Pin-anong. She's Saenkaew's wife.

00:29:36.868 --> 00:29:38.945
She will be your new boss lady.

00:29:43.185 --> 00:29:44.805
Nice to meet you all.

00:29:46.402 --> 00:29:48.025
It will be so nice to work with you all.

00:29:49.505 --> 00:29:53.006
Thank you so much for opening a business here.

00:29:53.585 --> 00:29:55.265
Chansaeng is in chaos right now.

00:29:55.382 --> 00:29:57.185
There're so many officers from Nanta.

00:29:57.848 --> 00:30:00.545
It'd be hard for us if we stayed there.

00:30:02.102 --> 00:30:03.103
That's right.

00:30:06.275 --> 00:30:07.276
I've built this

00:30:08.185 --> 00:30:10.305
timber business for you, Saenkaew.

00:30:14.360 --> 00:30:15.425
From now on,

00:30:16.025 --> 00:30:17.505
Saenkaew and Pin-anong

00:30:18.242 --> 00:30:19.985
will take care of our business.

00:30:20.528 --> 00:30:21.705
We're not leaving you behind.

00:30:25.065 --> 00:30:27.066
We'll start over together.

00:30:27.342 --> 00:30:28.985
- Thank you.
- Thank you so much.

00:30:29.242 --> 00:30:31.265
- Thank you, Prince Saenkaew.
- Thank you.

00:30:31.515 --> 00:30:34.185
- Thank you, Prince Saenkaew.
- Thank you.

00:30:53.425 --> 00:30:54.945
I'll be by your side.

00:30:56.145 --> 00:30:58.305
I'll help you taking care of
our workers and the business.

00:30:59.585 --> 00:31:01.465
About your assets that transferred to me,

00:31:02.265 --> 00:31:03.745
I'll transfer them back

00:31:04.145 --> 00:31:05.705
within three months.

00:31:07.655 --> 00:31:08.805
Totally up to you.

00:31:12.175 --> 00:31:13.176
Well,

00:31:13.625 --> 00:31:15.705
we should explore the city tomorrow.

00:31:16.715 --> 00:31:18.185
It'll give us a chance to greet the elders here.

00:31:20.585 --> 00:31:21.586
Up to you.

00:31:24.375 --> 00:31:25.587
Anything you'd like me to do?

00:31:32.448 --> 00:31:34.945
You're gonna spoil me then?

00:31:35.808 --> 00:31:36.809
That's right.

00:31:38.108 --> 00:31:39.265
I promised my dad

00:31:40.695 --> 00:31:42.025
that I will do anything you want.

00:31:46.382 --> 00:31:48.026
Then fulfill your husband duty.

00:31:49.705 --> 00:31:51.405
We haven't slept together, haven't we?

00:31:52.665 --> 00:31:55.065
We need to be the real husband and wife.

00:33:14.905 --> 00:33:16.585
Why're you like this?

00:33:18.808 --> 00:33:21.985
Why do you make me feel like I'm so disgusting?

00:33:23.405 --> 00:33:24.585
I've never seen you that way.

00:33:24.802 --> 00:33:26.803
But you acted like one.

00:33:29.822 --> 00:33:30.823
I'm sorry.

00:33:36.848 --> 00:33:38.628
That's enough.

00:33:38.805 --> 00:33:40.028
Just tell me.

00:33:40.462 --> 00:33:42.585
What do you want me to be, to think or to do?

00:33:43.505 --> 00:33:44.585
So that I can please you.

00:33:46.122 --> 00:33:47.065
You can just tell me.

00:33:47.945 --> 00:33:50.746
- I will try to do it.
- Why do you have to try?

00:33:52.322 --> 00:33:53.323
Why?

00:33:55.942 --> 00:33:57.745
Can't you just love me?

00:34:00.642 --> 00:34:02.585
I'm so in love with you.

00:34:04.995 --> 00:34:06.825
Can't you just love me?

00:34:13.288 --> 00:34:14.289
I'm sorry.

00:34:19.705 --> 00:34:21.025
Stop apologizing to me.

00:34:24.625 --> 00:34:27.185
I don't want to hear you apologizing anymore.

00:34:32.535 --> 00:34:34.545
I just want you to love me.

00:35:34.388 --> 00:35:35.905
What're you doing here?

00:35:37.025 --> 00:35:39.705
I'm looking for Saenkaew and I need to talk to Pin.

00:35:40.465 --> 00:35:43.105
Nobody is here, they are all in Chiang Mai.

00:35:44.735 --> 00:35:47.305
Only Prince Bodin and Khunying Wad stay here.

00:35:48.185 --> 00:35:50.306
- They're on their honeymoon.
- Nope.

00:35:50.548 --> 00:35:52.345
They moved there, they will never come back.

00:35:53.549 --> 00:35:56.025
I heard that Prince Kamfah opens a business up there.

00:35:56.295 --> 00:35:57.705
You didn't know about this.

00:36:03.785 --> 00:36:06.945
The negative film is all destroyed, and it gets wet.

00:36:07.465 --> 00:36:08.955
I can't develop these for you.

00:36:09.545 --> 00:36:11.025
I need to send them to a lab in Hong Kong

00:36:11.265 --> 00:36:12.266
to work on them.

00:36:12.945 --> 00:36:14.705
Send them to Hong Kong?

00:36:15.305 --> 00:36:16.385
That's right, sir.

00:36:16.745 --> 00:36:18.585
The fee will be so costly.

00:36:18.915 --> 00:36:20.025
It could be up to tens of thousands.

00:36:20.905 --> 00:36:22.625
I don't care how much it costs.

00:36:22.802 --> 00:36:24.465
Just need to see the photos.

00:36:25.182 --> 00:36:26.185
Honey?

00:36:27.145 --> 00:36:28.746
Mr. Kuea took all of the dowry.

00:36:28.985 --> 00:36:30.545
We barely have anything left.

00:36:31.702 --> 00:36:33.865
This is the last amount of cash that we have.

00:36:34.305 --> 00:36:35.465
If we spend it like this,

00:36:36.182 --> 00:36:38.005
we won't have any left for another day.

00:36:38.945 --> 00:36:41.985
These photos will earn us money to spend until we die.

00:36:42.746 --> 00:36:43.825
What do you mean?

00:36:45.305 --> 00:36:46.825
I will show the photos

00:36:47.105 --> 00:36:49.425
of Prince Saenkaew kissing Sasin

00:36:49.625 --> 00:36:50.785
to Pin.

00:36:51.425 --> 00:36:52.665
When she sees these,

00:36:53.145 --> 00:36:55.265
she will ask for a divorce.

00:36:56.025 --> 00:36:58.345
Then all of Prince Kamfah's assets

00:36:58.665 --> 00:37:00.225
will belong to us instead.

00:37:05.008 --> 00:37:06.909
You need to develop these negatives
as soon as possible.

00:37:07.785 --> 00:37:08.886
How much is the deposit?

00:37:37.822 --> 00:37:38.823
Let me go.

00:37:39.055 --> 00:37:40.056
Let me go.

00:37:40.388 --> 00:37:41.945
Where are you going, thief?

00:37:58.322 --> 00:37:59.323
Sasin!

00:38:01.945 --> 00:38:02.946
Saenkaew!

00:38:36.585 --> 00:38:37.886
We can stay here.

00:38:38.385 --> 00:38:40.105
I'll catch fishes.

00:38:41.115 --> 00:38:42.625
I'll climb coconut trees to feed you.

00:38:42.705 --> 00:38:43.945
You should let me feed you.

00:38:45.305 --> 00:38:46.528
You? Feed me?

00:38:46.935 --> 00:38:47.936
Someone like me

00:38:48.545 --> 00:38:50.465
can shoot, ride a horse,

00:38:50.905 --> 00:38:53.006
and go hunting, I've done them all.

00:38:53.225 --> 00:38:54.682
Well, you can feed me

00:38:55.065 --> 00:38:57.705
and I will play instruments

00:38:58.305 --> 00:39:00.825
and sing for you when you're tired.

00:39:14.508 --> 00:39:16.425
This morning, Gen. Kalong

00:39:16.688 --> 00:39:19.065
and the Prime Minister of Chansaeng

00:39:19.465 --> 00:39:23.105
signed an agreement to hand over Chansaeng to Nanta.

00:39:23.585 --> 00:39:25.825
The high-ranking representatives

00:39:26.105 --> 00:39:29.255
and royal family members
from major cities are witnesses the ceremony.

00:39:30.145 --> 00:39:31.585
In the agreement,

00:39:31.955 --> 00:39:35.305
people of Chansaeng and its resources

00:39:35.422 --> 00:39:38.065
will be controlled by Nanta Republic.

00:39:38.588 --> 00:39:41.625
People are not happy with the announcement
and they go out to protest,

00:39:42.405 --> 00:39:44.505
causing them to fight against officers.

00:39:44.805 --> 00:39:47.625
Many people are injured from this.

00:39:56.715 --> 00:39:57.716
Can you see that?

00:39:59.065 --> 00:40:00.705
What I chose for you

00:40:01.145 --> 00:40:02.505
can save everyone.

00:40:04.415 --> 00:40:06.025
If you refused to marry Pin-anong,

00:40:06.905 --> 00:40:07.906
I think

00:40:08.425 --> 00:40:10.826
we would be like people there trying to survive.

00:40:15.375 --> 00:40:16.376
Can you see

00:40:17.402 --> 00:40:19.405
how significant your duty is?

00:40:20.782 --> 00:40:21.945
Saenkaew?

00:40:28.442 --> 00:40:31.265
What you said isn't entirely accurate.

00:40:31.705 --> 00:40:35.945
Their marriage is more than just a duty.

00:40:36.405 --> 00:40:39.875
But they are actually in love.

00:40:40.935 --> 00:40:42.265
Am I right, Pin?

00:40:46.495 --> 00:40:48.625
Can I wait in the car?

00:40:58.348 --> 00:41:00.705
Are you two fighting?

00:41:02.595 --> 00:41:03.596
We're not.

00:41:04.902 --> 00:41:06.305
I think I should go.

00:41:06.908 --> 00:41:08.385
I don't want to be late for monk's lunch.

00:41:20.625 --> 00:41:21.905
Honey?

00:41:29.195 --> 00:41:31.015
Where're you, honey?

00:41:35.348 --> 00:41:36.625
Honey?

00:41:38.895 --> 00:41:40.896
Are you inside?

00:41:43.295 --> 00:41:44.805
Honey?

00:41:51.822 --> 00:41:52.705
I'm finding my husband.

00:41:52.905 --> 00:41:54.922
You're a crazy person, how did you get in here?

00:41:54.968 --> 00:41:57.305
- Get out!
- I'm not crazy, who's crazy?

00:41:57.505 --> 00:41:59.105
- I'm not crazy, I'm finding my husband!
- Get out!

00:41:59.135 --> 00:41:59.948
Honey?

00:42:02.088 --> 00:42:02.889
Get out!

00:42:02.915 --> 00:42:06.065
- I need help! A crazy lady is here. Get out!
- Help me!

00:42:06.105 --> 00:42:07.745
- Honey!
- Get out!

00:42:10.335 --> 00:42:12.105
Honey? Help me!

00:42:35.142 --> 00:42:38.265
How was it? Did you share some good deeds with me?

00:42:46.555 --> 00:42:47.556
Saenkaew!

00:42:52.705 --> 00:42:53.706
Saenkaew!

00:42:59.185 --> 00:43:00.186
Saenkaew!

00:43:00.582 --> 00:43:01.465
Sasin?

00:43:02.465 --> 00:43:03.745
How did he get here?

00:43:05.705 --> 00:43:06.706
Saenkaew!

00:43:07.465 --> 00:43:09.005
I'm right here.

00:43:18.602 --> 00:43:19.603
Saenkaew?

00:43:24.768 --> 00:43:26.145
I'm handling this.

00:43:52.745 --> 00:43:53.746
Saenkaew.

00:44:03.775 --> 00:44:04.776
What're you doing here?

00:44:06.905 --> 00:44:07.985
I'm here to pick you up.

00:44:09.105 --> 00:44:10.106
Please come with me.

00:44:10.905 --> 00:44:11.805
Let's run away together.

00:44:12.805 --> 00:44:14.006
Ms. Rachawadee will help us.

00:44:15.265 --> 00:44:17.665
We can run to Hua Hin and stay in the island.

00:44:19.102 --> 00:44:20.185
You will catch fishes

00:44:21.008 --> 00:44:22.825
and I'll play music for you.

00:44:27.025 --> 00:44:28.545
Do you remember what we talked about?

00:44:29.405 --> 00:44:30.425
It's too late.

00:44:31.142 --> 00:44:32.345
Everything is changed.

00:44:33.625 --> 00:44:35.065
Nothing is changed.

00:44:36.695 --> 00:44:38.225
I still love you

00:44:39.408 --> 00:44:41.335
and I know that you still love me.

00:44:42.508 --> 00:44:43.545
There is no use in this.

00:44:46.328 --> 00:44:47.585
There is no place for

00:44:48.705 --> 00:44:50.406
our love in this world.

00:44:53.095 --> 00:44:54.505
It will hurt you.

00:44:56.062 --> 00:44:57.945
I can't let you die.

00:44:58.545 --> 00:45:01.705
I'm willing to die, I just want to be by your side.

00:45:03.305 --> 00:45:05.145
But you can let me die?

00:45:07.248 --> 00:45:10.145
What're you talking about?
I won't let anything happen to you.

00:45:10.785 --> 00:45:12.305
I won't let anyone hurt you.

00:45:12.835 --> 00:45:14.465
I will protect you.

00:45:20.865 --> 00:45:22.065
But if you die,

00:45:23.265 --> 00:45:24.865
how can I live?

00:45:27.785 --> 00:45:28.886
We can't win in this game.

00:45:30.225 --> 00:45:31.305
Please go.

00:45:32.148 --> 00:45:33.148
No!

00:45:34.015 --> 00:45:35.105
Don't give up.

00:45:35.342 --> 00:45:37.505
- I won't give up.
- Please.

00:45:39.425 --> 00:45:40.625
Don't come back here.

00:45:41.865 --> 00:45:44.266
Don't let me waste what I have done.

00:45:47.235 --> 00:45:49.065
This is the best option.

00:45:51.108 --> 00:45:52.109
At least,

00:45:53.915 --> 00:45:55.785
we both are still alive.

00:45:58.238 --> 00:46:00.988
We can still meet in memories.

00:46:06.415 --> 00:46:07.416
Please, I beg you.

00:46:07.865 --> 00:46:09.585
- Saenkaew?
- If possible,

00:46:11.602 --> 00:46:13.105
please forget about me.

00:46:14.105 --> 00:46:15.625
Forget what happened between us.

00:46:17.505 --> 00:46:19.405
I ask you to start over.

00:46:22.308 --> 00:46:23.425
Living your life without me.

00:46:27.545 --> 00:46:29.705
And you won't suffer because of me again.

00:46:34.742 --> 00:46:35.743
Saenkaew?

00:46:40.608 --> 00:46:42.205
But I love you.

00:46:45.295 --> 00:46:46.405
I love you.

00:46:52.342 --> 00:46:53.425
Please, I beg you.

00:46:55.265 --> 00:46:56.266
I beg of you.

00:46:58.208 --> 00:46:59.265
Goodbye, Sasin.

00:47:05.075 --> 00:47:06.076
Saenkaew!

00:47:06.402 --> 00:47:07.825
Please come back here, Saenkaew!

00:47:09.215 --> 00:47:10.665
I beg you, Saenkaew!

00:47:11.248 --> 00:47:12.249
Saenkaew!

00:47:13.568 --> 00:47:14.569
Saenkaew!
