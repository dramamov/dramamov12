WEBVTT

00:00:10.176 --> 00:00:11.177
Sorry.

00:00:40.407 --> 00:00:44.677
That day, you brought in
a homemade bomb

00:00:45.745 --> 00:00:48.782
hoping to carry out a suicide attack
that would take others with you.

00:00:56.423 --> 00:00:58.658
However, the bomb failed to detonate.

00:01:01.461 --> 00:01:03.363
So you decided to switch tactics.

00:01:04.731 --> 00:01:08.068
You waited for Shibutani Yusuke,
your target, to stand up.

00:01:08.168 --> 00:01:09.769
Then, you approached him
from behind...

00:01:20.146 --> 00:01:21.581
and stabbed him in the back.

00:01:29.322 --> 00:01:31.891
The knife you prepared
slipped between his ribs

00:01:31.991 --> 00:01:33.460
and reached his heart.

00:01:34.527 --> 00:01:36.396
He died within minutes.

00:01:44.337 --> 00:01:47.373
I won't say
what you did was meaningless.

00:01:49.042 --> 00:01:51.978
But, it's also true that
society hasn't changed one bit.

00:01:55.482 --> 00:01:56.883
Or maybe it has?

00:02:00.286 --> 00:02:03.356
Because you are young and beautiful

00:02:04.424 --> 00:02:06.726
a fan club has formed for you
outside the prison walls.

00:02:10.263 --> 00:02:11.664
Humiliating, isn't it?

00:02:11.764 --> 00:02:13.600
I get it. But that's the reality.

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:18.404
It's the very society
you wanted to change.

00:02:18.872 --> 00:02:20.907
A shallow and thoughtless society.

00:02:21.007 --> 00:02:22.008
Shut up.

00:02:22.108 --> 00:02:24.711
Whether it's stabbing a plastic bag
with an umbrella in the subway

00:02:24.811 --> 00:02:27.413
or crashing a plane
into a building and killing thousands

00:02:27.514 --> 00:02:29.682
these events never changed the world.

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:33.086
So, why did you think
killing just one person

00:02:33.153 --> 00:02:35.688
would be enough to change society?

00:02:35.788 --> 00:02:37.423
Don't compare me to those people!

00:02:37.524 --> 00:02:39.325
Even they had
their own sense of justice.

00:02:39.425 --> 00:02:41.494
They believed a better world
lay beyond their actions.

00:02:41.594 --> 00:02:42.695
How are you any different?

00:02:42.829 --> 00:02:44.297
Can you explain that logically?

00:02:47.433 --> 00:02:48.902
– I...
– Time's up.

00:02:50.803 --> 00:02:55.708
Don't misunderstand me.
I'm not here to judge you.

00:02:57.510 --> 00:02:59.712
I just think I understand

00:03:01.247 --> 00:03:03.116
how lonely your battle
must have been.

00:03:06.286 --> 00:03:07.287
Leave.

00:03:08.121 --> 00:03:09.455
You won't be able to forget.

00:03:11.758 --> 00:03:13.693
The face of the person you killed.

00:03:19.966 --> 00:03:20.967
I'll be back.

00:03:32.345 --> 00:03:33.346
What's wrong?

00:03:53.566 --> 00:03:59.572
MR. MIKAMI'S CLASSROOM

00:03:59.706 --> 00:04:02.041
– Good morning!
– Good morning!

00:04:05.178 --> 00:04:06.913
Mr. Mikami is taking a half-day today

00:04:07.046 --> 00:04:08.648
so I'll be leading homeroom.

00:04:08.748 --> 00:04:09.749
What?

00:04:10.950 --> 00:04:13.820
Ms. Koreeda, what did Kanzaki do?

00:04:15.288 --> 00:04:18.024
I haven't heard directly
from him yet, so today...

00:04:18.124 --> 00:04:21.461
Why is the school
ignoring this situation?

00:04:22.595 --> 00:04:24.530
If you mean the reporters,
we've strongly protested.

00:04:24.697 --> 00:04:27.734
No, I mean Mr. Mikami.

00:04:29.335 --> 00:04:30.670
This doesn't make sense.

00:04:31.437 --> 00:04:33.973
After all this chaos,
we're just supposed to focus?

00:04:34.073 --> 00:04:35.341
Just drop it, Sakurai.

00:04:36.976 --> 00:04:37.977
But...

00:04:40.880 --> 00:04:43.116
Everyone's complaining in private

00:04:43.783 --> 00:04:46.753
yet they make you
stand up and say it.

00:04:47.053 --> 00:04:48.054
Isn't that unfair?

00:04:52.091 --> 00:04:53.092
Sakurai, sit down.

00:04:58.398 --> 00:05:01.034
I'm sure you're aware that
I'm aiming for an art university.

00:05:01.868 --> 00:05:05.271
Before I play the violin,
I shut out all distractions.

00:05:06.105 --> 00:05:09.375
I need pure, beautiful concentration.

00:05:12.712 --> 00:05:16.382
I think all of us are
at that moment right now.

00:05:17.016 --> 00:05:22.255
Well, I know people say
the real world is full of noise.

00:05:23.589 --> 00:05:26.993
But I think it's just cruel to
tell us to accept that now.

00:05:30.330 --> 00:05:31.831
That's true.

00:05:34.634 --> 00:05:35.635
Yes.

00:05:38.204 --> 00:05:39.872
I'll tell Mr. Mikami.

00:05:40.440 --> 00:05:43.042
So please wait.

00:05:50.149 --> 00:05:51.150
Ms. Saejima.

00:05:52.385 --> 00:05:54.320
I thought I told you
not to come here anymore.

00:05:56.589 --> 00:05:59.325
The media found out about
your relationship with Yuzuru.

00:06:00.126 --> 00:06:01.127
What?

00:06:01.594 --> 00:06:03.663
They also discovered
you used to teach at Rintoku.

00:06:05.965 --> 00:06:09.035
They might have even found
your current workplace.

00:06:15.475 --> 00:06:17.343
I'll give you an address.

00:06:17.410 --> 00:06:20.046
Meet me there in an hour.

00:06:21.848 --> 00:06:22.849
Is that okay?

00:06:24.417 --> 00:06:26.586
Or would you prefer
we talk at a family restaurant?

00:06:28.354 --> 00:06:29.555
That's out of the question, isn't it?

00:06:31.858 --> 00:06:34.827
– Mr. Mikami.
– What's going on?

00:06:35.294 --> 00:06:37.663
Kanzaki confronted the director.

00:06:37.930 --> 00:06:40.166
He asked why the female teacher
was forced to resign.

00:06:41.200 --> 00:06:43.603
And then he disappeared.

00:06:46.172 --> 00:06:47.206
Have you heard from him?

00:06:48.274 --> 00:06:49.275
No.

00:06:51.978 --> 00:06:55.381
You didn't instigate him,
did you, Mr. Mikami?

00:06:55.481 --> 00:06:56.983
I don't recall doing so.

00:06:57.083 --> 00:06:59.485
If that's more bureaucratic
double-speak, I've had enough.

00:06:59.752 --> 00:07:03.489
Regardless, when he comes to school,
please have a proper talk with him.

00:07:04.457 --> 00:07:05.458
Understood.

00:07:17.703 --> 00:07:21.407
Is it true you turned down
the transfer to Rintoku Seminar?

00:07:22.542 --> 00:07:26.646
Even if it's just a cram school,
I don't think I deserve to teach.

00:07:28.114 --> 00:07:31.551
But, Mr. Tsutsui continues
teaching like nothing happened.

00:07:32.518 --> 00:07:35.354
If he can do it, then fine.

00:07:40.960 --> 00:07:44.831
But you couldn't.

00:07:48.267 --> 00:07:52.939
I thought it was time to
sever ties with the name "Rintoku."

00:07:57.310 --> 00:07:59.812
Something happened to
make you feel that way, right?

00:08:02.682 --> 00:08:07.153
Kanzaki, you really should stop.

00:08:11.457 --> 00:08:12.825
I can't do that.

00:08:16.062 --> 00:08:18.264
You have a long life ahead of you.

00:08:21.601 --> 00:08:22.869
That's exactly why.

00:08:24.537 --> 00:08:29.575
Because it's long, I have to
think about it properly now.

00:08:32.411 --> 00:08:37.850
I need to understand
the meaning of what I've done.

00:08:41.854 --> 00:08:45.758
Was the affair something you wanted?

00:08:48.394 --> 00:08:50.162
Or was there a reason behind it?

00:08:50.596 --> 00:08:52.532
My husband was physically abusive.

00:08:52.598 --> 00:08:54.100
I had nowhere else to go.

00:08:54.734 --> 00:08:56.135
That's all.

00:08:56.903 --> 00:08:57.904
That's a lie.

00:08:59.405 --> 00:09:00.406
Leave.

00:09:00.907 --> 00:09:02.108
Please answer!

00:09:02.675 --> 00:09:05.111
If I published a false article,
I have a duty to correct it.

00:09:05.211 --> 00:09:06.412
It wasn't false.

00:09:06.479 --> 00:09:08.548
So there's no need for a correction.

00:09:31.837 --> 00:09:33.506
I understand Oguri's opinion.

00:09:33.606 --> 00:09:36.642
But it would be irresponsible to
promise that level of concentration.

00:09:36.742 --> 00:09:37.743
But...

00:09:37.843 --> 00:09:40.446
Ignoring what happened
is even more dangerous.

00:09:41.714 --> 00:09:43.082
Especially for Kanzaki.

00:09:45.985 --> 00:09:48.054
You understand why, don't you?

00:09:50.690 --> 00:09:53.259
Because it's a matter
of life and death.

00:09:56.228 --> 00:09:59.198
Are you afraid Kanzaki
will be the next victim?

00:10:02.234 --> 00:10:05.338
I feel ashamed of
my own lack of imagination.

00:10:06.038 --> 00:10:08.841
I tried to think about
how Kanzaki must be feeling

00:10:08.941 --> 00:10:10.810
if even I'm feeling this way.

00:10:13.646 --> 00:10:15.581
Of course, he's deeply hurt.

00:10:18.484 --> 00:10:23.022
But the longer we avoid it,
the deeper the wound becomes.

00:10:24.824 --> 00:10:27.727
That's why he has to
find the answer himself.

00:10:30.229 --> 00:10:32.365
He has to understand
what he's struggling against.

00:10:34.500 --> 00:10:35.968
Both the questions and answers

00:10:37.336 --> 00:10:38.938
are something only he can find.

00:10:54.286 --> 00:10:56.555
A gossip magazine journalist
sent this.

00:10:56.822 --> 00:10:58.424
A student from Mikami's class

00:10:58.524 --> 00:11:01.327
is snooping around
that female teacher.

00:11:01.527 --> 00:11:03.262
They're asking
if they could publish it.

00:11:03.596 --> 00:11:07.299
His father is a political journalist
at Toto Newspaper, after all.

00:11:07.466 --> 00:11:12.004
Yeah, he's a pain to have
as an enemy.

00:11:16.108 --> 00:11:17.276
Should we stop them?

00:11:18.411 --> 00:11:19.412
Yes.

00:11:20.780 --> 00:11:21.781
That'd be nice.

00:11:42.835 --> 00:11:45.371
Kanzaki, do you have anything to say?

00:11:48.507 --> 00:11:50.276
If you have questions,
I'll answer them.

00:11:51.711 --> 00:11:53.679
What's with
the condescending attitude?

00:11:53.779 --> 00:11:56.782
Hey. Relax, Fuyuki.

00:11:57.583 --> 00:12:01.387
Kanzaki said
he'll answer any questions.

00:12:01.721 --> 00:12:03.255
So just ask like you normally would.

00:12:04.657 --> 00:12:06.392
Right, Kanzaki?

00:12:10.496 --> 00:12:11.664
I want to ask something.

00:12:19.371 --> 00:12:21.040
It's fine. Go on.

00:12:22.174 --> 00:12:24.410
Okay. Go ahead, Kurayoshi.

00:12:28.114 --> 00:12:29.281
Kanzaki.

00:12:30.516 --> 00:12:33.619
You said you wanted to
uncover the truth about the vultures.

00:12:34.153 --> 00:12:38.290
Did that mean
confronting the chairman directly?

00:12:43.395 --> 00:12:45.064
– Yeah.
– Wait, but...

00:12:45.164 --> 00:12:48.667
Fuyuki, it's my turn right now.

00:12:50.770 --> 00:12:54.039
What did you ask the chairman,
and how did he respond?

00:12:58.978 --> 00:13:01.614
I asked why Ms. Saejima
was forced to resign.

00:13:03.616 --> 00:13:05.117
He said she quit on her own.

00:13:06.285 --> 00:13:09.889
And you thought
that sounded like a lie?

00:13:15.327 --> 00:13:16.328
Yeah.

00:13:16.695 --> 00:13:17.696
Come on!

00:13:17.797 --> 00:13:20.065
Hey, I just said that
it's my turn right now.

00:13:22.902 --> 00:13:24.069
What's your basis for that?

00:13:25.004 --> 00:13:26.038
I'm still investigating.

00:13:26.272 --> 00:13:27.273
I see.

00:13:29.308 --> 00:13:30.676
All right.

00:13:31.510 --> 00:13:35.781
I've always wondered
why only Ms. Saejima had to leave.

00:13:36.282 --> 00:13:38.584
So I'll continue to ponder over it.

00:13:39.552 --> 00:13:42.755
But I'll also trust
and wait for you, Kanzaki.

00:13:47.993 --> 00:13:49.528
Well...

00:13:51.630 --> 00:13:52.731
And that ends my turn.

00:13:54.233 --> 00:13:57.570
Does anyone else
have any thoughts?

00:14:09.014 --> 00:14:10.416
Now, let's start class.

00:14:11.317 --> 00:14:13.886
Today, we're on page 67.

00:14:16.288 --> 00:14:19.525
This is the kind of question that
will backfire on you

00:14:20.226 --> 00:14:21.894
if you assume the answer
from the start.

00:14:24.196 --> 00:14:25.898
That's the end of class.

00:14:26.098 --> 00:14:27.099
Thank you.

00:14:33.873 --> 00:14:34.907
Mr. Mikami.

00:14:34.974 --> 00:14:37.910
Why don't you stop students
from going off-topic during class?

00:14:38.010 --> 00:14:39.712
– Off-topic?
– I mean Kurayoshi...

00:14:39.812 --> 00:14:42.281
Hey, why don't you ask her directly?

00:14:42.381 --> 00:14:45.851
I'm not saying she's wrong.
So it has nothing to do with her.

00:14:49.054 --> 00:14:50.923
I'm a returnee student.

00:14:51.891 --> 00:14:54.360
What? Does that matter?

00:14:54.460 --> 00:14:55.661
In America

00:14:55.728 --> 00:14:59.565
students are often made to
express their opinions in class.

00:14:59.832 --> 00:15:01.500
High schoolers
even have debate classes.

00:15:01.600 --> 00:15:03.135
That's not what I'm talking about!

00:15:03.235 --> 00:15:06.305
Just listen first.

00:15:07.973 --> 00:15:09.808
We were taught that in discussions

00:15:09.875 --> 00:15:12.378
it's important to listen to the end.

00:15:15.147 --> 00:15:19.018
That's what I kept saying
even after coming back to Japan.

00:15:20.819 --> 00:15:23.022
But that doesn't work here.

00:15:24.423 --> 00:15:28.093
If you don't keep
your thoughts to yourself

00:15:28.827 --> 00:15:31.330
people will see you as someone
who can't read the room.

00:15:31.397 --> 00:15:34.800
This country values the distinction
between public and private thoughts.

00:15:34.867 --> 00:15:36.201
I learnt that the hard way.

00:15:38.837 --> 00:15:40.306
And it scared me.

00:15:43.008 --> 00:15:47.346
Kurayoshi,
I didn't know you felt that way.

00:15:50.115 --> 00:15:55.754
That's why I developed
the habit of swallowing my words

00:15:56.889 --> 00:15:58.590
when something is
really important to me.

00:15:59.658 --> 00:16:01.560
And I started hating myself for it.

00:16:02.995 --> 00:16:04.063
But...

00:16:06.632 --> 00:16:12.504
I wanted to hear
what Kanzaki had to say.

00:16:18.844 --> 00:16:20.212
Forget it.

00:16:20.746 --> 00:16:21.880
Do whatever you want.

00:16:23.048 --> 00:16:24.049
Sakurai...

00:16:57.449 --> 00:16:59.451
What was that exchange?

00:16:59.718 --> 00:17:00.719
Too cute.

00:17:02.121 --> 00:17:06.725
Kurayoshi, I've actually been
wanting to try debating for a while.

00:17:07.259 --> 00:17:08.260
Teach me.

00:17:08.827 --> 00:17:12.698
You split into opposing and
supporting sides, right?

00:17:14.266 --> 00:17:16.168
Yeah, that's right.

00:17:17.569 --> 00:17:20.439
How do you decide
the winner in a debate?

00:17:21.340 --> 00:17:23.976
The judges determine the outcome.

00:17:30.649 --> 00:17:32.184
Are you okay, Sakurai?

00:17:38.757 --> 00:17:40.459
Everyone must be thinking...

00:17:42.628 --> 00:17:46.632
"Sakurai, who do you think you are
with those grades?"

00:17:47.566 --> 00:17:50.002
Really? You think so?

00:17:52.538 --> 00:17:55.441
In the end, this school
is all about grades.

00:17:56.475 --> 00:17:59.845
Yeah, everyone's desperate.

00:18:00.079 --> 00:18:01.847
They just don't show it.

00:18:08.921 --> 00:18:10.823
I feel so stupid.

00:18:13.992 --> 00:18:15.294
Why would you say that?

00:18:16.595 --> 00:18:18.697
You work harder than anyone.

00:18:18.831 --> 00:18:20.399
You have every right to be confident.

00:18:43.055 --> 00:18:44.056
Sorry for the wait.

00:18:44.156 --> 00:18:46.091
Just a sec.
I'll take care of this real quick.

00:18:47.960 --> 00:18:48.994
Done!

00:18:49.728 --> 00:18:52.498
– Wow.
– All right, let's go.

00:18:54.933 --> 00:19:01.907
Shinonome

00:19:09.014 --> 00:19:10.349
Sorry, let's head home.

00:19:10.549 --> 00:19:11.550
Hold on.

00:19:11.650 --> 00:19:14.219
– What?
– It's open.

00:19:32.437 --> 00:19:33.639
Excuse me.

00:19:35.140 --> 00:19:36.341
Are you all right?

00:19:37.042 --> 00:19:38.076
Dad?

00:19:39.978 --> 00:19:42.347
Chiba West General Hospital

00:19:54.159 --> 00:19:55.160
Wait...

00:19:55.961 --> 00:19:56.962
Why are they here?

00:19:58.764 --> 00:20:03.635
Shinonome told me she wanted to
talk to her divorced father

00:20:04.002 --> 00:20:05.070
so I accompanied her.

00:20:07.072 --> 00:20:09.074
I told you that
you didn't have to come with me.

00:20:09.741 --> 00:20:12.611
Well, your mom's
not going to come, is she?

00:20:15.347 --> 00:20:18.250
So I made the decision to call you.

00:20:18.750 --> 00:20:21.019
Good call. Thanks.

00:20:22.821 --> 00:20:25.357
Tazune's family situation
is complicated.

00:20:26.325 --> 00:20:29.261
She really wants to
keep up with the class

00:20:29.428 --> 00:20:31.163
now that things are moving forward.

00:20:31.863 --> 00:20:34.733
But, she's completely against Okami.

00:20:36.735 --> 00:20:38.804
Is that why you left her behind?

00:20:40.072 --> 00:20:43.008
I thought she should
talk things out with Okami.

00:20:49.548 --> 00:20:50.549
Want some bread?

00:20:52.284 --> 00:20:53.518
No, thanks.

00:20:55.254 --> 00:20:58.123
Ms. Koreeda insisted on buying it.

00:20:58.824 --> 00:21:01.460
I thought, "Why is she thinking
about food at a time like this?"

00:21:02.094 --> 00:21:04.229
But she said,
"She must be hungry."

00:21:09.801 --> 00:21:13.438
If you're bored, you should
eat it yourself, Mr. Mikami.

00:21:18.010 --> 00:21:21.613
Or just go home.

00:21:33.925 --> 00:21:35.627
Takuto, got a minute?

00:21:48.774 --> 00:21:50.842
If you keep getting involved
in this case

00:21:51.310 --> 00:21:52.644
they said they'd publish it.

00:21:57.883 --> 00:22:01.053
I don't care.

00:22:03.622 --> 00:22:06.291
Do you understand how it feels
to be the one being photographed?

00:22:12.197 --> 00:22:14.266
Mr. Mikami is a Criminal!

00:22:15.267 --> 00:22:18.837
Are you having fun
playing journalist?

00:22:46.698 --> 00:22:49.968
Tazune: I'm going to talk
during homeroom tomorrow.

00:22:55.040 --> 00:22:56.908
Okay!

00:23:04.416 --> 00:23:06.518
Starting next week,
parent-teacher conferences

00:23:06.618 --> 00:23:08.153
will be conducted remotely.

00:23:08.820 --> 00:23:11.289
Please have your parents enter
their availability into the system.

00:23:12.157 --> 00:23:15.494
If there are no questions,
this concludes homeroom.

00:23:22.534 --> 00:23:25.637
Do you know what these are?

00:23:27.773 --> 00:23:28.807
Japanese Language Secret Manual

00:23:28.874 --> 00:23:31.076
These are textbooks
your father made, right?

00:23:32.944 --> 00:23:34.613
So you knew,
and you pretended not to?

00:23:34.713 --> 00:23:36.381
I wasn't pretending.

00:23:39.284 --> 00:23:43.688
Mr. Mikami, don't you have
some responsibility in this?

00:23:44.790 --> 00:23:45.791
Why?

00:23:59.704 --> 00:24:03.508
Yesterday, my father collapsed.

00:24:03.708 --> 00:24:04.709
What?

00:24:06.411 --> 00:24:09.781
Tominaga was with me and saved him.

00:24:11.316 --> 00:24:15.220
If he had been found any later,
he wouldn't have made it.

00:24:18.490 --> 00:24:23.028
My father was
a middle school teacher.

00:24:24.863 --> 00:24:26.264
I used the past tense

00:24:27.466 --> 00:24:29.000
because he isn't one anymore.

00:24:36.074 --> 00:24:40.111
He got caught
using his own teaching materials.

00:24:41.279 --> 00:24:42.447
The Ministry of Education

00:24:42.514 --> 00:24:45.350
charged him with
violating curriculum guidelines.

00:24:45.450 --> 00:24:46.451
That's right.

00:24:49.187 --> 00:24:52.524
Wait, using one's own materials is
against the rules?

00:24:53.391 --> 00:24:55.794
Don't you use them, Ms. Koreeda?

00:24:55.894 --> 00:24:57.662
What? Well...

00:24:57.762 --> 00:24:59.931
It's fine as long as
it's supplementary.

00:25:00.565 --> 00:25:02.834
But in Japanese schools,
during compulsory education

00:25:02.934 --> 00:25:06.238
they must use textbooks that passed
the government's screening process.

00:25:07.639 --> 00:25:10.242
Well, many private schools
don't strictly follow that rule.

00:25:10.809 --> 00:25:14.079
What?
What's textbook screening?

00:25:14.179 --> 00:25:16.314
If a textbook doesn't pass
the screening, it can't be used.

00:25:16.414 --> 00:25:17.749
So private textbooks aren't allowed.

00:25:17.916 --> 00:25:19.985
I see. Really?

00:25:20.485 --> 00:25:23.822
But, Shinonome's father
did not use any approved textbooks.

00:25:23.922 --> 00:25:25.757
He only used his own materials.

00:25:25.857 --> 00:25:27.993
Wow, none at all?

00:25:28.059 --> 00:25:29.628
Yeah, that might be a problem.

00:25:29.928 --> 00:25:33.231
But still, how could they
fire a teacher over that?

00:25:38.737 --> 00:25:40.272
When the issue was discovered

00:25:43.108 --> 00:25:44.509
he was warned multiple times.

00:25:45.577 --> 00:25:48.046
But even after repeated warnings,
he refused to stop.

00:25:49.014 --> 00:25:51.082
So in the end, he wasn't
allowed to teach anymore.

00:25:52.384 --> 00:25:55.320
And eventually,
he resigned voluntarily.

00:25:56.621 --> 00:25:58.623
But that's not really
the Ministry's fault, is it?

00:25:58.723 --> 00:25:59.791
Why not?

00:25:59.858 --> 00:26:02.661
My parents got divorced
because of that.

00:26:03.395 --> 00:26:05.730
– Shinonome, let's calm down--
– Mr. Mikami.

00:26:05.797 --> 00:26:08.133
Have you ever thought about this?

00:26:08.533 --> 00:26:10.135
That the rules set by
the Ministry of Education

00:26:10.235 --> 00:26:12.137
can tear families apart?

00:26:14.005 --> 00:26:16.608
No... Not really.

00:26:17.976 --> 00:26:18.977
What?

00:26:19.077 --> 00:26:22.614
The curriculum guidelines
aren't meant to protect family peace.

00:26:24.983 --> 00:26:27.552
Excuse me, may I say something?

00:26:27.886 --> 00:26:28.887
Of course.

00:26:32.023 --> 00:26:33.458
Yesterday was the first time

00:26:33.525 --> 00:26:38.063
I really learned about
her family situation.

00:26:38.363 --> 00:26:39.364
And?

00:26:39.464 --> 00:26:42.467
Then, I realized
I couldn't say anything without

00:26:42.567 --> 00:26:44.302
understanding the core issue.

00:26:44.803 --> 00:26:47.939
So, I read the middle school
curriculum guidelines.

00:26:48.940 --> 00:26:50.175
So what?

00:26:50.575 --> 00:26:52.243
If you don't know what it is

00:26:52.344 --> 00:26:54.312
you can't judge it,
positively or negatively, right?

00:26:57.682 --> 00:26:58.750
Go ahead.

00:27:10.895 --> 00:27:16.101
First of all, the theme of
the curriculum guidelines

00:27:16.201 --> 00:27:18.169
is "The Zest for Life."

00:27:18.903 --> 00:27:21.172
If you read closely

00:27:22.707 --> 00:27:25.043
they emphasize on
"creativity and ingenuity,"

00:27:25.110 --> 00:27:29.714
"developing thinking judgment,"
"expressive skills"

00:27:31.049 --> 00:27:34.352
and "education that
nurtures individuality."

00:27:36.421 --> 00:27:39.991
So why exactly was
her dad in the wrong?

00:27:41.092 --> 00:27:43.194
The materials he created

00:27:43.695 --> 00:27:46.698
were also designed to develop
"The Zest for Life."

00:27:47.298 --> 00:27:50.635
If anything, I bet using these
to study must have been really fun.

00:27:50.735 --> 00:27:52.303
They're amazing teaching materials.

00:27:54.439 --> 00:27:55.440
So in the end

00:27:56.041 --> 00:28:02.647
the only real issue was that
he failed to fulfill the requirement

00:28:03.515 --> 00:28:05.350
of using
government-approved textbooks.

00:28:08.653 --> 00:28:11.656
Even so, this document
is so confusing.

00:28:13.058 --> 00:28:16.728
Middle school curriculum guidelines
are notoriously hard to understand.

00:28:17.262 --> 00:28:20.632
Even bureaucrats keep saying
it needs to be fixed.

00:28:21.700 --> 00:28:23.768
So, this is a sharp critique.

00:28:23.868 --> 00:28:27.572
But, it doesn't justify
what Shinonome's father did.

00:28:30.942 --> 00:28:32.711
I know that.

00:28:34.546 --> 00:28:35.780
Then, what do you want to do?

00:28:36.981 --> 00:28:37.982
What?

00:28:38.349 --> 00:28:42.487
You brought this up
because you wanted change, right?

00:28:47.492 --> 00:28:49.561
Or did you just want me to apologize?

00:28:55.967 --> 00:28:56.968
Think about it.

00:29:13.785 --> 00:29:15.487
Please give me some time.

00:29:19.390 --> 00:29:20.391
Okay.

00:29:24.863 --> 00:29:26.664
Everyone, let's all
think about it too.

00:29:33.605 --> 00:29:34.939
Tominaga.

00:29:35.006 --> 00:29:37.442
Thanks for the clear explanation.

00:29:39.077 --> 00:29:40.211
Shinonome.

00:29:44.749 --> 00:29:49.020
Your name comes from
the proverb "Onkochishin," right?

00:29:50.455 --> 00:29:53.525
"Learning from the past
to understand the new."

00:29:54.325 --> 00:29:55.760
That's why you're named "Tazune."

00:29:58.129 --> 00:29:59.130
Yes.

00:30:00.565 --> 00:30:02.433
My father gave me that name.

00:30:04.669 --> 00:30:06.771
More like he entrusted you with it.

00:30:10.542 --> 00:30:11.609
Yes.

00:30:15.647 --> 00:30:20.685
And yet, I got so shaken
by my father's collapse

00:30:21.352 --> 00:30:22.687
that I just got angry.

00:30:23.855 --> 00:30:25.757
That's not true.

00:30:26.257 --> 00:30:28.326
I think you raised a great question.

00:30:34.966 --> 00:30:36.067
I...

00:30:38.837 --> 00:30:40.171
I just feel so frustrated.

00:30:41.773 --> 00:30:42.774
I understand.

00:30:49.914 --> 00:30:50.915
It's okay.

00:31:01.626 --> 00:31:03.094
Kanzaki!

00:31:04.062 --> 00:31:06.931
– Want to come over today?
– What? Why?

00:31:07.198 --> 00:31:09.634
Just come.
I got some new information.

00:31:14.005 --> 00:31:16.040
You're gonna be shocked.

00:31:17.642 --> 00:31:19.510
– Ken, welcome home.
– I'm home!

00:31:19.744 --> 00:31:21.312
– Hello.
– Hello.

00:31:23.014 --> 00:31:24.015
Come in.

00:31:32.223 --> 00:31:33.725
– Hello.
– Excuse me.

00:31:52.443 --> 00:31:56.180
– Wow, this is amazing!
– What?

00:31:56.915 --> 00:31:58.950
What is this? This is incredible!

00:31:59.050 --> 00:32:00.818
Why is Tominaga here?

00:32:00.952 --> 00:32:02.921
– Did you build all of this, Jigen?
– Yeah.

00:32:03.087 --> 00:32:06.157
Wow, so your parents
bought everything for you?

00:32:07.225 --> 00:32:11.696
Our school has a lot of kids
from powerful families, right?

00:32:12.196 --> 00:32:14.165
But in my case,
academically speaking

00:32:14.265 --> 00:32:15.566
I was born into a weak family.

00:32:15.733 --> 00:32:19.170
But then, a total anomaly of a genius
suddenly appeared.

00:32:19.270 --> 00:32:24.208
Thus, my folks are pretty loose
with the purse strings.

00:32:24.876 --> 00:32:27.979
Hey, Lupin. Turn on the PC!

00:32:29.147 --> 00:32:30.148
Yes, sir!

00:32:30.882 --> 00:32:32.583
What? What did you just do?

00:32:32.684 --> 00:32:37.322
I built my own voice-recognition AI.

00:32:37.889 --> 00:32:39.357
Since my last name is Tsugimoto

00:32:39.424 --> 00:32:41.526
it's only natural for my nickname
to be Jigen, right?

00:32:41.626 --> 00:32:43.328
That's why your named it Lupin?

00:32:44.696 --> 00:32:46.431
Yes, I am Lupin.

00:32:47.966 --> 00:32:50.501
Hey, Lupin. Yuzuru.

00:32:50.802 --> 00:32:51.803
Okay.

00:32:52.136 --> 00:32:54.672
– What? Who's that?
– Mayama Yuzuru.

00:32:54.772 --> 00:32:55.940
I see.

00:32:56.107 --> 00:32:58.176
By the way,
this widely circulated photo

00:32:58.276 --> 00:32:59.978
is from her middle school yearbook.

00:33:00.578 --> 00:33:01.612
Hey, Lupin.

00:33:01.679 --> 00:33:04.615
Generate an image of her
at 22 years old.

00:33:05.016 --> 00:33:06.017
Understood.

00:33:10.555 --> 00:33:11.556
Wow!

00:33:12.156 --> 00:33:15.293
Lupin, summarize
Mayama Yuzuru's information.

00:33:15.426 --> 00:33:16.427
Processing.

00:33:18.262 --> 00:33:21.599
The cause of her shut-in
was, of course, bullying.

00:33:22.934 --> 00:33:24.369
Her father is Mayama Takafumi.

00:33:24.435 --> 00:33:27.405
He was a high-ranking official in
the prefectural board of education.

00:33:27.472 --> 00:33:31.042
And yet, his daughter
became a shut-in.

00:33:31.142 --> 00:33:34.212
That's all just stuff
you can read in the news.

00:33:34.445 --> 00:33:37.915
Yeah, but this makes it
way more convenient.

00:33:38.349 --> 00:33:39.650
For example...

00:33:40.118 --> 00:33:43.388
Hey, Lupin.
Pull up data on Yuzuru's case.

00:33:44.288 --> 00:33:45.690
Loading.

00:33:48.926 --> 00:33:51.295
Wait, what is all this?
This is insane.

00:33:53.531 --> 00:33:55.099
Hello, this is Mikami.

00:33:56.034 --> 00:33:59.337
About that matter, I was thinking of
handling it tomorrow.

00:34:01.773 --> 00:34:02.774
Yes.

00:34:05.043 --> 00:34:06.044
Got it.

00:34:09.380 --> 00:34:11.682
I want to become a prosecutor.

00:34:12.150 --> 00:34:13.217
Seriously?

00:34:13.818 --> 00:34:16.054
This whole thing is like
my shot at real-world training.

00:34:16.220 --> 00:34:18.289
That's why I started
investigating it.

00:34:18.456 --> 00:34:19.457
Is that right?

00:34:19.557 --> 00:34:21.459
If this is gonna be
a long story, I'm leaving.

00:34:22.927 --> 00:34:26.464
Come on, let me pitch myself first.

00:34:26.531 --> 00:34:27.532
First, there's this.

00:34:28.433 --> 00:34:30.501
And this room.

00:34:30.568 --> 00:34:34.172
You can use it whenever you want.

00:34:34.639 --> 00:34:35.640
I don't need it.

00:34:36.707 --> 00:34:39.577
Then, how about this option?

00:34:39.977 --> 00:34:45.783
I'm so incredibly talented that
I found something shocking.

00:34:45.883 --> 00:34:47.385
What? Show me.

00:34:47.518 --> 00:34:49.520
I'll show you,
if he makes me his assistant.

00:34:49.620 --> 00:34:52.824
Of course Kanzaki will
make you his assistant, Jigen!

00:34:52.924 --> 00:34:54.959
Tominaga, just go home already.

00:34:55.059 --> 00:34:58.830
Sorry, but I'm not leaving
until I see it.

00:35:00.331 --> 00:35:03.835
So, do we have a deal?

00:35:07.038 --> 00:35:08.439
Guess I have no choice.

00:35:08.539 --> 00:35:09.540
All right!

00:35:10.274 --> 00:35:12.543
Now, quiz time!

00:35:12.877 --> 00:35:16.714
What year did
cell phones get cameras?

00:35:16.814 --> 00:35:21.285
What? I think they already
had them when I was born.

00:35:21.385 --> 00:35:24.989
The correct answer is 1999.

00:35:25.089 --> 00:35:29.427
And in 2001,
they became explosively popular

00:35:29.560 --> 00:35:33.397
when photos could be
attached to emails.

00:35:34.098 --> 00:35:37.668
Is this "option" just a deep dive
into mobile device history?

00:35:38.970 --> 00:35:40.872
Patience, my friend.

00:35:41.105 --> 00:35:43.207
Then came 2002.

00:35:43.674 --> 00:35:46.978
Anything significant comes to mind?

00:35:47.078 --> 00:35:50.915
The year after 9/11?

00:35:51.315 --> 00:35:52.416
Not sure.

00:36:01.692 --> 00:36:03.060
Wow...

00:36:03.761 --> 00:36:06.631
If you dig deep enough
into the internet

00:36:06.797 --> 00:36:10.902
you find
crime scene photos like this.

00:36:22.280 --> 00:36:23.281
Mr. Nakaoka?

00:36:24.348 --> 00:36:26.250
Mr. Makino.

00:36:26.984 --> 00:36:28.486
What brings you here at this hour?

00:36:28.819 --> 00:36:30.721
I have a date with
Congressman Fujioka.

00:36:31.055 --> 00:36:33.157
He calls me out
whenever he wants to see me.

00:36:33.357 --> 00:36:34.992
Are you working on tomorrow's
National Diet preparations?

00:36:35.092 --> 00:36:37.395
Yes, since the regular session is
wrapping up.

00:36:37.995 --> 00:36:39.363
A bicycle?

00:36:40.331 --> 00:36:42.833
This is my hotline
between Kasumigaseki and Nagatacho.

00:36:42.934 --> 00:36:44.435
It's the fastest way.

00:36:44.602 --> 00:36:46.504
For delivering government documents

00:36:46.604 --> 00:36:48.406
this is my primary method.

00:36:48.606 --> 00:36:49.941
So analog, isn't it?

00:36:50.308 --> 00:36:53.411
Nagatacho insists on
handing everything in person.

00:36:57.281 --> 00:36:59.984
– Mr. Nakaoka.
– Yes?

00:37:00.218 --> 00:37:02.386
The next time you're free,
can we meet?

00:37:02.520 --> 00:37:03.688
Of course.

00:37:03.888 --> 00:37:06.057
Preferably just the two of us.

00:37:07.158 --> 00:37:09.427
Is this a date?

00:37:10.328 --> 00:37:11.963
I'd love that.

00:37:14.098 --> 00:37:17.034
Let's make it a long-term thing.

00:37:18.102 --> 00:37:19.904
See you soon.

00:37:27.511 --> 00:37:31.349
Man, I lost again!

00:37:31.482 --> 00:37:34.151
– Hey.
– Pardon the intrusion.

00:37:34.352 --> 00:37:35.686
Wasn't there one more person?

00:37:35.786 --> 00:37:37.355
There was, but he left.

00:37:37.822 --> 00:37:39.490
Want to stay for dinner?

00:37:41.025 --> 00:37:42.660
I'm sorry,
but I was just about to go.

00:37:42.827 --> 00:37:46.664
Wait, aren't you from
the Tominaga family?

00:37:46.831 --> 00:37:47.832
What?

00:37:47.932 --> 00:37:50.167
When you were in the first grade

00:37:50.268 --> 00:37:51.669
your mom and I
were in the PTA together.

00:37:51.769 --> 00:37:52.837
Is that so?

00:37:52.970 --> 00:37:56.007
Yeah, the other parents there
were so stuck-up.

00:37:56.240 --> 00:37:58.342
I was so relieved to
have your mom around.

00:37:58.643 --> 00:38:01.279
Stop saying unnecessary things, Mom.

00:38:01.379 --> 00:38:03.648
– Please come visit again.
– Of course.

00:38:05.149 --> 00:38:06.917
Thank you for having me.

00:38:07.018 --> 00:38:08.986
– Of course.
– See you.

00:38:09.220 --> 00:38:11.422
Hey, at least see her off.

00:38:33.010 --> 00:38:34.011
Who is this?

00:38:37.448 --> 00:38:38.749
You already know, don't you?

00:38:39.884 --> 00:38:41.552
I want to hear it from you.

00:38:45.623 --> 00:38:46.891
Twenty-two years ago...

00:38:48.859 --> 00:38:52.530
a boy made an announcement
over the school PA system.

00:38:55.132 --> 00:38:57.034
Then, he took his own life.

00:38:59.637 --> 00:39:02.006
His death was so shocking that
it caused a huge uproar

00:39:03.307 --> 00:39:05.242
with others even following
in his footsteps.

00:39:07.078 --> 00:39:09.714
The boy's name was Kota Mikami.

00:39:13.684 --> 00:39:15.119
He was my older brother.

00:39:19.824 --> 00:39:24.161
You saw it happen
when you were in middle school.

00:39:25.296 --> 00:39:27.998
KEIREI ACADEMY FM

00:39:29.900 --> 00:39:30.901
That's right.

00:39:33.637 --> 00:39:38.209
Why did you come to this school?

00:39:41.445 --> 00:39:44.048
For revenge? Or...

00:39:44.148 --> 00:39:45.316
I can't talk about it yet.

00:40:24.989 --> 00:40:27.792
To Yuzuru

00:40:41.071 --> 00:40:43.040
– Good morning.
– Good morning.

00:40:55.419 --> 00:40:58.088
Excuse me. Are you Mikami Takashi?

00:40:58.189 --> 00:40:59.590
Do you have a moment?

00:41:01.091 --> 00:41:03.127
It's about the article
written for the school newspaper.

00:41:08.332 --> 00:41:11.035
Sorry. We're open for business.
Could you all leave?

00:41:11.135 --> 00:41:13.804
We'll leave
once you answer our questions.

00:41:13.938 --> 00:41:17.107
You're disturbing the customers.
Please just leave.

00:41:17.274 --> 00:41:18.576
When is she coming back?

00:41:19.310 --> 00:41:20.744
We can't work like this.

00:41:22.913 --> 00:41:25.783
Reporters are already showing up
at school into the new year.

00:41:26.016 --> 00:41:28.552
It's making the students uneasy.

00:41:28.853 --> 00:41:33.691
Please be extra careful
not to stir things up further.

00:41:34.058 --> 00:41:35.726
That's all. Thank you.

00:41:36.293 --> 00:41:37.761
Understood.

00:41:42.833 --> 00:41:43.968
Was everything okay?

00:41:44.502 --> 00:41:45.503
What do you mean?

00:41:45.603 --> 00:41:47.271
Well, earlier...

00:41:47.371 --> 00:41:48.772
Did something happen?

00:41:49.306 --> 00:41:51.642
No, it's just...

00:41:52.576 --> 00:41:55.246
Mr. Mikami was
approached by a reporter.

00:41:55.613 --> 00:41:58.082
Is that true, Mr. Mikami?

00:41:58.182 --> 00:41:59.316
Yes.

00:41:59.383 --> 00:42:00.885
They said they've received

00:42:00.951 --> 00:42:02.019
the latest issue of
Kanzaki's newspaper.

00:42:02.119 --> 00:42:03.554
You should have
reported that immediately.

00:42:03.654 --> 00:42:05.155
I was just about to.

00:42:05.256 --> 00:42:08.626
In any case, matters like these
should go through the school.

00:42:09.460 --> 00:42:10.528
I have his business card

00:42:10.661 --> 00:42:13.163
so we can
formally protest if necessary.

00:42:16.267 --> 00:42:18.602
Why does one thing after another
keep happening?

00:42:20.804 --> 00:42:23.040
All right, meeting dismissed.

00:42:23.107 --> 00:42:24.775
Dismissed!

00:42:25.543 --> 00:42:27.411
Why are we being dismissed?

00:42:29.113 --> 00:42:31.015
There are only teachers here, right?

00:42:33.918 --> 00:42:36.520
Is there anyone here who has
nothing to do with this issue?

00:42:36.620 --> 00:42:37.621
You need to stop.

00:42:37.721 --> 00:42:39.557
I've thought this for a while now.

00:42:40.691 --> 00:42:43.861
Teachers are supposed to
set an example for students

00:42:44.695 --> 00:42:47.865
but instead, we just exchange glances
and wait for time to pass.

00:42:50.434 --> 00:42:55.005
This school's motto is
"Self-Discipline," right?

00:42:55.306 --> 00:42:59.209
Do the teachers
not have to follow it?

00:42:59.310 --> 00:43:01.145
– Stop it.
– Is there anyone here

00:43:01.445 --> 00:43:04.348
who can honestly say
they have nothing to do with this?

00:43:04.448 --> 00:43:05.983
I said, stop!

00:43:06.083 --> 00:43:07.985
You can't educate students
while shutting out opinions

00:43:08.085 --> 00:43:09.086
you don't want to hear.

00:43:09.353 --> 00:43:10.487
What did you say?

00:43:11.755 --> 00:43:13.290
Mr. Mizohata, calm down.

00:43:13.390 --> 00:43:14.758
Is there something wrong?

00:43:19.396 --> 00:43:20.998
– Did something happen?
– No, sir.

00:43:21.131 --> 00:43:22.132
Well...

00:43:25.369 --> 00:43:29.607
You weren't being rude to
Mr. Mikami, were you?

00:43:31.475 --> 00:43:33.043
Of course not.

00:43:33.644 --> 00:43:34.645
Actually, this morning

00:43:34.745 --> 00:43:38.349
a magazine reporter
approached Mr. Mikami.

00:43:39.817 --> 00:43:42.920
We were just discussing
how to handle that.

00:43:44.622 --> 00:43:45.623
– Right?
– Yes.

00:43:45.723 --> 00:43:48.659
– Look.
– What is this?

00:43:50.394 --> 00:43:51.395
What's wrong?

00:43:54.164 --> 00:43:57.034
"Rintoku is
the country's blessed land.

00:43:57.935 --> 00:44:02.406
So many have entered this land
through the Hirakawa Gate.

00:44:03.207 --> 00:44:06.310
I see your corruption.

00:44:07.111 --> 00:44:08.779
Signed, Prince Yamato Takeru.

00:44:15.653 --> 00:44:19.223
Someone sure went through
a lot of effort for this prank.

00:44:25.329 --> 00:44:27.097
All right, everyone.

00:44:27.164 --> 00:44:29.066
Back to work.

00:45:41.805 --> 00:45:43.273
Can you hear me?

00:45:43.373 --> 00:45:46.577
Maybe Yamato Takeru
symbolizes bureaucrats.

00:45:46.677 --> 00:45:49.646
I thought Okami was nuts,
but his brother was something else.

00:45:49.747 --> 00:45:52.216
If you believe
only your justice is right

00:45:52.316 --> 00:45:53.517
you won't be able to talk to anyone.

00:45:53.617 --> 00:45:56.086
Then why give
18-year-olds the right to vote?

00:45:56.754 --> 00:45:57.988
Please tell me the truth.

00:45:58.088 --> 00:45:59.323
We got played.

00:45:59.823 --> 00:46:01.925
Still, this is bad, Makino.

00:46:02.025 --> 00:46:03.694
I won't let Mikami
do whatever he wants.

00:46:03.761 --> 00:46:04.862
Is that okay, sir?
