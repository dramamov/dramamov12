WEBVTT

00:00:04.371 --> 00:00:08.808
I planned to live my whole life

00:00:10.043 --> 00:00:12.012
with this man.

00:00:13.046 --> 00:00:18.618
I made a solemn oath that day.

00:00:21.254 --> 00:00:24.491
That happiness turned to regret.

00:00:25.392 --> 00:00:28.028
Regret turned to despair.

00:00:30.730 --> 00:00:31.798
And now...

00:01:51.778 --> 00:01:55.014
PLEASE DIE MY BELOVED

00:02:00.553 --> 00:02:02.155
I can smell the trees.

00:02:04.057 --> 00:02:09.429
It feels out of place,
seeing you in nature like this.

00:02:09.496 --> 00:02:13.099
I've loved the mountain,
even as a kid.

00:02:13.166 --> 00:02:16.736
Really? I never knew that.

00:02:19.105 --> 00:02:20.306
You...

00:02:22.642 --> 00:02:24.944
like the beach more, right?

00:02:25.912 --> 00:02:26.913
Huh?

00:02:29.716 --> 00:02:34.287
I remember you said no
when I invited you a long time ago.

00:02:36.789 --> 00:02:39.826
- A mountain hike?
- Yeah, let's go.

00:02:42.829 --> 00:02:46.232
I'll pass. It sounds tough.

00:02:46.299 --> 00:02:49.569
Don't worry, it's not that steep.

00:02:49.636 --> 00:02:52.172
Let's go to the beach instead, okay?

00:02:55.708 --> 00:02:56.910
But...

00:02:57.644 --> 00:03:00.813
I really wanted to
come here with you, Maya.

00:03:04.384 --> 00:03:09.389
I'm happy.
My dream finally came true.

00:03:28.241 --> 00:03:29.242
Yurika.

00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:31.811
You...

00:03:31.878 --> 00:03:34.380
Please leave. I'll call the police.

00:03:36.950 --> 00:03:38.885
Why are you here?

00:03:38.952 --> 00:03:40.019
Yurika.

00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:42.488
Those terms are too much.

00:03:43.523 --> 00:03:46.693
You know I can't afford that much.

00:03:47.927 --> 00:03:49.295
You can't?

00:03:50.897 --> 00:03:53.633
I'll have to take you to court then

00:03:53.700 --> 00:03:55.034
for assault.

00:03:55.535 --> 00:03:57.704
What? You can't.

00:03:58.504 --> 00:03:59.906
Please, rethink this.

00:04:08.615 --> 00:04:10.550
Stop. Yuna's here.

00:04:12.051 --> 00:04:13.052
Please.

00:04:18.992 --> 00:04:21.561
I don't understand you.

00:04:23.596 --> 00:04:27.100
I don't get any joy
from seeing you grovel like this.

00:04:29.636 --> 00:04:32.171
You could never win
anyone's approval.

00:04:32.238 --> 00:04:35.008
Your whole life,
nothing went your way.

00:04:37.443 --> 00:04:40.146
So when you found someone
who'd obey you

00:04:41.981 --> 00:04:44.250
did that fix your self-esteem?

00:04:46.319 --> 00:04:47.320
Sorry.

00:04:49.255 --> 00:04:50.390
I'm sorry.

00:04:57.430 --> 00:05:03.036
Didn't you love me,
even for just a moment?

00:05:06.406 --> 00:05:11.511
Didn't you want to cherish me?

00:05:13.646 --> 00:05:15.381
So why...

00:05:24.857 --> 00:05:26.959
Don't ever show your face here again.

00:05:33.399 --> 00:05:35.268
Yurika, I'm sorry.

00:05:35.335 --> 00:05:37.203
Let me actually apologize.

00:05:37.870 --> 00:05:40.106
And I'm sorry to Yuna too.

00:05:40.173 --> 00:05:42.742
Sorry, please, Yurika...

00:05:56.022 --> 00:05:58.124
You can't even provide for yourself.

00:06:08.267 --> 00:06:11.904
"The bear suddenly shouted out

00:06:12.772 --> 00:06:16.676
'Oh, let's go visit someone today!'"

00:06:18.111 --> 00:06:20.012
- Hey, Mommy?
- Yes?

00:06:21.047 --> 00:06:24.217
Nice Daddy was good at reading to me.

00:06:32.425 --> 00:06:33.760
Nice Daddy...

00:06:35.661 --> 00:06:37.230
is gone now.

00:06:40.733 --> 00:06:42.068
He's gone.

00:07:07.794 --> 00:07:09.195
Riko!

00:07:19.539 --> 00:07:20.706
Just one last time.

00:07:21.774 --> 00:07:22.909
Let me see you off.

00:07:25.812 --> 00:07:28.014
- Your new address--
- Not telling you.

00:07:28.080 --> 00:07:30.516
- Your phone number?
- Don't call me.

00:07:30.583 --> 00:07:32.318
- Email?
- Don't email me.

00:07:33.052 --> 00:07:34.854
- When it's born, can you--
- Sorry.

00:07:36.355 --> 00:07:37.390
Go home.

00:07:40.359 --> 00:07:42.128
I have to go alone now.

00:07:44.764 --> 00:07:47.033
Heart rate is falling.

00:07:49.268 --> 00:07:50.503
Riko, watch out!

00:07:58.511 --> 00:08:00.680
What? Hiroki!

00:08:04.116 --> 00:08:05.785
I'm sorry!

00:08:05.852 --> 00:08:08.955
Riko!

00:08:09.021 --> 00:08:10.289
Are you okay?

00:08:10.356 --> 00:08:11.991
Are you hurt?

00:08:12.058 --> 00:08:13.059
Huh?

00:08:14.093 --> 00:08:15.094
How's your belly?

00:08:16.295 --> 00:08:17.296
And the baby?

00:08:19.198 --> 00:08:20.333
We're fine.

00:08:23.269 --> 00:08:24.270
Thank God.

00:08:25.638 --> 00:08:26.839
Thank God!

00:08:34.080 --> 00:08:35.948
Oh, sorry.

00:08:37.750 --> 00:08:39.485
- Go on.
- Huh?

00:08:40.553 --> 00:08:44.257
Seeing me like this
isn't good for the baby.

00:08:47.493 --> 00:08:48.494
Take care.

00:08:50.930 --> 00:08:51.964
Huh?

00:08:54.400 --> 00:08:56.903
- Call the ambulance!
- Just go!

00:09:01.774 --> 00:09:02.775
Promise me

00:09:04.810 --> 00:09:06.646
you and the baby will be happy.

00:09:23.529 --> 00:09:24.530
Wait.

00:09:25.932 --> 00:09:27.099
Hiroki.

00:09:31.671 --> 00:09:33.773
You won't track my location anymore?

00:09:35.408 --> 00:09:36.576
Huh?

00:09:36.642 --> 00:09:40.346
You won't look at my phone anymore?

00:09:43.282 --> 00:09:44.350
Riko...

00:09:47.053 --> 00:09:49.021
You won't handcuff me?

00:09:49.088 --> 00:09:50.623
That might be tough.

00:09:51.724 --> 00:09:54.260
- Then...
- No, I promise!

00:09:59.231 --> 00:10:00.800
Let's live together.

00:10:02.335 --> 00:10:03.369
The three of us.

00:10:09.041 --> 00:10:12.111
But I'm not afraid to get
the divorce papers out again.

00:10:12.178 --> 00:10:13.212
Okay.

00:10:13.279 --> 00:10:16.015
- Is your leg okay?
- Yeah.

00:10:16.082 --> 00:10:18.284
No, it doesn't look okay.

00:10:18.351 --> 00:10:20.119
- May you two find happiness.
- Yeah.

00:10:20.186 --> 00:10:21.887
- Which is it?
- Yeah.

00:10:24.824 --> 00:10:26.592
This looks delicious.

00:10:26.659 --> 00:10:29.362
- Let's eat.
- Let's eat.

00:10:39.772 --> 00:10:43.242
I haven't had
your omelets in a while.

00:10:44.143 --> 00:10:45.144
What?

00:10:45.645 --> 00:10:47.713
Before we got married

00:10:47.780 --> 00:10:50.349
we planned
a picnic at the local park.

00:10:51.017 --> 00:10:53.119
But it started raining, remember?

00:10:58.324 --> 00:11:00.826
That's unlucky.
It was sunny this morning.

00:11:01.827 --> 00:11:03.929
It's just one of those days.

00:11:05.598 --> 00:11:07.833
Wanna grab lunch somewhere?

00:11:07.900 --> 00:11:08.934
What?

00:11:09.568 --> 00:11:11.937
Let's eat the lunch you packed.

00:11:15.341 --> 00:11:16.342
Hmm?

00:11:17.043 --> 00:11:18.477
Oh, sorry.

00:11:18.544 --> 00:11:20.913
I made it how I usually like it.

00:11:22.448 --> 00:11:24.784
I like it this way too.
You didn't know?

00:11:27.853 --> 00:11:29.722
Omelets with mayo.

00:11:32.491 --> 00:11:36.595
We're a pretty odd couple, huh?

00:11:37.229 --> 00:11:38.464
Are we?

00:11:38.531 --> 00:11:40.299
Yeah, I mean

00:11:40.366 --> 00:11:43.102
you usually season
omelets with salt or pepper.

00:11:44.403 --> 00:11:45.571
Oh, right.

00:11:55.448 --> 00:11:56.582
Hey.

00:11:58.317 --> 00:12:01.587
Since we're both pretty odd...

00:12:06.726 --> 00:12:08.027
Let's get married.

00:12:15.668 --> 00:12:20.172
Since we both seem to like
omelets with mayo.

00:12:25.644 --> 00:12:27.580
Wait, hold on there.

00:12:27.646 --> 00:12:30.316
We're getting married
because of mayo?

00:12:30.382 --> 00:12:33.085
- Can't we?
- Well, I'm not saying we can't.

00:12:33.152 --> 00:12:36.021
But you're proposing on a rainy day?

00:12:36.088 --> 00:12:37.423
It's too sudden.

00:12:43.596 --> 00:12:46.165
But I kinda like the rain.

00:12:48.601 --> 00:12:52.004
Everyone always says
they love the sun.

00:12:52.071 --> 00:12:53.873
I feel bad for the rain.

00:13:05.718 --> 00:13:06.886
Yes, then.

00:13:07.753 --> 00:13:08.954
Yes to what?

00:13:09.722 --> 00:13:11.157
The proposal!

00:13:11.223 --> 00:13:13.692
Oh, we're a married couple then.

00:13:13.759 --> 00:13:16.328
- No, I changed my mind.
- Why? I'm sorry.

00:13:22.802 --> 00:13:23.803
Delicious.

00:13:28.407 --> 00:13:30.643
Doing okay, Maya?

00:13:30.709 --> 00:13:31.844
Yeah.

00:13:35.281 --> 00:13:37.850
- Hey, Mitsuhiro.
- Yeah?

00:13:37.917 --> 00:13:42.688
You're always holding in
what you want to say to me, right?

00:13:42.755 --> 00:13:43.889
What?

00:13:44.657 --> 00:13:45.991
How about you tell me?

00:13:47.693 --> 00:13:51.997
It might help distract you
from being scared.

00:13:54.900 --> 00:13:58.170
Then can you say
what's on your mind too?

00:13:59.171 --> 00:14:00.339
What?

00:14:00.406 --> 00:14:03.843
If I'm telling you my complaints,
you tell me yours.

00:14:10.382 --> 00:14:11.483
For me...

00:14:12.785 --> 00:14:15.020
- Your socks.
- Huh?

00:14:16.488 --> 00:14:20.492
I don't like how you leave
your socks balled up on the ground.

00:14:23.195 --> 00:14:25.564
Oh, sorry.

00:14:27.867 --> 00:14:29.835
It's your turn. Say something.

00:14:31.370 --> 00:14:35.975
For me, it's how you always
tidy up right away.

00:14:37.509 --> 00:14:38.510
What?

00:14:39.011 --> 00:14:43.716
You even try to throw away
important mail without asking.

00:14:55.060 --> 00:14:57.396
Oh, right. Sorry.

00:14:57.463 --> 00:14:59.098
My coffee too.

00:14:59.164 --> 00:15:03.002
You clear it away
when I'm still drinking it.

00:15:04.904 --> 00:15:07.606
It's because
you don't tidy up yourself.

00:15:08.374 --> 00:15:09.375
What?

00:15:09.441 --> 00:15:11.343
When your refill the toilet paper

00:15:11.410 --> 00:15:14.146
I hate how you leave the empty roll.

00:15:14.213 --> 00:15:16.348
- That's...
- When you do that

00:15:16.415 --> 00:15:19.351
it's because someone else
does it for you, right?

00:15:19.418 --> 00:15:25.090
But I'm the only one around,
so I tidy up whenever I can.

00:15:25.157 --> 00:15:27.159
You could've told me.

00:15:27.226 --> 00:15:29.061
I did, over and over.

00:15:29.128 --> 00:15:34.533
But I always look like the bad guy,
so I just gave up.

00:15:34.600 --> 00:15:36.869
That's on you.

00:15:36.936 --> 00:15:39.972
You always give off a bad vibe
when something bothers you.

00:15:40.039 --> 00:15:41.173
What?

00:15:41.240 --> 00:15:43.475
You sigh instead of just saying it.

00:15:43.542 --> 00:15:45.244
Or give me a dirty look.

00:15:45.311 --> 00:15:48.180
Just acting upset won't fix anything.

00:15:48.247 --> 00:15:49.481
You gotta say it.

00:15:49.548 --> 00:15:52.051
I wanted to, but I couldn't.

00:15:52.117 --> 00:15:54.320
Since you acted so dismissive.

00:15:54.386 --> 00:15:56.188
- I didn't.
- You did.

00:15:56.255 --> 00:15:58.924
You're the one who was dismissive.

00:15:58.991 --> 00:16:00.826
- No.
- Yes.

00:16:00.893 --> 00:16:03.595
Like when I wanted a baby.

00:16:06.432 --> 00:16:07.433
Sorry.

00:16:09.535 --> 00:16:10.636
Never mind.

00:16:13.105 --> 00:16:14.406
Let's just drop it.

00:16:42.001 --> 00:16:44.570
About the baby thing...

00:16:45.738 --> 00:16:48.507
Sorry, I didn't mean
to bring that up.

00:16:50.342 --> 00:16:51.343
No...

00:16:53.212 --> 00:16:54.580
I'm sorry.

00:16:55.347 --> 00:16:56.348
Huh?

00:16:58.317 --> 00:16:59.752
I regret it.

00:17:02.855 --> 00:17:05.224
You don't want a kid with me?

00:17:07.426 --> 00:17:08.594
I do.

00:17:09.261 --> 00:17:11.163
But not yet.

00:17:13.265 --> 00:17:14.967
For wording it like that

00:17:17.236 --> 00:17:20.139
and not wanting to talk about it.

00:17:25.044 --> 00:17:27.079
Do you still want a baby?

00:17:33.719 --> 00:17:34.920
What about you?

00:17:42.027 --> 00:17:43.362
I don't know.

00:17:45.297 --> 00:17:51.370
But if we had one,
I wonder how life would be now.

00:17:55.541 --> 00:17:56.775
If we had one...

00:18:07.086 --> 00:18:09.388
It's hard to imagine.

00:18:09.455 --> 00:18:10.923
I agree.

00:18:11.824 --> 00:18:13.892
Maybe it was better off this way.

00:18:13.959 --> 00:18:15.461
You might be right.

00:18:16.261 --> 00:18:18.363
- Maybe.
- Probably.

00:19:56.495 --> 00:19:57.529
Mitsuhiro?

00:20:04.203 --> 00:20:05.470
Good morning, Maya.

00:20:11.677 --> 00:20:13.545
I want to show you something.

00:20:26.225 --> 00:20:30.195
We haven't talked this much
in a while.

00:20:31.630 --> 00:20:32.731
Yeah.

00:20:34.433 --> 00:20:40.105
Before this, I didn't know
how you felt, Mitsuhiro.

00:20:41.807 --> 00:20:42.808
Me neither.

00:20:43.775 --> 00:20:45.777
Even after living together.

00:20:48.647 --> 00:20:51.450
Is there anything else
you haven't said yet?

00:20:53.485 --> 00:20:54.486
No.

00:20:55.587 --> 00:20:57.222
I said my part.

00:20:59.391 --> 00:21:04.129
Do you think we can go back
to how things used to be?

00:21:08.033 --> 00:21:09.268
I'd like that.

00:21:24.049 --> 00:21:25.250
So pretty.

00:21:29.454 --> 00:21:30.589
Maya.

00:21:34.559 --> 00:21:35.894
I love you.

00:22:08.794 --> 00:22:11.430
And that's why I can't do this.

00:22:12.264 --> 00:22:13.832
I can't forgive you.

00:22:16.034 --> 00:22:18.904
That you of all people

00:22:19.971 --> 00:22:22.240
would tell me to die!

00:22:23.642 --> 00:22:25.043
If only...

00:22:27.746 --> 00:22:30.115
If only you'd just die!

00:22:34.786 --> 00:22:36.021
Hey.

00:22:36.888 --> 00:22:39.491
We promised to spend
our lives together.

00:22:39.558 --> 00:22:41.626
So why did you say that?

00:22:42.794 --> 00:22:45.030
I love you, so I can't forgive you.

00:22:45.097 --> 00:22:47.499
Why, Maya?

00:22:47.566 --> 00:22:51.470
I love you,
so why would you tell me to die?

00:22:51.536 --> 00:22:54.940
Do you know how that feels,
from your own wife?

00:22:55.874 --> 00:23:00.278
Is that how you really feel, Maya?

00:23:00.846 --> 00:23:03.014
Well?

00:23:37.249 --> 00:23:38.517
It hurts...

00:25:14.412 --> 00:25:15.447
Maya...

00:25:55.820 --> 00:25:56.988
Maya...

00:26:47.706 --> 00:26:48.773
Ms. Komoto.

00:26:53.778 --> 00:26:54.946
Detective.

00:26:57.916 --> 00:27:00.151
My condolences.

00:27:06.725 --> 00:27:08.793
I'm sorry about your husband.

00:27:10.261 --> 00:27:12.464
Just after he came back too.

00:27:14.966 --> 00:27:15.967
Yes.

00:27:20.872 --> 00:27:23.508
Did you do it?

00:27:26.544 --> 00:27:27.646
What?

00:27:31.983 --> 00:27:34.986
Did you kill your husband?

00:27:42.494 --> 00:27:43.628
No.

00:30:39.504 --> 00:30:40.972
I'm hungry.

00:30:46.678 --> 00:30:48.279
Yeah, me too.

00:30:52.550 --> 00:30:53.852
We should eat.

00:31:29.420 --> 00:31:30.421
My beloved.

00:31:32.790 --> 00:31:35.960
The one I swore my life to.

00:31:40.198 --> 00:31:42.200
The one I chose

00:31:43.935 --> 00:31:45.370
out of billions of people.

00:31:52.043 --> 00:31:54.679
I wished we understood each other

00:31:56.314 --> 00:31:59.017
but it wasn't meant to be.

00:32:01.052 --> 00:32:04.756
I wanted to let you go,
but I couldn't.

00:32:06.958 --> 00:32:08.593
We grew entangled

00:32:08.660 --> 00:32:11.296
and couldn't help
but hurt each other.

00:32:12.597 --> 00:32:13.798
And yet...

00:32:15.867 --> 00:32:19.971
And yet, this feeling
that remains for you...

00:32:20.972 --> 00:32:24.509
Will we one day call it love?

00:32:30.081 --> 00:32:31.215
My beloved.

00:32:50.068 --> 00:32:51.169
So much space.

00:32:56.007 --> 00:32:59.377
There have been reports of a stabbing
incident at an apartment in Kyoto.

00:32:59.877 --> 00:33:03.081
The wife, Emi Senda,
was arrested by police

00:33:03.147 --> 00:33:05.116
on suspicion of homicide.

00:33:06.117 --> 00:33:10.021
Around 7 p.m.
on the 29th of last month

00:33:10.088 --> 00:33:14.859
Emi Senda is thought to have stabbed
her husband's back multiple times

00:33:14.926 --> 00:33:17.328
and is now in custody
for suspected homicide.

00:33:17.996 --> 00:33:20.798
During the police's investigation

00:33:21.532 --> 00:33:26.070
she testified that she often
wished to kill her husband

00:33:26.137 --> 00:33:28.373
admitting to the crime.

00:33:28.439 --> 00:33:29.474
"I OFTEN WANTED TO KILL HIM"

00:33:29.540 --> 00:33:32.643
It seems the locals
thought they got along well.

00:33:32.710 --> 00:33:36.481
Well, they say 20% of homicides
happen between spouses.

00:33:36.547 --> 00:33:40.051
Wow, that's scary.

00:33:40.118 --> 00:33:41.219
This is...

00:33:42.286 --> 00:33:44.022
your story.

00:33:45.790 --> 00:33:47.458
- Handkerchief?
- Check!

00:33:47.525 --> 00:33:49.594
- And your lunch?
- Got it.

00:33:52.063 --> 00:33:53.431
I'm going now.

00:33:53.498 --> 00:33:55.333
Okay, me too.

00:33:56.100 --> 00:33:57.869
- Thanks, Mom.
- Mm-hmm.

00:34:02.707 --> 00:34:03.708
Mommy!

00:34:04.342 --> 00:34:06.511
Good luck at work today!

00:34:09.047 --> 00:34:10.214
Thanks!

00:34:14.018 --> 00:34:16.888
Being rowdy again, huh?

00:34:21.793 --> 00:34:23.594
- I'm back.
- Welcome home.

00:34:24.228 --> 00:34:25.930
Back from the hospital already?

00:34:27.532 --> 00:34:29.901
Do you know if it's a boy or girl?

00:34:31.502 --> 00:34:33.104
Which is it?

00:34:35.873 --> 00:34:36.874
Ta-da.

00:34:40.111 --> 00:34:42.914
My husband's away on work.

00:34:42.980 --> 00:34:44.916
Really? How long?

00:34:44.982 --> 00:34:46.417
A week.

00:34:46.484 --> 00:34:49.120
- I'm jealous.
- Well, not mine.

00:34:49.187 --> 00:34:51.989
After he retired,
he just lazes around all day.

00:34:52.056 --> 00:34:53.825
The misunderstandings

00:34:55.293 --> 00:34:56.294
and resentment

00:34:58.329 --> 00:35:00.398
make all the wives grumble

00:35:05.036 --> 00:35:08.306
"Please die, my beloved."

00:35:13.478 --> 00:35:14.745
Ready?

00:35:14.812 --> 00:35:16.747
We survived another day!

00:35:16.814 --> 00:35:17.982
Cheers!

00:35:19.484 --> 00:35:23.087
Well, hot pot season is finally here.

00:35:23.154 --> 00:35:25.123
It's getting chilly.

00:35:25.189 --> 00:35:27.024
Time flies, huh?

00:35:27.091 --> 00:35:28.392
I know, right?

00:35:28.459 --> 00:35:31.162
Every year feels faster.

00:35:31.229 --> 00:35:32.530
Maybe it's our age.

00:35:33.731 --> 00:35:35.666
It's been a busy year.

00:35:36.767 --> 00:35:37.768
We've been...

00:35:41.005 --> 00:35:42.006
through a lot.

00:35:50.381 --> 00:35:51.449
Hey.

00:35:52.750 --> 00:35:54.085
Are you happy now?

00:35:56.721 --> 00:36:00.925
Do you think we've found happiness?

00:36:07.798 --> 00:36:11.068
We're going to find it.

00:36:14.739 --> 00:36:15.740
Right?

00:36:18.876 --> 00:36:19.877
Yeah.

00:36:21.979 --> 00:36:23.114
That's right.

00:36:26.951 --> 00:36:28.319
Should we toast again?

00:36:28.386 --> 00:36:30.021
Shall we?

00:36:31.055 --> 00:36:32.890
- Ready?
- Wait.

00:36:33.824 --> 00:36:35.393
Let's do a new one.

00:36:35.459 --> 00:36:36.527
What?

00:36:37.161 --> 00:36:38.262
Yeah.

00:36:38.329 --> 00:36:40.932
A new one? What should we toast to?

00:36:40.998 --> 00:36:42.733
How about this?

00:36:42.800 --> 00:36:44.535
To surviving tomorrow.

00:36:46.537 --> 00:36:48.706
Wait, Riko's usually the cool one.

00:36:48.773 --> 00:36:50.041
Nice.

00:36:50.107 --> 00:36:51.776
Ready?

00:36:51.842 --> 00:36:54.245
- To survive tomorrow.
- To survive tomorrow.

00:36:54.312 --> 00:36:55.546
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

00:36:57.381 --> 00:36:58.783
Here you are.

00:36:58.849 --> 00:37:00.885
Here is your bear hot pot.

00:37:01.919 --> 00:37:03.955
Oh, wow.

00:37:04.021 --> 00:37:05.856
It's fully cooked

00:37:05.923 --> 00:37:07.892
so dig right in.

00:37:15.032 --> 00:37:17.301
This is what bear tastes like?

00:37:18.636 --> 00:37:19.770
It's delicious.

00:37:19.837 --> 00:37:21.072
- Tasty.
- Is it?

00:37:21.138 --> 00:37:23.307
Yeah, the beef's nice.

00:37:23.874 --> 00:37:24.909
No, it's bear.

00:37:37.388 --> 00:37:40.524
MATERNITY HEALTH RECORDS

00:37:40.591 --> 00:37:41.792
It's not my baby.

00:37:46.964 --> 00:37:48.499
Accept it.

00:37:59.610 --> 00:38:01.178
It's so warm.

00:38:04.048 --> 00:38:06.751
This is nice.
The veggies are good too.

00:38:09.520 --> 00:38:11.222
You just had to kill him, huh?

00:38:24.869 --> 00:38:26.871
