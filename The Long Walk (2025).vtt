but none quite as glory-filled
as the very first,

22:13.723 --> 22:15.157
and the very last.

22:15.935 --> 22:18.725
Today, we walk for Curly.

22:18.794 --> 22:20.001
Let's hear it, boys!

22:20.070 --> 22:21.333
WALKERS: For Curly!

22:21.401 --> 22:22.769
MAJOR: Goddamn right!

22:25.173 --> 22:26.267
Hey, what is it?

22:27.341 --> 22:28.478
You and the Major.

22:34.845 --> 22:37.355
Canteen, 47 callin' for canteen.

22:45.164 --> 22:47.525
Hey, why'd you touch
that carbine?

22:47.594 --> 22:49.158
Like knockin' on wood, I guess.

22:51.794 --> 22:53.228
You a dear boy, Ray.

22:58.768 --> 23:00.004
I gotta take a leak.

23:00.978 --> 23:02.371
Watch out, boys!

23:02.440 --> 23:03.579
Incoming!

23:05.283 --> 23:06.381
-Oh, what the hell?
-Oh, man.

23:06.450 --> 23:07.580
-It got on my shoes!
-WALKER 1: Whoa,

23:07.649 --> 23:08.645
watch where you point
that thing, man!

23:08.714 --> 23:10.481
Jesus fucking Christ, McVries!

23:10.549 --> 23:12.522
Now, that is a relief.

23:19.159 --> 23:20.556
Hey.

23:20.625 --> 23:21.762
You gettin' tired?

23:22.965 --> 23:24.431
No.

23:24.500 --> 23:26.327
Been tired
for quite a while now.

23:27.171 --> 23:28.439
What, you mean you're not?

23:28.907 --> 23:30.073
Listen, Ray.

23:30.141 --> 23:31.568
It's like the Major said...

23:31.636 --> 23:33.639
ain't no finish line.

23:33.708 --> 23:36.247
That's the biggest
mind-fuck in this race.

23:36.315 --> 23:39.008
-Would you agree?
-I wouldn't disagree.

23:39.076 --> 23:40.480
It's just, you know,
I'm already feelin' it.

23:40.549 --> 23:41.845
I'm not sure
how much longer I can...

23:41.914 --> 23:43.746
No, no, no, Ray, Ray.
Come on, now.

23:43.814 --> 23:45.685
That's how everybody thinks.

23:45.754 --> 23:48.358
But you see, we,
we gotta think different.

23:48.427 --> 23:49.784
We don't think about
makin' it to the end,

23:49.852 --> 23:51.525
we think about moments.

23:51.593 --> 23:54.296
Just makin' it
to the next moment.

23:54.365 --> 23:56.758
Yeah. What do we think
about now?

23:56.826 --> 23:58.766
Well, that one's easy.

23:58.835 --> 24:01.665
We just gotta make it through
this goddamn heat, boy.

24:01.733 --> 24:03.000
-(ALL CHUCKLING)
-Oh, my God.

24:03.069 --> 24:04.269
-RAYMOND: It's a scorcher.
-You got that right.

24:04.338 --> 24:05.542
(PETER CHUCKLES)

24:06.669 --> 24:09.038
Hey, Ray.

24:09.106 --> 24:11.205
What you said back there
about the Long Walk,

24:11.273 --> 24:13.641
and how no one ever
really volunteers...

24:13.710 --> 24:15.051
RAYMOND: Yeah?

24:15.119 --> 24:16.652
Where'd it come from?

24:18.023 --> 24:19.314
M... my dad said it.

24:21.117 --> 24:22.922
Your dad's
one smart motherfucker.

24:24.260 --> 24:25.463
Yeah, I think so, too.

24:27.392 --> 24:29.658
Hey, just go on dancing with me
like this forever,<i> compadre...</i>

24:29.727 --> 24:31.158
and I'll never tire.

24:31.227 --> 24:32.995
Hey, we'll scrape
our shoes on the stars,

24:33.063 --> 24:35.473
and hang upside down
from the moon.

24:36.041 --> 24:38.365
You a poet, Pete?

24:38.434 --> 24:40.569
In days past, I would've liked
to have been a...

24:40.638 --> 24:41.908
a songwriter.

24:43.444 --> 24:44.546
But it ain't those days,

24:44.615 --> 24:46.511
so I guess I'm stuck here
riffing for you.

24:46.579 --> 24:48.075
Hope it's not too bad.

24:48.144 --> 24:50.418
-PETER: Ain't too bad.
-Hey, bud.

24:50.487 --> 24:53.084
You're, uh,
Raymond Garraty, right?

24:54.487 --> 24:55.526
I'm Pearson.

24:57.056 --> 24:59.354
I think you got
a secret admirer over there.

25:00.758 --> 25:02.695
Ray, Ray, I love you!

25:02.763 --> 25:04.758
Come on, man.
She must be like 14.

25:04.827 --> 25:06.569
I love you, Ray!

25:06.638 --> 25:08.030
Maybe she just wants
your autograph, that's all.

25:08.099 --> 25:09.530
HANK: Hey, I thought
spectators weren't

25:09.598 --> 25:10.271
fuckin' allowed,
'cause we're on television
and shit.

25:10.339 --> 25:11.374
Get out of here, man.

25:11.443 --> 25:14.235
Come on.
Don't be a sourpuss, Olson.

25:14.304 --> 25:17.073
The boy's got a fan.
Let him have his fun.

25:17.142 --> 25:20.048
-Thanks, Pete.
-Hey, don't thank me too much.

25:20.117 --> 25:21.418
I like you,

25:21.487 --> 25:23.521
but if you fall over,
I won't pick you up.

25:25.115 --> 25:26.447
We're all in this
together, right?

25:27.822 --> 25:29.857
No harm in keeping
each other amused.

25:30.886 --> 25:32.428
(PETER CHUCKLES)

25:32.496 --> 25:35.258
Do you know what?
I take it back.

25:35.327 --> 25:36.794
They say you shouldn't
make friends on the Long Walk,

25:36.863 --> 25:39.364
but fuck it.
I sorta like you three.

25:39.433 --> 25:40.566
Even you, Olson.

25:40.635 --> 25:42.734
-Fuck off.
-No, I'm serious.

25:42.803 --> 25:44.473
Hey, hey, hey,
a short friendship

25:44.542 --> 25:45.870
is better than
no friendship, right?

25:45.938 --> 25:46.970
That's what
I've been sayin', man.

25:47.039 --> 25:49.709
That's what I'm be sayin'.
(CHUCKLING)

25:49.777 --> 25:51.942
Come on, man.
Let's be Musketeers.

25:52.011 --> 25:54.308
How the fuck are
we gonna be Musketeers?

25:54.377 --> 25:56.883
-There's four of us.
-PETER: Come on, now.

25:56.952 --> 25:58.317
We stick together
till we're all that's left.

25:58.386 --> 25:59.817
How about that?

25:59.886 --> 26:01.656
-All for one!
-And one for all.

26:01.725 --> 26:04.591
Nah. And again.
I need to hear it louder.

26:04.660 --> 26:06.725
-All for one!
-And one for all!

Oh, you trying to...
You trying to suck
this dick, Barkovitch?

26:14.333 --> 26:16.631
Sounds like you wanna eat
my fuckin' meat, you sick fuck.

26:16.700 --> 26:17.773
Fuck! Ah!

26:18.869 --> 26:20.235
My legs feel funny.

26:20.304 --> 26:22.275
It's like the muscles are
all turning baggy.

26:22.344 --> 26:23.576
Hey, relax.

for us. Yeah?

I keep hoping
that part gets easier.

till my cock turns blue.

Hey, I could even get horny
for you, Ray...

-Kinda went away for a while,

in the meantime, Pete...

30:10.432 --> 30:11.842
wanna tell us about that scar?

Baker's right.
Maybe we just, um,

30:18.910 --> 30:19.982
we keep quiet.

'cause...

well, I'm allergic to the SPAM.
I gave all that shit away.

meanin' to ask you,

"Rank," is it short for,
like, "Ranklin"?

Like, "Ranklin Delano
Roosevelt" or something?

31:16.704 --> 31:18.567
It's "Rank."

31:18.636 --> 31:20.639
Yeah, but what's it short for?
