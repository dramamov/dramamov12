WEBVTT

00:00:06.773 --> 00:00:09.909
How do you like the finish, ma'am?

00:00:09.976 --> 00:00:11.778
They're beautiful.

00:00:11.945 --> 00:00:14.514
Perfect for my vacation
in Hawaii next month.

00:00:14.581 --> 00:00:17.083
A vacation in Hawaii? I'm jealous.

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:20.653
Yes. I've been working
without a break

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:22.455
so I'm rewarding myself.

00:00:22.689 --> 00:00:25.125
- Are you going with your family?
- No.

00:00:25.191 --> 00:00:28.428
I can't bring my daughter-in-law
and her child. They're staying home.

00:00:28.661 --> 00:00:30.730
It's just me and my son.

00:00:31.798 --> 00:00:35.368
I see. I hope you have fun.

00:00:35.435 --> 00:00:36.436
Thank you.

00:00:37.203 --> 00:00:38.338
Excuse me.

00:00:39.773 --> 00:00:40.807
Yudai, what is it?

00:00:42.042 --> 00:00:43.043
What?

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:47.080
He died?

00:00:48.281 --> 00:00:51.918
He just passed away.
Minori contacted me.

00:00:52.552 --> 00:00:53.553
Really.

00:00:54.454 --> 00:00:56.289
The day has finally come.

00:00:57.057 --> 00:00:59.759
Yes. It's finally here, Mom.

00:01:09.936 --> 00:01:12.505
I recognize that man.

00:01:13.339 --> 00:01:15.308
I think he's the chairman
of Tsukishiro Group.

00:01:19.312 --> 00:01:20.647
Mr. Tsukishiro.

00:01:40.166 --> 00:01:43.036
Mom, why is he here?

00:01:43.103 --> 00:01:44.337
I don't know.

00:01:46.239 --> 00:01:48.942
You two are probably still not aware

00:01:50.877 --> 00:01:51.878
of what

00:01:53.346 --> 00:01:55.014
is about to happen.

00:02:00.086 --> 00:02:01.087
Grandpa.

00:02:03.623 --> 00:02:05.925
I have to do this.

00:02:07.794 --> 00:02:11.397
This man wrecked Mom's life.

00:02:12.999 --> 00:02:16.236
These two wrecked my life.

00:02:18.505 --> 00:02:19.506
Soon

00:02:21.174 --> 00:02:23.009
I'll destroy all of them.

00:03:10.423 --> 00:03:15.094
UNTIL I DESTROYED
MY HUSBAND'S OTHER FAMILY

00:03:16.262 --> 00:03:18.598
- Here, Tsubasa.
- Thank you.

00:03:19.866 --> 00:03:23.102
- Where's Mom?
- She has things to do.

00:03:23.903 --> 00:03:25.238
You have to wait a bit, okay?

00:03:26.339 --> 00:03:27.340
Okay.

00:03:30.043 --> 00:03:31.844
Yudai. Come here for a second.

00:03:35.381 --> 00:03:36.382
What is it?

00:03:36.516 --> 00:03:38.551
What are Minori and that man
talking about?

00:03:38.618 --> 00:03:41.521
That's what I want to know.
How does she know him anyway?

00:03:41.888 --> 00:03:44.490
- Why don't you go take a look?
- You go, Mom.

00:03:44.757 --> 00:03:46.492
How about letting Tsubasa go look?

00:03:48.428 --> 00:03:50.630
I heard everything from my grandpa.

00:03:53.900 --> 00:03:54.901
About my mom.

00:03:57.203 --> 00:03:58.204
About the money.

00:04:01.474 --> 00:04:02.475
And...

00:04:04.978 --> 00:04:07.146
the fact that you are my dad.

00:04:13.519 --> 00:04:15.922
I have no intention of pretending
to be family with you.

00:04:18.691 --> 00:04:19.692
But...

00:04:22.528 --> 00:04:24.597
there is something
I really need to know.

00:04:32.005 --> 00:04:33.406
The day my mom died...

00:04:39.345 --> 00:04:41.981
she went to see you, didn't she?

00:04:47.186 --> 00:04:48.187
Why did my mom

00:04:49.289 --> 00:04:52.125
have to get into that accident?

00:04:56.763 --> 00:04:59.399
Why did she have to die?

00:05:09.842 --> 00:05:10.843
I knew

00:05:12.845 --> 00:05:15.581
I'd have to tell you someday

00:05:17.550 --> 00:05:18.885
about what happened to Miyuki

00:05:20.820 --> 00:05:22.889
and the reason why you were born.

00:05:24.023 --> 00:05:26.826
This is the finest quality,
one of a kind.

00:05:26.893 --> 00:05:27.994
It's beautiful.

00:05:28.061 --> 00:05:30.863
Please feel free to take time
and look closely at them.

00:05:31.898 --> 00:05:34.300
I'm sorry, can I have some water?

00:05:36.102 --> 00:05:37.103
Mr. Tsukishiro.

00:05:37.637 --> 00:05:38.671
May I have a moment?

00:05:39.672 --> 00:05:44.377
I want to introduce Ms. Kume,
a salesperson at our Yokohama branch.

00:05:45.812 --> 00:05:48.147
It's a pleasure to meet you.
I'm Miyuki Kume.

00:05:50.083 --> 00:05:52.218
When I met Miyuki for the first time

00:05:52.919 --> 00:05:55.755
I was captivated by her smile.

00:05:56.723 --> 00:05:57.724
Here.

00:05:59.125 --> 00:06:00.326
I'll be waiting for you to call.

00:06:00.927 --> 00:06:03.129
- What?
- If you don't mind.

00:06:07.133 --> 00:06:10.002
Honey, your dad wants you.

00:06:11.571 --> 00:06:13.439
Yes. I'll be right there.

00:06:21.147 --> 00:06:22.148
Rather

00:06:23.249 --> 00:06:24.984
I couldn't help but be captivated.

00:06:28.588 --> 00:06:31.491
I knew it was forbidden.

00:06:32.625 --> 00:06:34.827
But when I was with her

00:06:36.062 --> 00:06:38.097
the burden of responsibility
as the heir

00:06:38.865 --> 00:06:40.733
and the frustration
with a political marriage

00:06:42.235 --> 00:06:45.138
I felt as though
I could escape it all.

00:06:50.877 --> 00:06:54.147
Sir, Ms. Kume is here.

00:06:55.815 --> 00:06:56.816
Thank you.

00:07:01.120 --> 00:07:02.522
I'm pregnant.

00:07:03.689 --> 00:07:04.690
What?

00:07:05.591 --> 00:07:06.592
I don't know

00:07:07.393 --> 00:07:08.928
what to do.

00:07:11.531 --> 00:07:12.598
I'm sorry.

00:07:20.540 --> 00:07:21.541
Miyuki.

00:07:22.775 --> 00:07:23.776
Thank you.

00:07:26.312 --> 00:07:27.447
I was happy.

00:07:29.282 --> 00:07:31.384
It might be a thorny path

00:07:32.618 --> 00:07:33.986
but I thought I could

00:07:35.154 --> 00:07:37.089
overcome the obstacles
together with her.

00:07:38.424 --> 00:07:39.425
But...

00:07:39.492 --> 00:07:40.860
SUSUMU TSUKISHIRO'S FIRST SCANDAL,
FORBIDDEN LOVE & A BABY?

00:07:41.527 --> 00:07:44.664
- What in the...
- You're a disgrace to our family.

00:07:45.998 --> 00:07:48.901
Do you know how much I had to pay
to stop this article?

00:07:50.069 --> 00:07:53.239
You must break up with that woman.
Immediately.

00:07:56.609 --> 00:07:57.610
I don't want to.

00:07:58.411 --> 00:08:01.781
- I'd rather leave this family than--
- Your words are worthless!

00:08:02.548 --> 00:08:03.549
Listen, Susumu!

00:08:04.951 --> 00:08:06.085
You should know

00:08:07.220 --> 00:08:09.922
that destroying one woman's life

00:08:11.324 --> 00:08:13.793
is easy for me.

00:08:19.599 --> 00:08:20.900
In the end

00:08:22.935 --> 00:08:25.538
I couldn't protect Miyuki.

00:08:27.540 --> 00:08:29.542
I am responsible for everything.

00:08:32.011 --> 00:08:33.079
It was all...

00:08:35.314 --> 00:08:37.984
due to my selfish actions.

00:08:45.057 --> 00:08:46.292
I regret it.

00:08:50.997 --> 00:08:52.298
Why couldn't I

00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:56.002
choose Miyuki at that moment?

00:08:59.772 --> 00:09:00.873
Please stop.

00:09:03.943 --> 00:09:06.279
What my mom did was unforgivable.

00:09:07.980 --> 00:09:09.682
And so she brought it on herself.

00:09:12.685 --> 00:09:14.453
Karma got her in the end,
as they say.

00:09:17.023 --> 00:09:18.024
After all

00:09:19.659 --> 00:09:21.460
- she had an affair.
- That's not true.

00:09:21.527 --> 00:09:22.528
It's true!

00:09:25.164 --> 00:09:26.165
It's true.

00:09:30.570 --> 00:09:32.038
Miyuki died...

00:09:35.508 --> 00:09:36.943
because of me.

00:09:38.544 --> 00:09:40.680
Five years had passed since then.

00:09:42.982 --> 00:09:43.983
Susumu!

00:09:45.351 --> 00:09:47.420
Miyuki suddenly came

00:09:47.486 --> 00:09:48.487
to see me.

00:09:48.754 --> 00:09:51.657
Miyuki. What are you doing here?

00:09:52.692 --> 00:09:53.859
I have a favor to ask.

00:09:54.994 --> 00:09:57.396
I want you to meet Minori just once.

00:09:58.331 --> 00:09:59.332
Minori?

00:10:08.274 --> 00:10:09.408
Is this girl...

00:10:10.309 --> 00:10:12.945
Minori is feeling so lonely.

00:10:13.779 --> 00:10:17.917
It was her birthday the other day,
and when I asked her what she wanted

00:10:19.218 --> 00:10:20.319
she said, "Dad."

00:10:24.290 --> 00:10:26.058
Sir, it's time
for your next appointment.

00:10:29.595 --> 00:10:30.596
Sir.

00:10:34.133 --> 00:10:35.167
Wait!

00:10:35.234 --> 00:10:37.169
You said I wouldn't have to see her.

00:10:37.670 --> 00:10:39.472
It's over between us.

00:10:40.039 --> 00:10:42.975
- Don't cling to me like this.
- Wait!

00:10:43.142 --> 00:10:45.344
Please don't go!

00:10:45.878 --> 00:10:47.713
Susumu! Wait!

00:11:15.141 --> 00:11:16.142
I apologize

00:11:17.410 --> 00:11:19.178
for what I've done to you.

00:11:21.013 --> 00:11:22.748
I'm so sorry.

00:11:31.023 --> 00:11:32.024
She did it

00:11:33.025 --> 00:11:34.026
for me?

00:11:39.198 --> 00:11:40.299
Mom.

00:11:44.537 --> 00:11:45.871
Mom.

00:11:48.574 --> 00:11:50.109
Mom.

00:11:52.778 --> 00:11:55.047
Mom.

00:11:56.182 --> 00:11:57.349
Mom.

00:12:00.352 --> 00:12:01.353
Mom!

00:12:05.791 --> 00:12:06.792
Tsubasa.

00:12:08.861 --> 00:12:10.563
Mom, are you crying?

00:12:13.332 --> 00:12:14.500
I'm not crying.

00:12:15.301 --> 00:12:18.070
I just had dust in my eyes.

00:12:19.438 --> 00:12:21.407
Are you okay? Let me see.

00:12:23.976 --> 00:12:26.178
I'm okay. Thank you.

00:12:27.279 --> 00:12:28.280
Tsubasa.

00:12:29.915 --> 00:12:32.084
Can you wait outside
just a little bit more?

00:12:33.018 --> 00:12:34.253
I'll be with you in a minute.

00:12:34.820 --> 00:12:35.855
What?

00:12:37.490 --> 00:12:39.225
- Okay?
- Okay.

00:12:39.425 --> 00:12:40.426
Okay.

00:12:48.901 --> 00:12:50.536
Such a cute boy.

00:12:52.905 --> 00:12:53.906
Yes.

00:12:56.375 --> 00:12:58.477
My son is the most
precious thing to me.

00:13:03.916 --> 00:13:04.917
For the rest of my life

00:13:06.519 --> 00:13:10.589
I intend to atone for what I did
by making sure you live comfortably.

00:13:17.363 --> 00:13:18.397
Atone?

00:13:20.166 --> 00:13:22.368
I'll do anything I can.

00:13:24.537 --> 00:13:25.538
Then...

00:13:29.608 --> 00:13:30.910
could you

00:13:34.046 --> 00:13:35.748
do me a favor?

00:13:47.326 --> 00:13:48.828
Are you calling Ms. Kume?

00:13:49.762 --> 00:13:52.531
- Hey. Give it back.
- I thought so.

00:13:56.836 --> 00:13:59.972
I went to see Ms. Kume and warned her

00:14:01.140 --> 00:14:03.542
that seducing a minor is a crime.

00:14:05.277 --> 00:14:07.213
Why did you do that?

00:14:07.279 --> 00:14:08.447
Because

00:14:09.348 --> 00:14:10.382
I saw you

00:14:11.250 --> 00:14:13.219
coming out of Ms. Kume's house.

00:14:16.789 --> 00:14:17.790
It was weird.

00:14:18.791 --> 00:14:20.659
It didn't look
like a normal relationship.

00:14:22.661 --> 00:14:23.662
Again

00:14:24.830 --> 00:14:27.199
- it shouldn't matter to you.
- It matters!

00:14:29.835 --> 00:14:32.638
Why do you have feelings
for someone you can't be with?

00:14:37.676 --> 00:14:38.978
Why can't you choose me?

00:14:46.185 --> 00:14:47.186
I'm sorry.

00:14:51.590 --> 00:14:52.591
Forget it.

00:15:03.202 --> 00:15:08.073
What? Minori is the daughter
of the chairman of Tsukishiro Group?

00:15:09.408 --> 00:15:12.211
I know this sudden revelation
must be unbelievable.

00:15:13.245 --> 00:15:15.481
I found out just recently, too.

00:15:16.015 --> 00:15:19.118
Why did you keep such important
information from us?

00:15:19.818 --> 00:15:23.689
You have to forgive me.
I didn't believe it at first either.

00:15:24.390 --> 00:15:25.858
It's hard to believe, isn't it?

00:15:26.525 --> 00:15:28.928
We just heard it now

00:15:29.161 --> 00:15:31.430
and we're thoroughly surprised.

00:15:31.597 --> 00:15:33.499
Thank you for telling us.

00:15:36.802 --> 00:15:37.803
So...

00:15:39.605 --> 00:15:42.408
what were you talking about
with the chairman?

00:15:45.377 --> 00:15:46.412
We were...

00:15:49.381 --> 00:15:51.684
talking about money in the future.

00:15:56.322 --> 00:15:57.756
I see.

00:15:59.925 --> 00:16:02.728
Your grandpa just passed away.

00:16:03.028 --> 00:16:04.396
It must have been hard.

00:16:06.065 --> 00:16:09.668
We're here to help you
with any problems you might have.

00:16:10.369 --> 00:16:11.370
That's right.

00:16:12.471 --> 00:16:14.139
Don't try to fix everything
by yourself.

00:16:15.307 --> 00:16:16.475
He's right.

00:16:17.242 --> 00:16:19.445
We're your family after all.

00:16:24.483 --> 00:16:25.718
Yes, you are.

00:16:27.453 --> 00:16:30.356
We're family after all.

00:16:30.889 --> 00:16:31.890
Yes.

00:16:32.691 --> 00:16:34.426
That's why
you should rely on us more.

00:16:34.727 --> 00:16:36.161
Especially about money.

00:16:36.228 --> 00:16:37.663
About money?

00:16:41.834 --> 00:16:42.968
Yes.

00:16:44.136 --> 00:16:46.505
It's not just my problem.

00:16:46.972 --> 00:16:49.775
Yes. There's Tsubasa, too.

00:16:50.609 --> 00:16:51.910
Thank you.

00:16:52.878 --> 00:16:55.547
I'll be asking you for advice
if I need help.

00:17:11.530 --> 00:17:14.366
It's been a long wait.

00:17:15.601 --> 00:17:18.404
But this way of living
is coming to an end.

00:17:19.104 --> 00:17:21.173
Soon, my dream will come true!

00:17:21.774 --> 00:17:23.409
CALL IN PROGRESS

00:17:23.475 --> 00:17:25.811
- Yes.
- Hello!

00:17:26.078 --> 00:17:28.380
I'm Kisaragi from Smile Home Service.

00:17:29.248 --> 00:17:30.249
I'm proud of myself

00:17:31.016 --> 00:17:34.586
for working so hard to get this.

00:17:35.754 --> 00:17:36.755
That's why

00:17:37.523 --> 00:17:40.692
I feel like God is acknowledging
my efforts up to this point.

00:17:43.595 --> 00:17:46.098
Hello. I'll be helping you
with housework again today.

00:17:46.365 --> 00:17:48.434
- Oh, hold on.
- Yes?

00:17:49.568 --> 00:17:53.338
Actually, we suddenly need
to move overseas

00:17:53.739 --> 00:17:56.175
because of my husband's work.

00:17:56.975 --> 00:18:00.345
I'm sorry,
but today will be your last day.

00:18:01.313 --> 00:18:03.782
- You mean--
- We'll be sure to pay you

00:18:03.849 --> 00:18:05.017
for today's work.

00:18:05.084 --> 00:18:06.652
- Wait--
- I'm really sorry.

00:18:06.718 --> 00:18:08.754
Wait a minute!

00:18:11.423 --> 00:18:12.424
What?

00:18:14.426 --> 00:18:15.894
What was that?

00:18:16.662 --> 00:18:18.630
How disrespectful, all of a sudden.

00:18:19.932 --> 00:18:23.235
Oh, well. I guess it was good timing.

00:18:24.436 --> 00:18:25.838
Pretty soon

00:18:26.738 --> 00:18:29.608
I'll be in a position where
I won't have to work ever again.

00:18:31.310 --> 00:18:34.880
I'm following my heart
No matter how selfish

00:18:34.947 --> 00:18:37.916
- My love, I'll never hurt you...
- Wait a minute!

00:18:38.717 --> 00:18:40.619
Was there some kind of mistake
on our part?

00:18:41.120 --> 00:18:43.188
May I ask what the reason is?

00:18:43.422 --> 00:18:44.823
Hello?

00:18:45.924 --> 00:18:46.925
What's the matter?

00:18:47.593 --> 00:18:50.629
This client wants to suspend
all transactions with us.

00:18:50.762 --> 00:18:52.664
What? Which client?

00:18:53.198 --> 00:18:56.535
All restaurants affiliated
with Tsukishiro Group.

00:18:58.403 --> 00:19:00.172
Tsukishiro Group? For what reason?

00:19:00.239 --> 00:19:02.608
I asked,
but they weren't clear about it.

00:19:02.908 --> 00:19:04.443
This has never happened before.

00:19:06.111 --> 00:19:08.914
What do you mean by "terminated?"

00:19:08.981 --> 00:19:10.549
I'm so sorry.

00:19:10.616 --> 00:19:13.185
- I'm sorry.
- Some other time.

00:19:14.486 --> 00:19:15.487
What?

00:19:19.057 --> 00:19:21.727
I wonder what he did.

00:19:22.261 --> 00:19:23.295
Beats me.

00:19:23.595 --> 00:19:27.599
But losing the deal
with Tsukishiro Group is a big loss.

00:19:29.001 --> 00:19:31.336
How is Mr. Kisaragi
going to remedy this?

00:19:34.473 --> 00:19:37.109
Chief. Are you okay?

00:19:38.644 --> 00:19:39.645
Yes.

00:19:41.079 --> 00:19:43.282
What made them decide
to do that so suddenly?

00:19:44.283 --> 00:19:46.418
There were no complaints,
so it's strange.

00:19:47.719 --> 00:19:48.887
We're in trouble.

00:19:50.355 --> 00:19:51.356
Chief.

00:19:52.057 --> 00:19:54.059
There's someone here to see you.

00:20:12.077 --> 00:20:13.078
Wataru?

00:20:15.180 --> 00:20:16.181
Why...

00:20:21.720 --> 00:20:24.289
What brings you all the way here?

00:20:25.224 --> 00:20:26.225
Who's that?

00:20:26.592 --> 00:20:27.726
Mr. Kisaragi's son?

00:20:27.859 --> 00:20:30.796
I don't think so.
His son is five years old.

00:20:32.864 --> 00:20:33.865
Wataru?

00:20:38.704 --> 00:20:40.172
I want you to break up with Mom.

00:20:44.243 --> 00:20:45.244
What?

00:20:45.944 --> 00:20:48.880
I want you to break up with my mom.

00:20:49.881 --> 00:20:52.150
Break up? What does he mean?

00:20:55.420 --> 00:20:57.656
You've got to take
good care of your wife.

00:20:58.590 --> 00:21:00.525
"Your wife?"

00:21:01.760 --> 00:21:03.128
Are you having an affair?

00:21:03.895 --> 00:21:06.665
- What?
- Is he having an affair?

00:21:10.769 --> 00:21:11.770
Chief?

00:21:13.105 --> 00:21:14.406
What the hell are you saying?

00:21:15.374 --> 00:21:16.375
I don't want you

00:21:17.509 --> 00:21:19.278
to torment my mom any more.

00:21:19.711 --> 00:21:22.014
I don't know what you're
talking about, Wataru.

00:21:23.115 --> 00:21:24.283
Let's talk privately.

00:21:27.185 --> 00:21:28.887
Do you really love Mom?

00:21:30.222 --> 00:21:31.823
Enough. Come with me now--

00:21:31.890 --> 00:21:33.525
You can't divorce your wife, right?

00:21:33.725 --> 00:21:35.460
Even though you promised
you'll marry Mom.

00:21:35.527 --> 00:21:37.829
- That's enough, Wataru!
- Right back at you!

00:21:41.199 --> 00:21:42.801
In the end, you were all talk.

00:21:47.439 --> 00:21:48.440
What's with this

00:21:50.208 --> 00:21:52.210
ungrateful attitude
after all I've done for you?

00:22:06.291 --> 00:22:07.659
What a terrible thing to say.

00:22:10.495 --> 00:22:12.297
I totally understand now.

00:22:14.599 --> 00:22:18.070
I can't let you take care of Mom
or the baby on the way!

00:22:20.572 --> 00:22:22.374
I can't trust you with them.

00:22:35.954 --> 00:22:37.723
No, it's not what you think!

00:22:38.857 --> 00:22:41.827
Just forget what you saw.

00:22:56.375 --> 00:22:57.576
Why...

00:23:04.082 --> 00:23:05.684
Something is wrong.

00:23:09.821 --> 00:23:11.957
Things started
to go wrong from that day.

00:23:13.592 --> 00:23:15.427
Everything has happened
since that day.

00:23:22.334 --> 00:23:23.335
Coming.

00:23:24.669 --> 00:23:27.606
Mother! What brings you here?

00:23:28.206 --> 00:23:32.677
I was passing by and decided to visit
to see Tsubasa's face.

00:23:33.044 --> 00:23:34.446
Oh, I see.

00:23:34.679 --> 00:23:36.982
- Tsubasa will be happy.
- Thank you.

00:23:37.182 --> 00:23:38.183
Please come in.

00:23:40.218 --> 00:23:42.020
Thank you for letting me in.

00:23:46.625 --> 00:23:51.229
But Mother,
wasn't today the day you have work?

00:23:52.063 --> 00:23:53.064
Well...

00:23:54.266 --> 00:23:55.300
about that.

00:23:56.668 --> 00:23:57.803
I quit my job.

00:23:58.470 --> 00:24:02.240
I'm taking a break for a while.
I've been working for a long time.

00:24:05.277 --> 00:24:06.278
You quit?

00:24:07.979 --> 00:24:09.014
Gosh.

00:24:11.016 --> 00:24:14.686
You were forced to quit.
Isn't that the truth?

00:24:16.254 --> 00:24:17.255
What?

00:24:18.924 --> 00:24:21.893
I mean, you were fired. Right?

00:24:26.431 --> 00:24:27.432
You...

00:24:29.935 --> 00:24:31.369
You were

00:24:32.204 --> 00:24:33.805
responsible for all this,
weren't you?

00:24:36.608 --> 00:24:39.144
Yes! I did it!

00:24:45.417 --> 00:24:48.220
W-Why would you do that?

00:24:49.654 --> 00:24:50.655
Why?

00:24:52.023 --> 00:24:54.359
You were the one
who betrayed me first, didn't you?

00:24:56.361 --> 00:25:00.532
If you want another job, why don't
you go ask the Tsukishiro family?

00:25:01.466 --> 00:25:02.467
Why?

00:25:04.569 --> 00:25:08.106
The big corporation
you were talking about.

00:25:08.340 --> 00:25:10.008
It was the Tsukishiro family,
wasn't it?

00:25:11.142 --> 00:25:12.377
What? What are you saying?

00:25:13.245 --> 00:25:16.515
Susumu Tsukishiro gladly agreed
to cooperate.

00:25:17.415 --> 00:25:20.986
He was holding a grudge
against you, too.

00:25:23.255 --> 00:25:24.589
This woman.

00:25:27.893 --> 00:25:28.894
She is...

00:25:31.296 --> 00:25:32.531
my mother-in-law.

00:25:34.866 --> 00:25:39.437
It was you who sold the story
of his affair to a magazine.

00:25:41.439 --> 00:25:44.576
He had no idea that the woman
who sold the story

00:25:44.643 --> 00:25:46.811
was someone close to me.

00:25:49.347 --> 00:25:51.149
Did you want money so desperately

00:25:51.216 --> 00:25:52.918
that you didn't care
who you destroyed?

00:25:57.923 --> 00:26:00.358
That wasn't my intention!

00:26:04.229 --> 00:26:05.630
But Mother...

00:26:07.399 --> 00:26:10.168
you got ahead of yourself a bit,
didn't you?

00:26:14.506 --> 00:26:16.308
You signed up for a beauty clinic.

00:26:18.209 --> 00:26:20.345
You planned an overseas vacation.

00:26:21.780 --> 00:26:26.184
And you went to a nail salon,
a bit prematurely.

00:26:30.622 --> 00:26:31.823
Unfortunately...

00:26:35.660 --> 00:26:38.296
you're not getting any money at all.

00:26:42.167 --> 00:26:44.569
So please abandon

00:26:45.270 --> 00:26:47.973
all the dreams you had.

00:26:55.313 --> 00:26:58.183
You tricked me, didn't you?!

00:26:58.249 --> 00:26:59.918
Tricked you?!

00:27:02.554 --> 00:27:05.357
This is the way you treat me
right at the last moment?

00:27:06.224 --> 00:27:08.827
After all that I did for you?

00:27:09.661 --> 00:27:11.930
- Mom!
- Shut up!

00:27:12.631 --> 00:27:14.766
I hate you, Grandma! Go away!

00:27:15.333 --> 00:27:17.936
- You brat!
- I'm glad

00:27:19.604 --> 00:27:22.207
that Tsubasa hates you now.

00:27:29.080 --> 00:27:30.115
Which means

00:27:31.616 --> 00:27:35.086
I can cut ties with you
without any regrets.

00:28:01.046 --> 00:28:02.247
It was satisfying.

00:28:04.115 --> 00:28:05.183
I was hoping to see

00:28:06.284 --> 00:28:10.088
that face distorted in despair.

00:28:16.828 --> 00:28:17.929
What I am doing

00:28:19.264 --> 00:28:21.266
is the right thing.

00:28:27.872 --> 00:28:30.308
Wataru? How was it?

00:28:33.311 --> 00:28:34.312
Can I...

00:28:35.213 --> 00:28:36.414
talk to you now?

00:28:38.216 --> 00:28:39.951
It's fine. How was it?

00:28:41.252 --> 00:28:42.487
When Yudai said...

00:28:45.824 --> 00:28:48.026
that I'm ungrateful
after all he's done for me...

00:28:51.663 --> 00:28:52.897
I realized

00:28:54.833 --> 00:28:56.167
this person

00:28:57.902 --> 00:28:59.537
didn't really care...

00:29:01.940 --> 00:29:04.809
about me or my mom.

00:29:09.013 --> 00:29:10.248
Realizing that fact...

00:29:13.952 --> 00:29:15.253
was shocking to me.

00:29:17.555 --> 00:29:18.556
But...

00:29:20.291 --> 00:29:22.994
I also hurt Yudai.

00:29:26.531 --> 00:29:29.868
I know I shouldn't be
saying this to you.

00:29:32.904 --> 00:29:33.938
But I...

00:29:36.007 --> 00:29:38.409
I liked Yudai a lot.

00:29:46.251 --> 00:29:47.652
I can imagine how much harder...

00:29:50.688 --> 00:29:53.057
this is for you, Minori.

00:30:08.306 --> 00:30:09.307
Minori.

00:30:13.111 --> 00:30:15.079
I'm on your side.

00:30:17.215 --> 00:30:18.783
I hope you believe it,
no matter what.

00:30:24.789 --> 00:30:25.790
Someday

00:30:27.892 --> 00:30:31.062
I'll become a man
who could support you.

00:30:34.199 --> 00:30:35.200
When that time comes...

00:30:37.335 --> 00:30:38.336
I hope

00:30:39.537 --> 00:30:40.638
you'll see me again.

00:30:43.608 --> 00:30:44.609
Bye, then.

00:31:02.994 --> 00:31:03.995
What I'm doing...

00:31:07.632 --> 00:31:09.434
is the right thing.

00:31:14.873 --> 00:31:15.874
What I'm doing

00:31:18.443 --> 00:31:20.245
is the right thing.

00:31:25.216 --> 00:31:26.217
I'm...

00:31:34.792 --> 00:31:35.793
Come home. Let's talk. No response

00:31:35.860 --> 00:31:36.861
Are you eating properly?
Do you have enough money?

00:31:36.928 --> 00:31:37.929
No response, Where are you?

00:31:37.996 --> 00:31:38.997
No response,
I'm worried, call me. No response

00:31:39.230 --> 00:31:40.231
Wataru.

00:31:55.813 --> 00:32:00.985
YUDAI

00:32:01.920 --> 00:32:03.521
Why aren't you answering?

00:32:08.927 --> 00:32:10.094
Where are you? Call me.

00:32:10.161 --> 00:32:11.996
Why are you ignoring me
when I'm in trouble?

00:32:12.063 --> 00:32:14.933
Aren't you worried about your mom?

00:32:29.213 --> 00:32:30.448
I'm home.

00:32:31.215 --> 00:32:34.185
Hi. You're late today.

00:32:35.720 --> 00:32:37.522
Yes. I was busy at work.

00:32:38.389 --> 00:32:39.791
You haven't eaten yet, have you?

00:32:41.993 --> 00:32:45.563
I made rice cooked with eggplant.

00:32:49.767 --> 00:32:51.235
You like eggplant, don't you?

00:32:53.371 --> 00:32:54.372
Yes.

00:32:58.576 --> 00:32:59.577
Thank you for the meal.

00:33:05.249 --> 00:33:07.485
- It's good.
- Really?

00:33:08.653 --> 00:33:09.921
I'm glad.

00:33:13.558 --> 00:33:14.559
By the way...

00:33:17.762 --> 00:33:18.763
Did you...

00:33:20.598 --> 00:33:21.599
hear anything?

00:33:24.302 --> 00:33:25.436
Like what?

00:33:26.437 --> 00:33:28.172
Never mind.

00:33:33.511 --> 00:33:34.779
Which is more delicious?

00:33:37.215 --> 00:33:38.583
My cooking

00:33:40.418 --> 00:33:41.819
or Riko's cooking?

00:33:46.491 --> 00:33:47.492
What?

00:33:47.892 --> 00:33:49.027
W-What are you saying?

00:33:49.761 --> 00:33:51.162
You eat her cooking every week

00:33:52.363 --> 00:33:53.698
with your other family, right?

00:33:58.136 --> 00:33:59.137
Hey.

00:34:01.139 --> 00:34:03.775
Which is better?

00:34:06.577 --> 00:34:07.578
Wait...

00:34:08.679 --> 00:34:10.014
Are you okay?

00:34:10.848 --> 00:34:13.718
Minori. Let me explain.

00:34:14.752 --> 00:34:17.321
It's too late to panic now.

00:34:18.189 --> 00:34:20.058
Didn't your mom tell you?

00:34:20.358 --> 00:34:21.392
Mom?

00:34:25.463 --> 00:34:27.165
HIROMI KISARAGI: MISSED CALL
YUDAI! CONTACT ME IF YOU SEE THIS!

00:34:28.800 --> 00:34:31.235
Minori knows everything.

00:34:32.703 --> 00:34:33.704
Everything?

00:34:34.972 --> 00:34:35.973
Yes.

00:34:37.508 --> 00:34:38.910
Everything!

00:34:40.545 --> 00:34:42.146
I know everything.

00:34:42.447 --> 00:34:44.115
Wait! It's not like that.

00:34:44.182 --> 00:34:45.650
I just lost myself for...

00:34:54.625 --> 00:34:56.327
You just lost yourself

00:34:57.762 --> 00:35:00.131
for more than ten years?

00:35:02.233 --> 00:35:04.602
And so you were cheating on me

00:35:08.072 --> 00:35:10.408
with a high school class mate?

00:35:11.008 --> 00:35:12.643
For more than ten years

00:35:13.144 --> 00:35:16.581
you continued to betray
me and Tsubasa!

00:35:16.647 --> 00:35:20.118
Minori, calm down.
Let's talk this through.

00:35:33.531 --> 00:35:35.299
You're not going to divorce me,
are you?

00:35:35.600 --> 00:35:37.301
W-We have to think about Tsubasa.

00:35:45.343 --> 00:35:46.511
Tsubasa?

00:35:52.150 --> 00:35:53.684
Why don't you worry instead...

00:35:56.821 --> 00:35:59.423
about the baby
that's going to be born?

00:36:00.324 --> 00:36:01.325
What?

00:36:02.560 --> 00:36:06.264
You know it's not easy
raising a child.

00:36:07.365 --> 00:36:09.367
It requires so much money.

00:36:13.037 --> 00:36:16.474
Do you think you can
keep working at your job

00:36:16.541 --> 00:36:19.010
even if they knew
you were having an affair?

00:36:19.677 --> 00:36:20.811
How do you know that?

00:36:23.114 --> 00:36:25.049
No. You didn't ask Wataru to...

00:36:35.960 --> 00:36:37.161
Are you sure you're okay?

00:36:38.095 --> 00:36:41.232
You seem to have been relying
on my assets.

00:36:44.535 --> 00:36:45.670
Too bad.

00:36:47.438 --> 00:36:48.439
Minori.

00:36:51.342 --> 00:36:52.343
Hey.

00:36:52.443 --> 00:36:55.813
Aren't you worried? Your mom
seems to have a lot of debts, too.

00:36:56.547 --> 00:36:57.548
Minori.

00:36:58.416 --> 00:37:00.918
Anyway, let's have a talk.

00:37:02.954 --> 00:37:03.955
We've come this far

00:37:05.223 --> 00:37:06.891
together, right?

00:37:13.898 --> 00:37:15.032
You're right.

00:37:18.502 --> 00:37:19.670
We were...

00:37:22.707 --> 00:37:24.408
together...

00:37:27.278 --> 00:37:28.613
for a very long time.

00:37:29.981 --> 00:37:30.982
Yes.

00:37:31.882 --> 00:37:32.883
That's why

00:37:34.352 --> 00:37:35.353
we should

00:37:36.721 --> 00:37:37.755
start over.

00:37:40.491 --> 00:37:41.525
I apologize.

00:37:45.630 --> 00:37:46.631
Minori.

00:37:47.999 --> 00:37:49.000
I'm sorry.

00:37:51.202 --> 00:37:52.436
I'm really sorry.

00:38:03.047 --> 00:38:04.048
Yudai.

00:38:07.618 --> 00:38:08.619
Lift your head.

00:38:14.692 --> 00:38:16.894
DIVORCE CERTIFICATE

00:38:18.496 --> 00:38:19.497
You and I

00:38:21.699 --> 00:38:23.034
are getting a divorce.

00:38:27.471 --> 00:38:29.907
Infidelity is not a crime?

00:38:30.074 --> 00:38:31.309
Stop messing with me!

00:38:32.777 --> 00:38:35.146
You're the one messing with me!

00:38:35.446 --> 00:38:37.715
You're not part of my family,
you know.

00:38:38.049 --> 00:38:39.116
I love you.

00:38:39.784 --> 00:38:41.218
I want you to believe me.
