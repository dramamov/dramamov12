WEBVTT

00:00:02.635 --> 00:00:04.204
- We survived another day! Cheers!
- We survived another day! Cheers!

00:00:04.270 --> 00:00:05.438
Ever since college

00:00:05.839 --> 00:00:08.575
it was always the three of us.

00:00:09.442 --> 00:00:11.211
An unbreakable bond

00:00:11.511 --> 00:00:13.413
bound by the same sense of justice.

00:00:14.381 --> 00:00:16.149
I know what would make me happy.

00:00:17.183 --> 00:00:20.353
If my husband dies
and leaves me all his money.

00:00:20.754 --> 00:00:23.056
I have to do it
and hide the evidence.

00:00:23.123 --> 00:00:24.290
I'll help.

00:00:27.527 --> 00:00:28.595
What are you doing?

00:00:28.962 --> 00:00:31.131
Do you think it's amnesia?

00:00:31.197 --> 00:00:34.601
If I told you
that I'm killing my husband

00:00:34.667 --> 00:00:35.735
would you help me?

00:00:36.302 --> 00:00:37.537
Did you cheat on me?

00:00:37.604 --> 00:00:41.241
All this time, I was the only one
going crazy thinking about us

00:00:41.674 --> 00:00:42.742
like an idiot!

00:00:43.209 --> 00:00:44.210
I'm sorry.

00:00:45.111 --> 00:00:47.313
- I...
- If only you'd just die!

00:00:55.989 --> 00:00:59.526
PLEASE DIE MY BELOVED

00:00:59.592 --> 00:01:03.496
EPISODE TWO

00:01:10.804 --> 00:01:15.375
He said I'm not efficient,
that I can't remember anything.

00:01:16.543 --> 00:01:18.178
That I can't do anything right.

00:01:19.179 --> 00:01:22.782
My boss was yelling at me
in front of everyone in the office.

00:01:25.385 --> 00:01:29.456
But what he said wasn't wrong.

00:01:31.458 --> 00:01:34.661
I don't think
I'm cut out for this work.

00:01:36.062 --> 00:01:38.198
I don't want to go anymore.

00:01:42.802 --> 00:01:43.803
In that case

00:01:44.771 --> 00:01:46.739
you can just stay at home forever.

00:01:49.342 --> 00:01:52.846
I'd be happy,
knowing you were waiting at home.

00:01:57.016 --> 00:01:59.486
You would make a great wife.

00:02:03.289 --> 00:02:04.290
Will you marry me?

00:02:08.895 --> 00:02:09.896
Yes.

00:02:16.803 --> 00:02:17.804
I love you.

00:02:20.707 --> 00:02:22.308
I thought I found my savior.

00:02:23.176 --> 00:02:26.579
I could escape my awful job
and the boss I couldn't stand.

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:29.516
My supportive husband
would protect me

00:02:29.582 --> 00:02:31.684
and I'd live happily ever after.

00:02:36.489 --> 00:02:40.426
Hey, I told you my gray suit
goes with the blue shirt.

00:02:40.493 --> 00:02:41.861
- I'm sorry.
- Where's breakfast?

00:02:41.995 --> 00:02:43.997
Well, I was just...

00:02:44.063 --> 00:02:46.332
The baby was crying.
Can you take the milk?

00:02:46.399 --> 00:02:47.867
- Here.
- The place is filthy.

00:02:47.934 --> 00:02:49.435
You're so inefficient.

00:02:49.502 --> 00:02:51.404
Can't you even do
the housework right?

00:02:52.438 --> 00:02:54.440
You can't do anything right.

00:02:54.841 --> 00:02:55.975
Get my shirt already.

00:02:57.777 --> 00:02:58.778
Okay.

00:02:59.913 --> 00:03:01.114
But what awaited me

00:03:01.814 --> 00:03:05.718
was a life where the abuse moved
from the office to my own home.

00:03:06.986 --> 00:03:10.690
You're like my useless subordinates
at work. You piss me off.

00:03:10.857 --> 00:03:11.858
Die.

00:03:12.125 --> 00:03:13.193
You say something?

00:03:15.128 --> 00:03:17.397
Die! Just die already!

00:03:28.675 --> 00:03:30.677
I can't remember anything.

00:03:32.178 --> 00:03:33.179
Married?

00:03:34.547 --> 00:03:35.548
A daughter?

00:03:38.251 --> 00:03:40.253
What do I do?

00:03:40.687 --> 00:03:43.823
How do I live from here on out?

00:03:45.258 --> 00:03:46.292
I can't believe it.

00:03:46.793 --> 00:03:49.095
This is the perfect chance.

00:03:51.764 --> 00:03:53.066
Don't worry.

00:03:59.539 --> 00:04:01.040
You have me.

00:04:02.475 --> 00:04:03.977
Everything you need to know

00:04:04.711 --> 00:04:07.614
I'll teach you from the ground up.

00:04:12.452 --> 00:04:13.453
You will?

00:04:17.657 --> 00:04:19.225
I'll retrain you

00:04:19.926 --> 00:04:21.828
into my ideal husband.

00:05:42.675 --> 00:05:45.345
PLEASE DIE MY BELOVED

00:05:50.049 --> 00:05:52.318
This is justice, right?

00:05:54.487 --> 00:05:55.488
It is.

00:06:15.742 --> 00:06:18.411
Three days have passed
since my husband went missing.

00:06:20.480 --> 00:06:22.482
No one has heard from him.

00:06:31.524 --> 00:06:32.525
But

00:06:33.926 --> 00:06:35.061
strangely enough...

00:06:37.397 --> 00:06:38.731
I feel calm.

00:07:00.286 --> 00:07:03.222
I'll never forgive him
for cheating on me.

00:07:16.536 --> 00:07:17.537
But

00:07:18.938 --> 00:07:19.972
I feel calm.

00:07:26.746 --> 00:07:27.980
KUMABE ESTATE

00:07:28.047 --> 00:07:29.682
I'm glad you seem okay, Maya.

00:07:30.249 --> 00:07:31.250
What?

00:07:31.317 --> 00:07:34.821
I thought you'd feel down
after your project was rejected.

00:07:35.521 --> 00:07:37.824
But you look raring to go.

00:07:38.124 --> 00:07:39.625
- Really?
- Yes.

00:07:40.393 --> 00:07:41.961
Your complexion looks good.

00:07:42.028 --> 00:07:43.729
Your skin has brightened up.

00:07:45.097 --> 00:07:46.432
Is your makeup different?

00:07:47.767 --> 00:07:48.768
No, still the same.

00:07:49.101 --> 00:07:52.071
Gosh, did something good happen then?

00:07:53.739 --> 00:07:55.041
No, not really.

00:07:57.944 --> 00:08:00.546
Hiroki, Ran into trouble.
Work trip was extended three days.

00:08:00.613 --> 00:08:02.915
I love you, Riko.

00:08:03.249 --> 00:08:04.250
I miss you so much.

00:08:05.084 --> 00:08:06.586
Gosh.

00:08:08.187 --> 00:08:09.188
I'm fuming.

00:08:09.655 --> 00:08:11.023
But I love you, Riko.

00:08:11.090 --> 00:08:12.091
Here's a heart.

00:08:14.060 --> 00:08:16.796
Hey, getting some nice texts?

00:08:17.530 --> 00:08:18.798
Yes, really nice ones.

00:08:18.865 --> 00:08:21.734
I'm so curious
what's making you so happy.

00:08:21.801 --> 00:08:24.637
A newlywed like you
wouldn't understand.

00:08:24.937 --> 00:08:26.539
What's that supposed to mean?

00:08:26.873 --> 00:08:28.174
I'm not sure.

00:08:31.344 --> 00:08:33.346
Did something good happen, Yurika?

00:08:33.746 --> 00:08:34.747
What?

00:08:35.248 --> 00:08:37.316
Your smile's brighter than usual.

00:08:37.383 --> 00:08:39.452
Yes, I see it too!

00:08:42.421 --> 00:08:43.723
Goodness, it's Noa's mom.

00:08:44.557 --> 00:08:47.293
My, she's as lovely as always!

00:08:48.094 --> 00:08:49.161
Who's that?

00:08:49.328 --> 00:08:50.329
Don't you know?

00:08:50.530 --> 00:08:52.031
A mom from the next class over.

00:08:52.532 --> 00:08:54.467
They say she's living the life.

00:08:54.534 --> 00:08:56.469
She's famous at this nursery.

00:08:57.503 --> 00:09:00.439
See? Her follower count is no joke!

00:09:00.840 --> 00:09:01.841
How wonderful.

00:09:01.908 --> 00:09:04.143
She has the perfect family.

00:09:05.645 --> 00:09:07.113
Good afternoon.

00:09:07.680 --> 00:09:09.515
- Good afternoon!
- Good afternoon!

00:09:09.949 --> 00:09:12.752
My parents in the countryside
sent apples. Please have some.

00:09:14.153 --> 00:09:16.455
- Really?
- Are you sure?

00:09:16.589 --> 00:09:17.590
Of course!

00:09:17.857 --> 00:09:19.559
- Here.
- Goodness!

00:09:19.926 --> 00:09:22.929
- I want some!
- This is so nice.

00:09:23.362 --> 00:09:24.564
Ready?

00:09:24.630 --> 00:09:25.998
- We survived another day!
- We survived another day!

00:09:26.265 --> 00:09:27.833
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

00:09:29.835 --> 00:09:31.604
I can't believe he disappeared.

00:09:31.671 --> 00:09:33.839
What a thorn in your side.

00:09:34.540 --> 00:09:35.775
But honestly

00:09:35.841 --> 00:09:38.277
I'm getting some great sleep
now that he's gone.

00:09:38.578 --> 00:09:39.912
I feel healthier too.

00:09:40.179 --> 00:09:43.049
I get it. I've always wanted that.

00:09:43.115 --> 00:09:45.484
I used to wish
that he'd never come home.

00:09:45.751 --> 00:09:47.353
- Used to.
- Used to.

00:09:49.455 --> 00:09:51.991
But it's weird
he hasn't even turned up at work.

00:09:52.692 --> 00:09:54.293
Do you know where he could be?

00:09:55.094 --> 00:09:56.862
No, not at all.

00:09:57.730 --> 00:10:01.167
I bet he's with his affair.

00:10:02.468 --> 00:10:04.403
That would make sense, right?

00:10:05.738 --> 00:10:07.473
Cheating is an automatic out.

00:10:09.141 --> 00:10:13.346
Well, I don't think
cheating is all bad.

00:10:15.715 --> 00:10:16.749
What?

00:10:16.816 --> 00:10:19.218
I think I'd imagine it
for the rest of my life.

00:10:19.285 --> 00:10:20.686
In bed with another woman

00:10:21.287 --> 00:10:23.723
tangled in each other's arms.

00:10:23.789 --> 00:10:26.292
Don't say that, it's vulgar.

00:10:26.459 --> 00:10:27.460
I'm sorry.

00:10:28.794 --> 00:10:30.663
What are you going to do, Maya?

00:10:31.364 --> 00:10:32.598
Are you getting divorced?

00:10:35.434 --> 00:10:36.435
I don't know.

00:10:37.803 --> 00:10:39.171
Honestly

00:10:39.505 --> 00:10:41.340
my mind is still a mess.

00:10:43.943 --> 00:10:45.077
Of course.

00:10:46.112 --> 00:10:48.814
But don't go through it alone.

00:10:49.515 --> 00:10:51.017
We'll always come to your aid.

00:10:52.652 --> 00:10:55.521
Gosh, that was so cool!

00:10:55.755 --> 00:10:58.691
Did you forget what we did
for you the other day?

00:10:58.824 --> 00:11:00.493
I'm sorry, my bad.

00:11:12.838 --> 00:11:14.674
We didn't go through with it.

00:11:16.308 --> 00:11:17.309
But...

00:11:18.511 --> 00:11:20.579
If anyone here is in trouble

00:11:22.381 --> 00:11:23.783
I'll cooperate, full stop.

00:11:25.484 --> 00:11:26.786
No matter what it takes.

00:11:30.556 --> 00:11:31.824
No matter what?

00:11:44.904 --> 00:11:46.205
The three of us

00:11:47.673 --> 00:11:48.841
can do anything.

00:11:54.613 --> 00:11:56.082
You're so cool!

00:11:56.148 --> 00:11:57.983
Now you're making fun of me?

00:11:58.217 --> 00:11:59.685
Hey, is this ready to eat?

00:12:00.252 --> 00:12:01.721
- Let's eat.
- Oh, right.

00:12:01.921 --> 00:12:03.989
I think it still needs a bit longer.

00:12:04.557 --> 00:12:05.891
"The three of us

00:12:05.958 --> 00:12:07.860
- You're making fun of me.
- can do anything."

00:12:16.068 --> 00:12:17.069
Reina?

00:12:19.138 --> 00:12:21.640
It's been a while. How are you?

00:12:22.408 --> 00:12:25.244
- What?
- You know, I just scouted this kid.

00:12:25.311 --> 00:12:26.712
I'm really pushing for him.

00:12:29.648 --> 00:12:31.917
I'm not sure who this is.

00:12:32.818 --> 00:12:34.353
And who is Reina?

00:12:37.156 --> 00:12:38.157
What?

00:12:38.657 --> 00:12:40.793
Oh, my. I'm so sorry.

00:12:41.060 --> 00:12:42.828
You look just like someone I know.

00:12:43.696 --> 00:12:45.097
I'm really sorry.

00:12:45.331 --> 00:12:46.332
It's fine.

00:12:48.434 --> 00:12:49.568
Excuse me.

00:12:52.505 --> 00:12:54.540
I don't know your story

00:12:55.474 --> 00:12:56.942
but let's do our best.

00:13:01.080 --> 00:13:02.081
Thank you.

00:13:23.369 --> 00:13:24.403
What

00:13:25.771 --> 00:13:26.906
do I want to do?

00:13:29.909 --> 00:13:31.043
Now, looking around...

00:13:32.745 --> 00:13:34.613
A sink full of dirty dishes.

00:13:36.081 --> 00:13:38.551
Toilet paper rolls
he won't throw away.

00:13:39.885 --> 00:13:41.620
Socks left on the floor.

00:13:43.622 --> 00:13:45.958
The air around him
that seemed to reject me.

00:13:47.860 --> 00:13:50.596
My husband and all these things
vanished from my home.

00:13:53.199 --> 00:13:54.400
It feels nice.

00:13:58.871 --> 00:13:59.872
So much space.

00:14:00.906 --> 00:14:02.975
Do I want my husband back?

00:14:05.277 --> 00:14:06.378
I...

00:14:07.780 --> 00:14:08.914
don't feel that I do.

00:14:11.150 --> 00:14:13.018
If only you'd just die!

00:14:13.552 --> 00:14:14.687
Those words...

00:14:15.654 --> 00:14:17.656
If they became reality...

00:14:19.558 --> 00:14:20.593
does that mean

00:14:22.061 --> 00:14:24.430
that I killed my husband?

00:14:30.469 --> 00:14:31.637
I'm home!

00:14:32.838 --> 00:14:34.240
Welcome back!

00:14:35.474 --> 00:14:37.243
You're still up, Yuna?

00:14:37.543 --> 00:14:38.544
Where's Dad?

00:14:38.677 --> 00:14:39.879
He's sleeping.

00:14:41.013 --> 00:14:44.049
I can't believe this.

00:14:44.550 --> 00:14:46.352
Hey, wake up.

00:14:47.052 --> 00:14:48.053
Mom.

00:14:48.187 --> 00:14:50.189
He'll get mad at you again.

00:14:51.624 --> 00:14:52.958
It's okay.

00:14:53.425 --> 00:14:56.662
Yuna, Dad is a good man now.

00:14:57.229 --> 00:14:58.964
What? A good man?

00:14:59.999 --> 00:15:02.735
He's not the old dad
who would always get mad.

00:15:03.269 --> 00:15:05.037
So it's okay.

00:15:05.638 --> 00:15:07.339
- Really?
- Yes.

00:15:10.576 --> 00:15:12.244
Hey, wake up.

00:15:13.679 --> 00:15:16.382
Hey, let me sleep a bit more.

00:15:16.548 --> 00:15:17.549
What?

00:15:19.685 --> 00:15:20.686
I'm sorry.

00:15:21.453 --> 00:15:24.323
Put Yuna to sleep, not yourself.

00:15:25.224 --> 00:15:26.225
I'm sorry, Yuna.

00:15:26.759 --> 00:15:28.027
Let's head to bed.

00:15:30.396 --> 00:15:33.365
CRIMINAL INVESTIGATION FOR SUICIDES

00:15:33.432 --> 00:15:36.235
INCITING SUICIDE CAN BE PUNISHABLE

00:15:36.302 --> 00:15:41.240
WITH PRISON TIME OR HARD LABOR
FROM SIX MONTHS TO SEVEN YEARS

00:15:51.317 --> 00:15:52.818
I wish he would just die.

00:15:53.452 --> 00:15:54.787
Is this seat open?

00:15:55.321 --> 00:15:56.322
Go ahead.

00:15:57.256 --> 00:15:58.324
What's wrong, Kana?

00:15:59.325 --> 00:16:01.260
It's the section chief.

00:16:01.994 --> 00:16:05.297
He skipped an important client
meeting and went to the salon.

00:16:05.764 --> 00:16:07.066
Can you believe it?

00:16:09.301 --> 00:16:13.272
Oh, since the reporters are covering
this weekend's opening event?

00:16:13.605 --> 00:16:14.807
Exactly.

00:16:16.842 --> 00:16:19.478
I got yelled at because of him.

00:16:22.081 --> 00:16:23.382
I wish he'd just die.

00:16:26.118 --> 00:16:28.821
That's usually how it feels
when you say "die," right?

00:16:30.089 --> 00:16:31.090
What?

00:16:32.624 --> 00:16:35.361
We throw it around pretty casually.

00:16:35.794 --> 00:16:38.831
Well, I guess so.

00:16:39.498 --> 00:16:43.268
I guess it's what we say
when we're the angriest or upset.

00:16:45.337 --> 00:16:48.474
But people don't say it
to their faces, obviously.

00:16:50.309 --> 00:16:51.343
That's true.

00:16:53.178 --> 00:16:54.880
Did you say it to someone?

00:16:54.947 --> 00:16:56.181
Well, no.

00:16:57.783 --> 00:17:00.919
I'd just feel bad
if someone said that to me.

00:17:02.021 --> 00:17:03.022
That's true.

00:17:03.422 --> 00:17:05.958
I might want to die
if someone close to me said it.

00:17:26.078 --> 00:17:27.513
It's Noa!

00:17:27.813 --> 00:17:29.548
Hello, Yuna.

00:17:29.615 --> 00:17:30.682
Hello.

00:17:31.817 --> 00:17:33.118
What are you doing?

00:17:33.185 --> 00:17:34.319
We're playing.

00:17:41.693 --> 00:17:42.828
My husband said

00:17:43.529 --> 00:17:45.931
"Do what makes you happy, Emi."

00:17:48.300 --> 00:17:51.003
Was your husband always like that?

00:17:51.070 --> 00:17:52.671
Oh, not at all.

00:17:53.205 --> 00:17:55.274
He changed slowly after we married.

00:17:59.411 --> 00:18:02.114
How do I raise him
to be a better husband?

00:18:03.782 --> 00:18:04.850
"Raise him"?

00:18:06.351 --> 00:18:09.321
That's a funny way to put it, Yurika.

00:18:09.555 --> 00:18:10.556
I'm sorry.

00:18:12.124 --> 00:18:13.425
But let's see...

00:18:14.827 --> 00:18:16.662
I think self-confidence is key.

00:18:18.397 --> 00:18:22.534
You need to show your husband
that you're worth being cared for.

00:18:24.136 --> 00:18:25.304
I see.

00:18:26.238 --> 00:18:29.608
Don't hold back,
just because he's making the money.

00:18:30.976 --> 00:18:34.413
We risked our lives to give birth.

00:18:35.881 --> 00:18:38.117
Let him spoil you
like you deserve it.

00:18:39.318 --> 00:18:42.988
Your husband will start
to respect you naturally.

00:18:46.258 --> 00:18:47.526
I'll remember that.

00:19:00.038 --> 00:19:01.039
Coke highball.

00:19:01.406 --> 00:19:02.441
Coming right up.

00:19:05.244 --> 00:19:06.645
Are you alone today?

00:19:07.079 --> 00:19:08.113
What?

00:19:08.547 --> 00:19:10.782
- Good evening.
- Hello.

00:19:10.849 --> 00:19:12.684
You had two friends the other day.

00:19:14.653 --> 00:19:16.788
I remember
because you were having so much fun.

00:19:16.855 --> 00:19:18.357
Gosh, were we too loud?

00:19:18.423 --> 00:19:20.526
- I'm sorry.
- No, not at all.

00:19:21.193 --> 00:19:23.128
Your sisterly bond seemed nice.

00:19:25.297 --> 00:19:26.398
Thank you for waiting.

00:19:28.700 --> 00:19:31.870
But you seem kind of down today.

00:19:33.238 --> 00:19:34.239
What?

00:19:34.907 --> 00:19:35.908
I'm sorry.

00:19:35.974 --> 00:19:37.042
I was just curious.

00:19:38.844 --> 00:19:39.978
It's just...

00:19:41.246 --> 00:19:43.515
I'm having trouble
figuring something out.

00:19:46.018 --> 00:19:48.554
Then shall I help clear things up?

00:19:51.323 --> 00:19:52.758
If you can.

00:19:55.961 --> 00:19:56.962
Your hand.

00:19:57.262 --> 00:19:58.430
Can I see it?

00:19:59.231 --> 00:20:00.966
- What? Oh, sure.
- Yes.

00:20:04.403 --> 00:20:05.571
Those are nice lines.

00:20:05.637 --> 00:20:06.939
Really?

00:20:09.608 --> 00:20:11.944
Things will go
the way you want them to.

00:20:12.311 --> 00:20:14.813
Wow, you can read palms?

00:20:15.047 --> 00:20:16.949
No, I just tried playing the part.

00:20:17.182 --> 00:20:19.651
Hey, you can't read palms?

00:20:21.386 --> 00:20:24.056
But I think it's true
for the most part.

00:20:25.190 --> 00:20:27.492
That's based on my intuition though.

00:20:28.393 --> 00:20:29.394
What?

00:20:30.963 --> 00:20:32.264
You can't figure out

00:20:33.198 --> 00:20:35.234
what you really want.

00:20:36.301 --> 00:20:37.302
Am I right?

00:20:43.308 --> 00:20:44.943
There I go again.

00:20:45.811 --> 00:20:48.146
- I'm sorry for getting carried away.
- Not at all.

00:20:48.714 --> 00:20:49.781
He's right.

00:20:50.315 --> 00:20:52.985
Do I really want my husband to live?

00:20:57.022 --> 00:20:58.123
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

00:21:06.498 --> 00:21:10.502
We used to drink together like this
once a week, as a couple.

00:21:10.836 --> 00:21:11.937
Really?

00:21:12.237 --> 00:21:13.705
We must've gotten along.

00:21:14.139 --> 00:21:16.642
Then, you would shut your mouth

00:21:16.708 --> 00:21:19.478
and have fun listening to me talk.

00:21:20.012 --> 00:21:21.380
Really?

00:21:23.548 --> 00:21:25.250
I don't mean to brag

00:21:26.084 --> 00:21:27.819
but I must be a great husband.

00:21:53.145 --> 00:21:55.714
Hey, you should've boiled it.

00:21:56.581 --> 00:21:58.917
It tastes bad
when you cut corners like that.

00:22:06.224 --> 00:22:07.225
Hey.

00:22:07.693 --> 00:22:09.261
Don't use the microwave.

00:22:09.494 --> 00:22:11.663
Take the time to actually cook it.

00:22:12.331 --> 00:22:13.332
What?

00:22:13.732 --> 00:22:15.701
It tastes better like that.

00:22:15.767 --> 00:22:17.969
That's what you always said to me.

00:22:18.603 --> 00:22:19.604
I did?

00:22:22.407 --> 00:22:24.710
Don't force yourself to remember.

00:22:24.943 --> 00:22:26.945
Just make sure you do it from now on.

00:22:27.679 --> 00:22:29.448
Yes, thank you.

00:22:30.115 --> 00:22:31.149
It's fine for today.

00:22:31.516 --> 00:22:33.418
- Come on, sit down.
- Okay.

00:22:37.923 --> 00:22:38.924
Hey!

00:22:39.624 --> 00:22:40.625
Yes?

00:22:40.692 --> 00:22:41.860
That's all you have to say?

00:22:42.227 --> 00:22:43.528
My glass!

00:22:44.029 --> 00:22:45.364
It's empty, so pour.

00:22:47.099 --> 00:22:48.100
Okay.

00:22:51.870 --> 00:22:53.672
My glass.

00:22:54.940 --> 00:22:55.941
Yes?

00:22:56.241 --> 00:22:57.743
That's all you have to say?

00:22:57.809 --> 00:22:59.478
You have to pour for me.

00:23:07.486 --> 00:23:10.322
Next time, pour it
before I have to say it.

00:23:10.689 --> 00:23:12.224
- Got it?
- Yes.

00:23:13.258 --> 00:23:14.626
Understood.

00:23:19.965 --> 00:23:20.966
Allow me.

00:24:08.780 --> 00:24:10.582
Maya, welcome home.

00:24:11.016 --> 00:24:12.017
Mother.

00:24:12.250 --> 00:24:13.485
You're home late.

00:24:15.954 --> 00:24:17.022
Wait.

00:24:17.656 --> 00:24:18.657
Oh, my.

00:24:18.990 --> 00:24:20.325
Were you drinking?

00:24:23.929 --> 00:24:25.263
Why are you here?

00:24:25.564 --> 00:24:28.133
I couldn't get in touch
with Mitsuhiro, so I got worried.

00:24:28.700 --> 00:24:29.968
And no one was home.

00:24:31.736 --> 00:24:32.737
The lock.

00:24:32.938 --> 00:24:34.206
I obviously have a key.

00:24:35.173 --> 00:24:36.842
Anyway, where is Mitsuhiro?

00:24:43.849 --> 00:24:46.084
He's been missing for five days?

00:24:47.619 --> 00:24:48.620
Yes.

00:24:49.254 --> 00:24:50.422
You can't be serious.

00:24:50.822 --> 00:24:51.823
You...

00:24:52.424 --> 00:24:54.993
Why didn't you tell me
something this important?

00:24:56.595 --> 00:24:57.596
I apologize.

00:24:57.963 --> 00:24:58.964
And the police?

00:24:59.865 --> 00:25:01.099
- What?
- The police.

00:25:03.101 --> 00:25:04.102
You didn't report it?

00:25:06.505 --> 00:25:07.839
I can't believe this.

00:25:08.874 --> 00:25:10.642
He's been gone for days.

00:25:11.510 --> 00:25:13.245
Have you lost your mind?

00:25:13.411 --> 00:25:15.981
Mother, you'll bother the neighbors.

00:25:17.415 --> 00:25:18.416
Don't tell me.

00:25:19.384 --> 00:25:20.819
Did you do something wrong?

00:25:22.254 --> 00:25:23.522
What do you mean?

00:25:24.856 --> 00:25:27.425
Did you do something to Mitsuhiro?

00:25:27.659 --> 00:25:29.928
- That's why you didn't report it.
- Of course not!

00:25:30.595 --> 00:25:32.430
- He's the one who--
- What?

00:25:35.500 --> 00:25:36.701
- Nothing.
- Listen.

00:25:38.103 --> 00:25:40.071
Go to the police tomorrow.

00:25:41.573 --> 00:25:44.409
If anything happened to him

00:25:45.677 --> 00:25:47.112
I'll never forgive you!

00:25:51.216 --> 00:25:53.151
Your son cheated on me.

00:25:54.953 --> 00:25:58.957
But saying that
would only add fuel to the fire.

00:26:07.232 --> 00:26:11.703
From the start, Mitsuhiro's mom
never seemed to like me.

00:26:21.146 --> 00:26:22.981
Are you sure about him?

00:26:23.715 --> 00:26:24.849
Oh, please.

00:26:25.283 --> 00:26:28.887
Well, I told him
you don't have to rush into marriage.

00:26:30.155 --> 00:26:32.023
- Yes.
- Give it some thought.

00:26:32.557 --> 00:26:35.193
Let me know if you change your mind.

00:26:38.663 --> 00:26:42.067
My brother is always
spacing out like this.

00:26:42.534 --> 00:26:46.571
If he's not what you thought,
you can hand him back to us anytime.

00:26:47.939 --> 00:26:49.541
"Not what you thought"?

00:26:52.344 --> 00:26:53.411
He's so weird.

00:27:12.263 --> 00:27:13.331
After the wedding

00:27:13.898 --> 00:27:16.334
she pushed for a baby quite openly.

00:27:19.337 --> 00:27:21.606
But I didn't show any interest

00:27:22.674 --> 00:27:25.310
which made her hate
for me grow stronger.

00:27:33.051 --> 00:27:38.089
She'll just blame me
for my husband's affair anyway.

00:27:42.627 --> 00:27:43.828
An affair?

00:27:44.462 --> 00:27:46.698
It's your fault
for only caring about work!

00:27:46.765 --> 00:27:49.434
It's all because
you never had a baby!

00:27:55.940 --> 00:27:59.277
KAJIWARA POLICE DEPARTMENT

00:28:04.849 --> 00:28:06.051
Excuse me.

00:28:07.752 --> 00:28:08.753
Coming.

00:28:12.023 --> 00:28:14.092
He's missed work since Monday?

00:28:16.528 --> 00:28:17.529
Yes.

00:28:18.129 --> 00:28:19.164
Any leads?

00:28:20.498 --> 00:28:21.599
Not really.

00:28:26.538 --> 00:28:29.474
Did any of his belongings disappear?

00:28:31.409 --> 00:28:32.911
His wallet

00:28:33.778 --> 00:28:34.946
his phone

00:28:36.081 --> 00:28:39.484
and the laptop
he always carries around.

00:28:41.119 --> 00:28:43.588
What about his clothes and shoes?

00:28:43.922 --> 00:28:46.991
Or his bankbook and insurance card?

00:28:48.293 --> 00:28:50.061
His bankbook was at home

00:28:50.829 --> 00:28:52.964
but I don't know
if he has other funds.

00:28:54.566 --> 00:28:57.836
I think he carries around
his insurance card.

00:28:58.303 --> 00:28:59.304
I see.

00:29:04.909 --> 00:29:05.910
In that case

00:29:06.578 --> 00:29:09.080
I'll file this
as a missing person case.

00:29:10.715 --> 00:29:12.984
What would that entail?

00:29:14.285 --> 00:29:15.787
It means he ran away.

00:29:18.389 --> 00:29:21.526
Well, I'm sure he'll turn up again
out of the blue.

00:29:22.026 --> 00:29:23.628
Let's wait and see.

00:29:25.530 --> 00:29:26.631
Okay.

00:29:27.098 --> 00:29:28.099
Thank you.

00:29:48.787 --> 00:29:50.722
Taking it easy again, Mr. Shimura?

00:29:52.824 --> 00:29:54.592
Something smells off.

00:29:55.693 --> 00:29:56.694
You think?

00:29:59.097 --> 00:30:00.732
I've got allergies, so I can't tell.

00:30:03.434 --> 00:30:05.003
EXPENSES EXPLAINED BY A LAWYER

00:30:05.069 --> 00:30:07.338
If they're gone for three years

00:30:07.639 --> 00:30:10.508
and their living status is unknown

00:30:11.109 --> 00:30:13.611
- you're officially divorced.
- Dad.

00:30:14.012 --> 00:30:15.013
- Three years...
- Dad.

00:30:15.313 --> 00:30:17.649
- Yuna, how do you use this?
- Here's what I think.

00:30:17.715 --> 00:30:19.384
- If you want a divorce
- Give it a try.

00:30:19.450 --> 00:30:20.652
the best way would be

00:30:20.718 --> 00:30:23.021
- to find him and talk it out.
- Put it up to your ear.

00:30:23.488 --> 00:30:26.224
The police aren't looking, right?

00:30:29.060 --> 00:30:32.463
Are you second-guessing the divorce?

00:30:33.364 --> 00:30:34.999
Or rather...

00:30:37.035 --> 00:30:39.470
I have no idea what's happening.

00:30:43.975 --> 00:30:46.945
Living without Mitsuhiro
is comfortable

00:30:48.379 --> 00:30:52.584
but I'm not sure what I want to do.

00:30:55.453 --> 00:30:56.554
Right.

00:30:57.589 --> 00:31:00.558
But you should still
get things ready.

00:31:02.460 --> 00:31:03.461
Get things ready?

00:31:05.330 --> 00:31:07.398
Like proof of the affair.

00:31:07.932 --> 00:31:11.336
Make it clear
that he's the one at fault.

00:31:17.842 --> 00:31:19.143
Proof of the affair...

00:31:21.579 --> 00:31:23.281
Do you know who it could be?

00:31:25.550 --> 00:31:27.185
Not at all.

00:31:29.420 --> 00:31:32.023
Maybe I should hire an investigator.

00:31:36.361 --> 00:31:38.363
Has Riko contacted you?

00:31:39.397 --> 00:31:40.398
No.

00:31:41.065 --> 00:31:42.367
Really?

00:31:43.668 --> 00:31:45.536
She'll be more help than I'll be.

00:31:46.304 --> 00:31:47.472
You should ask her.

00:31:48.840 --> 00:31:49.841
Yes.

00:31:51.109 --> 00:31:52.210
Good idea.

00:31:52.644 --> 00:31:53.645
Thank you.

00:32:08.993 --> 00:32:10.261
Proof of the affair.

00:32:16.901 --> 00:32:19.871
The perfume
that was on those blankets...

00:32:23.808 --> 00:32:24.809
Who was it?

00:33:00.144 --> 00:33:04.549
NEW EMAIL

00:33:04.615 --> 00:33:06.951
FROM MITSUHIRO KOMOTO

00:33:08.252 --> 00:33:09.354
Mitsuhiro.

00:33:19.797 --> 00:33:20.798
What?

00:33:21.432 --> 00:33:22.433
Riko?

00:33:25.570 --> 00:33:26.571
Why?

00:33:27.972 --> 00:33:28.973
I'm sorry.

00:33:29.374 --> 00:33:30.375
I...

00:33:30.641 --> 00:33:33.411
I don't think cheating
is all that bad.

00:33:33.478 --> 00:33:35.480
Sunday might be tough.

00:33:35.680 --> 00:33:37.949
If I told you
that I'm killing my husband

00:33:38.149 --> 00:33:39.217
would you help me?

00:33:39.450 --> 00:33:40.918
You two are terrifying.

00:33:41.052 --> 00:33:42.487
- Here goes.
- Really?

00:33:42.553 --> 00:33:44.789
- Three, two, one.
- Do it properly.

00:34:15.219 --> 00:34:17.021
Mitsuhiro was cheating on me with...

00:34:27.565 --> 00:34:28.566
Riko.

00:35:18.749 --> 00:35:20.084
Why are you here?

00:35:20.785 --> 00:35:22.120
Weren't you coming tomorrow?

00:35:23.721 --> 00:35:25.756
I missed you, so I came a day early.

00:35:28.025 --> 00:35:30.495
- Hey, that's mine.
- Yes.

00:35:30.561 --> 00:35:32.330
- Stop. Give it back.
- Why?

00:35:33.631 --> 00:35:35.233
But you have nothing to hide.

00:35:37.401 --> 00:35:38.402
But still...

00:35:43.407 --> 00:35:45.810
Your texts to other people
are curt too, huh?

00:35:45.877 --> 00:35:47.578
Give it back already.

00:35:50.681 --> 00:35:51.749
What...

00:35:54.085 --> 00:35:55.086
is this?

00:35:56.554 --> 00:35:58.890
Heart rate rising.

00:36:28.019 --> 00:36:29.020
Riko?

00:36:29.921 --> 00:36:30.922
Riko!

00:36:31.989 --> 00:36:33.424
Are you okay, Riko?

00:37:54.372 --> 00:37:55.373
I love you.

00:37:55.806 --> 00:37:57.608
Riko!

00:37:57.675 --> 00:37:59.043
Good evening, I'm Hiroki.

00:37:59.243 --> 00:38:00.244
Thank you for waiting.

00:38:00.444 --> 00:38:03.381
At long last,
you'll see my rampage next week.

00:38:03.581 --> 00:38:08.052
I'll do my best on stage
to meet your expectations

00:38:08.119 --> 00:38:09.120
so look forward to it.

00:38:09.420 --> 00:38:11.055
I never lied to you.

00:38:11.122 --> 00:38:12.990
It might be an impersonation.

00:38:13.057 --> 00:38:15.760
- An impersonation?
- Are you hiding something?

00:38:15.926 --> 00:38:20.498
Is there a secret hiding
behind my husband's disappearance?

00:38:20.564 --> 00:38:23.000
Next week on Please Die My Beloved.

00:38:23.067 --> 00:38:25.236
A trio of lies.

00:38:25.603 --> 00:38:27.872
My heart rate continues to rise.
