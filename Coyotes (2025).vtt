<i>And I was like, "Bitch,
if you don't send me black car</i>

01:02.959 --> 01:04.064
<i>I'm walking.</i>

01:04.167 --> 01:05.617
<i>Oh, my God, so true.</i>

01:05.720 --> 01:06.411
<i>He got one for Isabelle.</i>

01:06.514 --> 01:07.550
Oh, my God, I know, right?

01:07.653 --> 01:09.379
And did you see
how he was looking at her?

01:09.483 --> 01:10.380
<i>Oh, I
saw. Gross.</i>

01:10.484 --> 01:12.279
Gigi, go.

01:12.382 --> 01:15.558
Go.

01:15.661 --> 01:17.594
Did you notice how everyone
started dancing

01:17.698 --> 01:19.079
after we hit the floor?

01:19.182 --> 01:20.218
<i>Oh, yeah.</i>

01:20.321 --> 01:21.357
I felt like I was hosting
the entire club.

01:21.460 --> 01:23.221
I mean, what, I said hi
to like, three people,

01:23.324 --> 01:24.532
and then all of a sudden
it was like,

01:24.636 --> 01:26.327
“Oh my God,
come hang out with us,”

01:26.431 --> 01:28.053
or like, “Can we join you?”

01:28.157 --> 01:29.744
It was like, dead
before we showed up.

01:29.848 --> 01:32.022
Gigi, walk.

01:32.126 --> 01:34.266
Bitch, go.

01:34.370 --> 01:36.096
It's exhausting being this hot.

01:36.199 --> 01:37.235
<i>I know.</i>

01:37.338 --> 01:39.168
Oh my God, I'm so done
with this dog.

01:39.271 --> 01:40.617
<i>Oh my God, I love your dog.</i>

01:40.721 --> 01:42.102
I swear it's not even
intentional.

01:42.205 --> 01:44.621
People just like,
follow my vibe.

01:44.725 --> 01:45.484
Is that a thing?

01:45.588 --> 01:47.521
Like natural rhythm
or something?

01:47.624 --> 01:48.867
<i>I don't think</i>

01:48.970 --> 01:49.971
<i>it was just your vibe.</i>

01:50.075 --> 01:52.836
Oh, shut up, skank.
I'm just magnetic.

01:52.940 --> 01:53.941
<i>Um, Kat.</i>

01:54.044 --> 01:55.184
<i>Tommy just showed up
outside my door.</i>

01:55.287 --> 01:57.496
<i>Whoa, he's looking fine.</i>

01:57.600 --> 01:59.360
Wait, seriously?

01:59.464 --> 02:00.327
<i>Mm-hm, yeah.</i>

02:00.430 --> 02:01.500
<i>- I gotta go.</i>
- Good luck.

02:01.604 --> 02:03.778
Oh, and hey,
don't get chlamydia.

02:03.882 --> 02:05.055
I've heard rumors.

02:05.159 --> 02:06.471
<i>Ew, what the fuck.</i>

02:07.403 --> 02:08.714
Bitch.

02:19.967 --> 02:20.864
Ew.

02:24.868 --> 02:26.387
Gigi, go potty now.

02:27.388 --> 02:28.389
Come on, bitch.

02:28.493 --> 02:30.253
Mommy is tired
and coming down hard.

02:30.357 --> 02:31.530
Let's go binge something.

02:34.982 --> 02:36.742
Ugh. Seriously?

02:36.846 --> 02:38.434
Never rains in LA.

02:50.170 --> 02:52.517
What the hell?

02:52.620 --> 02:55.105
Baby. Chill.

02:58.833 --> 03:00.421
Gigi?

03:08.498 --> 03:10.293
Baby. Mommy's coming.

03:10.397 --> 03:13.572
Oh, my God. Gigi!

03:14.573 --> 03:17.231
<i>Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.</i>

03:18.370 --> 03:19.992
You fucking bitch! Bitch!

03:20.096 --> 03:23.099
You killed my Gigi.
You killed--

03:56.063 --> 03:58.445
Fucking coyotes.

04:35.827 --> 04:37.069
<i>Did anybody hear about the</i>

04:37.173 --> 04:38.347
<i>social media influencer</i>

04:38.450 --> 04:40.452
<i>that became roadkill last night?</i>

04:42.005 --> 04:43.938
<i>Another coyote
attack this morning,</i>

04:44.042 --> 04:46.044
<i>this one in Sherman Oaks.</i>

04:46.147 --> 04:48.184
<i>Why do you think
this keeps happening?</i>

04:48.288 --> 04:50.117
<i>Well, for one,
coyotes aren't picky eaters.</i>

04:50.220 --> 04:51.739
<i>They're opportunistic
predators.</i>

04:51.843 --> 04:52.844
<i>They're not above nipping at you</i>

04:52.947 --> 04:55.087
<i>to send a message
if they feel threatened.</i>

05:13.796 --> 05:15.970
<i>Wildfires
are pushing coyotes deeper</i>

05:16.074 --> 05:18.076
<i>into Los Angeles neighborhoods.</i>

05:18.179 --> 05:19.388
<i>They're desperate.</i>

05:19.491 --> 05:21.044
<i>They're going to do
what they have to do</i>

05:21.148 --> 05:23.046
<i>to survive.</i>

05:41.893 --> 05:44.965
<i>A boy was pulled off his
bike on a residential street.</i>

05:45.068 --> 05:47.105
<i>Did that actually happen?</i>

06:38.639 --> 06:41.055
Goddamn
Hollywood elites.

06:52.895 --> 06:55.311
We've got rats in the walls?

06:55.415 --> 06:56.830
Oh, yeah.

06:56.933 --> 06:58.763
Yeah. Rats will spawn six
to 12 a litter,

06:58.866 --> 07:00.040
with up to six litters a year.

07:00.143 --> 07:03.423
That's 60 rats, right there,
all from one big mama rat.

07:03.526 --> 07:05.942
But--but how?
It's a new house.

07:08.186 --> 07:10.050
<i>Well, look around.</i>
Yeah.

07:10.153 --> 07:15.055
Contractors use cheap drywall,
plastic instead of copper,

07:15.158 --> 07:16.056
and rats...

07:16.159 --> 07:19.128
rats will chew through
just about anything.

07:19.231 --> 07:22.200
Yeah, you got doggy doors,
water and gas lines.

07:22.303 --> 07:23.166
Nice family.

07:23.270 --> 07:24.305
Thanks.

07:24.409 --> 07:26.446
<i>Yeah, drains,
toilet vents.</i>

07:26.549 --> 07:28.344
Trust me when I say
you do not want

07:28.448 --> 07:29.587
one of those nasty
little critters

07:29.690 --> 07:30.933
climbing out of your toilet.

07:31.036 --> 07:31.830
Ugh, yeah.

07:31.934 --> 07:33.176
I don't even want
to think about that.

07:33.280 --> 07:34.177
Then don't.

07:34.281 --> 07:36.939
Look. Rats are vermin.
- Right.

07:37.042 --> 07:38.527
They're a disease.

07:38.630 --> 07:41.184
They want your shelter,
your food, your water,

07:41.288 --> 07:43.566
your happiness, your sanity.

07:43.670 --> 07:45.741
And they wiggle
their little bodies

07:45.844 --> 07:47.984
through any nook
or cranny they can find

07:48.088 --> 07:49.054
until they get it.

07:51.091 --> 07:52.817
Okay.

07:52.920 --> 07:56.441
So what do we--what do we do?

07:56.545 --> 07:58.063
Do you really have
to poison them?

07:58.167 --> 08:00.376
Can't you just, like,
trap them and, like,

08:00.480 --> 08:01.929
relocate them to the desert
or something?

08:02.033 --> 08:05.346
Oh, yeah. Make them nice little
suitcases and bath towels?

08:05.450 --> 08:08.557
No. You don't send them
to a day spa.

08:08.660 --> 08:10.524
You gotta wipe them out.

08:10.628 --> 08:14.010
Send a message to all the
other rats in the area.

08:14.114 --> 08:18.428
This house right here
is off limits.

08:18.532 --> 08:20.085
Right.

08:20.189 --> 08:24.089
Just thinking like,
are rats even that bad?

08:32.408 --> 08:35.825
You ever hear of a little thing
called the Black Plague?

08:35.929 --> 08:40.658
Millions and millions
of people dying horribly,

08:40.761 --> 08:44.144
bleeding out of their eyes,
their ears, their a--

08:44.247 --> 08:46.422
I got it. Rats bad.

08:46.526 --> 08:48.044
Poison good.

08:52.532 --> 08:54.568
Oh, this is not good, Scott.

08:54.672 --> 08:58.227
Oh.

08:58.330 --> 09:02.403
But now that...
that's your biggest problem.

09:02.507 --> 09:05.614
That's like a rat paradise.

09:05.717 --> 09:08.444
That's my neighbor's yard.

09:08.548 --> 09:12.448
I'll go ahead
and spray it anyway.

09:12.552 --> 09:13.725
You're welcome.

09:13.829 --> 09:17.695
No, no. It's my--
I don't own that part.

09:17.798 --> 09:20.490
Is he a customer?

09:20.594 --> 09:22.044
<i>He's soon to be.</i>

09:37.991 --> 09:39.061
Hey, Chloe.

09:39.164 --> 09:40.165
Little help, please?

09:43.479 --> 09:45.170
Wasn't going with you enough?

09:47.103 --> 09:48.760
No, it wasn't.
And that's rude.

09:48.864 --> 09:50.486
Come on, come help.

09:50.590 --> 09:51.867
Come on.

09:54.041 --> 09:55.905
What's with the attitude, huh?

09:56.009 --> 09:58.667
It's like this
happened overnight.

09:58.770 --> 10:01.566
So then she ghosted me,
moved to Turkey or something.

10:01.670 --> 10:05.087
<i>Oh, man.</i>
Oh, that sucks.

10:05.190 --> 10:07.192
Sorry. Just to go back
to what we were saying earlier

10:07.296 --> 10:09.678
about the pricing plan.
So you said there's like--

10:09.781 --> 10:12.301
My dad fell down the stairs,
had a stroke.

10:15.235 --> 10:17.064
We're back. Finally.

10:17.168 --> 10:17.962
Hey, kid.

10:18.065 --> 10:19.549
Charlie's psyched to see you.

10:19.653 --> 10:21.413
We got rats in the walls.

10:21.517 --> 10:23.381
Oh, I told you there's rats.

10:23.484 --> 10:25.901
I saw one squirming under the
garage door the other night.

10:26.004 --> 10:28.938
It was gross.
- Yeah, I'm already on it.

10:29.042 --> 10:30.906
<i>He's also gonna set
Trip's house on fire</i> for us.

10:31.009 --> 10:32.493
Oh, good.
It's an eyesore.

10:32.597 --> 10:33.529
Do us a favor.

10:38.534 --> 10:39.742
Afraid I can't help you there.

10:39.846 --> 10:40.709
<i>Oh, I was just kidding.</i>

10:40.812 --> 10:43.056
<i>Well, that's my time.</i>

10:43.159 --> 10:44.782
Alrighty.

10:44.885 --> 10:48.026
Well, I'm gonna set some traps,
do some spraying,

10:48.130 --> 10:50.960
and I'll be back in a few days
to check everything out.

10:51.064 --> 10:53.031
Okay. Thanks a lot, Devon.

10:53.135 --> 10:56.586
- Oh, one more thing.
- Yeah.

10:56.690 --> 11:00.211
Oh. Rats love dog food.

11:00.314 --> 11:04.733
So you might want to get rid
of the, uh, the dog.

11:04.836 --> 11:06.562
<i>The dog food?</i>

11:06.666 --> 11:07.908
The dog.

11:08.012 --> 11:12.810
No.
No, that's okay.

11:12.913 --> 11:14.708
You let me know.
No extra charge.

11:14.812 --> 11:16.089
No, but no.

11:16.192 --> 11:19.092
That's not even--
so no on that.

11:20.887 --> 11:24.028
Did he say he was gonna
get rid of the dog?

11:24.131 --> 11:26.271
Think he was kidding.

11:26.375 --> 11:27.445
That's weird.

11:27.548 --> 11:28.929
And creepy.

11:29.033 --> 11:30.482
He's just passionate
about what he does.

11:30.586 --> 11:31.691
He came highly recommended.

11:31.794 --> 11:33.727
Oh shit.

11:33.831 --> 11:36.488
Okay, I'll be in my office.

11:36.592 --> 11:37.766
Good to see you.

11:47.879 --> 11:48.811
It was a rare encounter,

11:48.915 --> 11:51.020
but there was a Scott sighting.

11:51.124 --> 11:52.746
He's almost done
with his deadline, honey.

11:52.850 --> 11:54.299
We'll have more time
with him soon.

11:54.403 --> 11:55.507
Sure we will.

11:55.611 --> 11:57.233
We will. I promise.

11:58.752 --> 12:00.374
Where's the candy?

12:00.478 --> 12:01.686
<i>The National Weather Service</i>

12:01.790 --> 12:03.826
<i>has issued another
red flag warning</i>

12:03.930 --> 12:06.518
<i>with gusts expected to reach up
to 60 miles per hour</i>

12:12.455 --> 12:13.456
<i>Hey.</i>

12:13.560 --> 12:14.803
What's up?

12:14.906 --> 12:17.978
Um... are you at all worried
about the tree out front?

12:18.082 --> 12:19.566
Because they just said
that the storm

12:19.669 --> 12:21.637
was going to be really
crazy tonight,

12:21.741 --> 12:26.159
and you did say that you were
going to trim it last year.

12:26.262 --> 12:27.781
No, it's fine.

12:27.885 --> 12:29.300
It's going to be fine.

12:32.372 --> 12:33.338
Okay.

12:34.892 --> 12:36.410
I'm not worried.

12:36.514 --> 12:37.791
Yeah.

12:37.895 --> 12:38.723
<i>They always try
to make shit sound worse</i>

12:38.827 --> 12:40.311
than it is on the news.

12:40.414 --> 12:41.726
Remember the killer bees?

12:41.830 --> 12:42.969
Remember how long we heard
about them?

12:43.072 --> 12:43.970
-  <i>Mm-hm.</i>
- When I was a kid,

12:44.073 --> 12:45.730
I was afraid of all bees.

12:45.834 --> 12:47.559
Ever seen one killer bee?

12:47.663 --> 12:49.561
Did anyone ever die from a bee?

12:49.665 --> 12:51.771
I mean, that wasn't allergic.

12:51.874 --> 12:55.913
No. I'm not worried.
-  Okay.

12:56.016 --> 12:57.846
It's fine.
It's gonna be fine.

12:59.433 --> 13:00.849
<i>If you say</i> so.

13:00.952 --> 13:03.161
- I know so.
-  All right.

13:03.265 --> 13:04.335
Okay.

13:11.929 --> 13:13.206
Okay.

13:14.690 --> 13:17.141
Can we not do movie night?

13:17.244 --> 13:18.798
It's cringe.

13:18.901 --> 13:20.696
I thought
you loved movie night.

13:20.800 --> 13:22.180
Not anymore.

13:27.703 --> 13:29.739
-  <i>Scott, pizza's here.</i>
- Got it.

13:38.783 --> 13:41.682
You're young.

13:41.786 --> 13:44.030
And you're not the pizza.

13:44.133 --> 13:48.482
No, I'm not a pizza.

13:48.586 --> 13:50.657
Unless you want me to be one?

13:55.627 --> 13:59.321
Uh...
Wait, is this...1202?

13:59.424 --> 14:01.564
<i>Nope.
This is 1208.</i>

14:01.668 --> 14:03.739
That's 1202.

14:03.843 --> 14:05.154
Shit!

14:05.258 --> 14:08.571
Shoot. I mean, uh... sorry.

14:08.675 --> 14:09.849
So sorry.

14:12.886 --> 14:14.508
Fuck me!
It's windy out here.

14:16.200 --> 14:17.787
Oh, my God, why?

14:17.891 --> 14:19.237
Where's the--where's the pizza?

14:19.341 --> 14:20.652
That wasn't it.
That was--

14:20.756 --> 14:21.999
It was one of Trip's whores.

14:22.102 --> 14:23.932
We don't call them that, Chloe.

14:24.035 --> 14:25.312
Yeah, not good.

14:25.416 --> 14:28.246
It was one of Trip's friends
that he pays for.

14:28.350 --> 14:30.076
- Yeah.
- Oh, well--

14:30.179 --> 14:31.525
So then what would you call it?

14:31.629 --> 14:32.699
A prostitute?

14:32.802 --> 14:34.183
A ho? A tramp--
- No! No, no.

14:34.287 --> 14:35.840
No, Chloe.

14:35.944 --> 14:38.256
Scott, a little help.
- Of course. No.

14:38.360 --> 14:42.122
Chloe, those are not good words
to use for a woman, for anyone,

14:42.226 --> 14:45.988
whether or not she may
or may not have, you know, sex.

14:46.092 --> 14:48.335
No, you just still want
to be respectful,

14:48.439 --> 14:53.582
so you would use a term like,
um... lady of the night.

14:53.685 --> 14:55.411
Chloe, that's a good one.

14:55.515 --> 14:56.861
Like a vampire.

14:56.965 --> 14:58.414
Yeah, except she doesn't
suck blood.

14:58.518 --> 14:59.657
She's--

14:59.760 --> 15:02.280
Let's table this conversation
until after dinner.

15:02.384 --> 15:04.041
Good, good.
Yeah. It's--

15:04.144 --> 15:06.560
Or until you turn 18.
Whenever.

15:06.664 --> 15:08.079
But--

15:08.183 --> 15:09.839
Please be the pizza.

15:50.363 --> 15:51.571
Charlie?

16:00.442 --> 16:01.512
Okay.

16:07.863 --> 16:09.106
Charlie?

16:10.590 --> 16:12.937
What is it, boy?

16:13.041 --> 16:14.214
Hey, you're okay.

16:14.318 --> 16:16.837
Hey, what's--what's out there?

16:41.586 --> 16:42.656
What page you on?

16:42.760 --> 16:44.589
Hold your horses, mister.
I'm almost done.

16:45.728 --> 16:47.006
Okay, missus.

16:53.633 --> 16:54.461
Well...?

16:54.565 --> 16:55.807
I am going to need
a couple of days

16:55.911 --> 16:57.706
to really form an opinion.

16:59.018 --> 17:00.812
Are you serious?

17:00.916 --> 17:03.712
No. It's really good.

17:03.815 --> 17:05.334
- Really?
- Yeah, it's really good.

17:06.749 --> 17:07.578
Really?
- Mm-hm.

17:07.681 --> 17:09.580
Like, don't let this go
to your head,

17:09.683 --> 17:12.169
but it might actually
be a masterpiece.

17:12.272 --> 17:14.136
- Are you serious?
-  Mm-hm.

17:14.240 --> 17:19.866
What's your favorite part?

17:19.969 --> 17:21.971
I'll tell you tomorrow.

17:22.075 --> 17:25.872
Okay. It can--
it can wait till tomorrow.

17:25.975 --> 17:27.598
Okay.

17:29.048 --> 17:30.359
Guys, guys, guys!

17:30.463 --> 17:33.431
- Oh.
- There's something outside.

17:33.535 --> 17:34.639
Uh huh.

17:34.743 --> 17:36.607
<i>I--I just heard
an animal, and it's hurt,</i>

17:36.710 --> 17:39.920
<i>and we need to go right now</i>
and go and help.

17:40.024 --> 17:42.440
Oh, um...

17:42.544 --> 17:44.477
Uh...

17:44.580 --> 17:45.478
Well...

17:45.581 --> 17:46.479
Come on.

17:46.582 --> 17:50.276
Okay, okay. Let's...
let's check it out.

17:50.379 --> 17:52.519
Okay. Give me--give me--

17:52.623 --> 17:54.797
-  <i>No, right now.</i>
- No? Right now. Okay.

17:56.765 --> 17:57.662
Whoa.

17:57.766 --> 17:58.801
Whoo.

17:58.905 --> 18:00.493
Let's see.

18:00.596 --> 18:03.806
Whoo-hoo. Wow.

18:05.118 --> 18:07.016
Oh, it was a--it was a tree.

18:07.120 --> 18:08.294
It's just a tree.

18:08.397 --> 18:11.262
No. There was a dog.

18:11.366 --> 18:13.057
Make sure it's okay.

18:13.161 --> 18:14.886
Honey, I think it
was just a tree.

18:18.131 --> 18:19.546
Oh, hold on.
Hold on.

18:39.911 --> 18:41.327
Shoo.

18:43.915 --> 18:47.298
Hey, shoo. Shoo!

19:07.146 --> 19:08.147
What was it?

19:08.250 --> 19:10.252
Just a sketchy little coyote.
No big deal.

19:10.356 --> 19:11.495
Now let's all go back
to our own beds.

19:11.598 --> 19:12.772
Charlie and his little one,

19:12.875 --> 19:14.912
we can recreate exactly
where we were before.

19:20.987 --> 19:22.575
Oh shit.

19:24.439 --> 19:26.648
Oh! Oh, my God.

19:27.890 --> 19:31.998
Oh no. Oh.

19:32.101 --> 19:35.450
Oh, fuck. Oh, fuck. Oh, fuck.

19:35.553 --> 19:37.486
Oh, no, no, no,
no, no, no, no.

19:37.590 --> 19:39.212
Oh no, no.

19:39.316 --> 19:42.250
Oh, Jesus, fuck.

19:42.353 --> 19:44.390
Fucking shit.

19:44.493 --> 19:46.806
Ahh. It's not that bad.

19:46.909 --> 19:48.808
Oh, God.

19:51.466 --> 19:53.951
It's not great.
It's not great.

19:55.124 --> 19:57.092
We wanted a new one.

20:00.716 --> 20:02.649
Oh, shit.

20:02.753 --> 20:04.444
Oh, my God.

20:04.548 --> 20:05.721
It's gonna be okay, honey.

20:05.825 --> 20:07.620
It's okay.
It's okay.

20:09.725 --> 20:11.762
Oh. Oh.

20:15.041 --> 20:17.768
Jesus.

20:22.117 --> 20:23.843
I should have trimmed the tree.

20:27.018 --> 20:29.089
<i>While the rest
of LA felt the storm,</i>

20:29.193 --> 20:31.333
<i>the hills bore the brunt
of its fury,</i>

20:31.437 --> 20:32.783
<i>suffering the worst
of the damage,</i>

20:32.886 --> 20:36.683
<i>with downed trees
and widespread power outages.</i>

20:40.756 --> 20:42.724
What an idiot.

20:42.827 --> 20:43.794
God.

20:48.419 --> 20:50.249
Oh, yeah, that's just great.

20:52.630 --> 20:54.494
Oh, God.

21:03.158 --> 21:04.332
Lucy.

21:07.611 --> 21:12.616
Oh.
Oh, it's so gross.

21:12.719 --> 21:14.342
Make sure you get it all.

21:14.445 --> 21:15.515
Do you want to do it?

21:15.619 --> 21:19.001
Ew. As if, Dad.
As if.

21:19.105 --> 21:21.452
It's congealed, and it's like,
ground into the concrete.

21:21.556 --> 21:22.798
I'm gonna throw up.

21:27.355 --> 21:28.666
Hey.

21:28.770 --> 21:29.943
You can just leave the food
at the door.

21:30.047 --> 21:32.118
You don't have to make
a big thing of it.

21:32.221 --> 21:33.913
Uh, what food?

21:35.880 --> 21:37.123
I ordered Thai food.

21:37.226 --> 21:38.918
I--I don't--
I'm the neighbor.

21:39.021 --> 21:40.644
Like, yeah.

21:40.747 --> 21:43.232
Trip! Door!

21:43.336 --> 21:45.027
Wait, how do you guys
have power?

21:45.131 --> 21:47.098
Generator. Trip says he's
gonna go off the grid soon.

21:47.202 --> 21:48.307
Screw the man.

21:48.410 --> 21:50.067
Oh. It's Liv.

21:50.170 --> 21:51.586
Hey.
- Hey, Trip.

21:51.689 --> 21:53.519
I thought you were my--
I thought you were--

21:53.622 --> 21:54.727
you were somebody else.

21:54.830 --> 21:56.280
How you doing?
- Good. How are you?

21:56.384 --> 21:57.385
-  Good.
- You look good.

21:57.488 --> 21:59.248
I'm okay, yeah.

21:59.352 --> 22:01.527
How's Stu?
- Scott.

22:01.630 --> 22:03.460
- Scott, sorry.
- Yeah. He's good.

22:03.563 --> 22:05.116
He's pulling it together.
Doing well.

22:05.220 --> 22:06.255
Hey, listen.
If you're...

22:06.359 --> 22:07.395
if you're looking
for some water,

22:07.498 --> 22:08.672
we can't help you.

22:08.775 --> 22:10.052
I mean, we barely have enough.

22:10.156 --> 22:11.053
No.

22:12.538 --> 22:15.437
No. Trip, do you have a cat?

22:15.541 --> 22:19.303
Lucy. Is she okay?

22:19.407 --> 22:22.341
Um, well, we found this
in our driveway.

22:22.444 --> 22:23.376
-  <i>That's her collar.</i>
-  So, yeah.

22:23.480 --> 22:25.447
Just gonna give that to you.
- Ew.

22:25.551 --> 22:27.173
<i>You found this
in your driveway?</i>

22:27.276 --> 22:28.381
Did you leave
the door open again?

22:28.485 --> 22:29.486
Okay, I'm gonna go.

22:29.589 --> 22:31.591
Did you leave the door open?
Okay.

22:31.695 --> 22:33.317
I told you to watch the door.
- Bye.

22:33.421 --> 22:35.802
- ...Thai food. I'm hungry.
- Lucy!

22:35.906 --> 22:37.356
Here, kitty kitty,
kitty kitty.

22:37.459 --> 22:39.081
<i>Thankfully,
no fires broke out last night,</i>

22:39.185 --> 22:42.361
<i>but road closures have swamped
emergency services regardless.</i>

22:42.464 --> 22:44.673
<i>Expect delays
for the next 24 hours.</i>

22:44.777 --> 22:46.434
<i>Stay safe out there, LA.</i>

22:49.402 --> 22:51.370
Maybe--maybe turn a bit

22:51.473 --> 22:52.716
to the left, Scott.
- What's that?

22:52.819 --> 22:55.132
Maybe try and move
at a different angle...

22:56.996 --> 22:58.963
To the right? This way?
Straight down?

22:59.067 --> 23:00.379
Yeah.

23:00.482 --> 23:01.863
You sure that's on
the right setting?

23:01.966 --> 23:03.727
There's only one setting,
I think.

23:03.830 --> 23:04.935
It's just forward and reverse.

23:05.038 --> 23:05.936
Really?

23:06.039 --> 23:07.213
I've been doing this
for like 20 minutes,

23:07.316 --> 23:09.111
and it looks like an animal
just kind of clawed at it.

23:09.215 --> 23:11.355
Wow. Hey.

23:11.459 --> 23:13.461
- Pretty cool, huh?
- Yeah.

23:13.564 --> 23:15.670
I wanted to bring the chainsaw,

23:15.773 --> 23:17.913
but, of course,
Sheila said, “No.”

23:18.017 --> 23:19.743
Well, that's probably
for the best.

23:19.846 --> 23:21.538
Oh, but good news.
Tony said we got really lucky

23:21.641 --> 23:23.125
that the tree didn't damage
the gas main.

23:23.229 --> 23:24.299
Could have been a lot worse.

23:24.403 --> 23:26.715
Trust me, you don't want
a gas leak.

23:26.819 --> 23:29.925
One small spark and boom.

23:30.029 --> 23:32.065
Bye, bye, Dream House.

23:32.169 --> 23:34.033
Huh. Well, that's great.

23:34.136 --> 23:35.310
That's a silver lining.

23:35.414 --> 23:36.656
That's right.
Oh shit.

23:36.760 --> 23:37.623
<i>Whether it's a seal</i>

23:37.726 --> 23:39.279
<i>straying too far
from the shore--</i>

23:39.383 --> 23:41.558
I'm seriously concerned
your dad's gonna lop off an arm.

23:41.661 --> 23:42.593
<i>...scattering in confusion.</i>

23:42.697 --> 23:44.664
He's built stuff before.

23:44.768 --> 23:46.321
Things that are pre-assembled.

23:46.425 --> 23:47.943
<i>Much like their
terrestrial counterparts,</i>

23:48.047 --> 23:49.980
<i>sharks are opportunists.</i>

23:50.083 --> 23:51.775
<i>They don't waste energy.</i>

23:51.878 --> 23:53.432
Did you know most shark attacks

23:53.535 --> 23:55.606
are because they mistake us
for seals?

23:55.710 --> 23:57.297
Did you know most seal
attacks happen

23:57.401 --> 23:58.575
because they mistake us
for kelp?

24:00.197 --> 24:01.543
Mom, that wasn't funny.

24:02.544 --> 24:03.821
Put a bit of elbow grease
into it.

24:03.925 --> 24:06.065
Maybe the battery
could be a bit lower too.

24:06.168 --> 24:07.825
It could--it could be.

24:09.448 --> 24:11.070
You sure that's
on the top setting?

24:11.173 --> 24:12.796
Can I just have your phone?

24:12.899 --> 24:17.939
Oh. Oh, sorry, I only have 30%.

24:18.042 --> 24:19.078
So?

24:19.181 --> 24:21.874
So no.

24:21.977 --> 24:22.978
God.

24:26.879 --> 24:28.018
I can't believe she's gone.

24:29.122 --> 24:30.158
How do you know?

24:30.261 --> 24:32.298
You only looked for her
for like five minutes.

24:32.401 --> 24:34.093
You're right.
I'm a fucking idiot.

24:34.196 --> 24:35.232
God damn it.

24:35.335 --> 24:37.441
She's probably out there,
she's scared to death.

24:37.545 --> 24:39.650
She's probably pissed at me.
- Yeah.

24:40.789 --> 24:41.997
I'm gonna go find her.

24:42.101 --> 24:43.412
Oh yeah, great idea.

24:43.516 --> 24:46.001
But maybe leave the gun.

24:47.416 --> 24:49.453
You're right.

24:49.557 --> 24:51.248
Uh-oh.

24:51.351 --> 24:54.734
Oh. What the hell, Trip?

24:54.838 --> 24:56.840
I think the generator went out.

24:57.910 --> 24:59.705
- How am I gonna charge my phone?
- I don't know.

24:59.808 --> 25:01.016
Have you thought
about unplugging it?

25:01.120 --> 25:02.984
Might be good
for your mental health.

25:03.087 --> 25:04.744
Jesus Christ.

25:04.848 --> 25:06.056
Lucy!

25:09.197 --> 25:10.336
You're a great host, Trip.

25:10.439 --> 25:11.993
Thanks!

25:15.893 --> 25:16.653
What?

25:18.344 --> 25:19.207
Oh, shite.

25:19.310 --> 25:20.484
What?

25:20.588 --> 25:22.244
Missed a few texts from Sheila.

25:22.348 --> 25:23.556
Uh-oh.

25:23.660 --> 25:25.454
Looks like she needs
my expertise on the grill.

25:25.558 --> 25:26.973
Yeah, I get it.

25:27.077 --> 25:29.044
When Liv summons me,
I don't waste any time either.

25:30.736 --> 25:32.427
-“Summons me”?
- Well.

25:32.531 --> 25:34.256
Nobody summons me, mate.

25:34.360 --> 25:36.155
I'm my own man.

25:36.258 --> 25:37.294
Remember that.

25:37.397 --> 25:38.709
Yeah, no, I didn't.

25:38.813 --> 25:40.400
Okay, yeah, my bad.

25:41.470 --> 25:42.920
Fuck. I gotta go.

25:43.024 --> 25:47.166
Tell Sheila Liv and I say hi...
or don't.

25:47.269 --> 25:48.339
She's the worst.

26:10.707 --> 26:12.156
Hey, babe.

26:12.260 --> 26:13.606
-  <i>Where are you, Tony?
-</i> Yeah.

26:13.710 --> 26:15.125
Yeah, just leavin' now.
Just leavin' now.

26:15.228 --> 26:16.540
<i>Yeah?
Are you coming home?</i>

26:16.644 --> 26:17.748
<i>Told you
I got carried away.</i>

26:17.852 --> 26:19.474
You know what Scott's like.

26:19.578 --> 26:20.958
Man can't take a piss
on his own.

26:21.062 --> 26:22.442
<i>all this shit.</i>

26:22.546 --> 26:24.997
I'll be home soon.
Okay? Yeah.

26:25.100 --> 26:26.412
-  <i>Screw you.</i>
- I love you.

26:26.515 --> 26:27.620
<i>Dickhead.</i>

26:28.552 --> 26:30.140
For fuck's sake.

26:36.249 --> 26:37.078
What do you want?

26:37.181 --> 26:38.182
Shoo!

26:39.943 --> 26:42.531
Go on. Get the fuck out of here.

26:42.635 --> 26:43.740
What are you looking at?

26:45.051 --> 26:46.052
<i>What?</i>

26:53.646 --> 26:55.165
What the hell's wrong with them?

27:06.555 --> 27:08.834
<i>Oh. Oh, it's the kid.</i>

27:08.937 --> 27:12.147
Hey. Um, do you hear that sound?

27:13.528 --> 27:15.288
Help!

27:17.739 --> 27:21.156
Sounds like somebody's singing
or... dying.

27:21.260 --> 27:24.090
Stay back.
Get back.

27:24.194 --> 27:26.127
No!

27:26.886 --> 27:28.508
Does Stu sing?

27:28.612 --> 27:29.682
Wait a minute.

27:32.892 --> 27:34.514
No, it's gone now.

27:34.618 --> 27:36.655
Huh. Anyway.

27:36.758 --> 27:38.346
'Sup...

27:38.449 --> 27:41.211
Um, are you okay?

27:41.314 --> 27:43.731
Yeah, I'm okay.
Why? Don't I look okay?

27:43.834 --> 27:47.493
No. You look like
you have the flu.

27:47.596 --> 27:49.564
No, it's just these allergies.

27:49.668 --> 27:52.153
It's... y'know.

27:54.258 --> 27:56.122
Can I help you?

27:56.226 --> 27:58.469
Is your mommy
or your daddy home?

28:00.368 --> 28:01.472
Mom!

28:01.576 --> 28:03.405
That weirdo from next door
is here.

28:05.753 --> 28:06.754
Look, I'm standing right here.

28:06.857 --> 28:08.169
I can hear that.

28:11.862 --> 28:15.383
You think Lucy was in the tree
when it fell?

28:15.486 --> 28:17.074
Yeah.

28:17.178 --> 28:19.870
But you haven't seen
any sign of her?

28:19.974 --> 28:21.251
Well, just the collar.

28:23.322 --> 28:26.497
So the collar could have
slipped off, right?

28:26.601 --> 28:28.223
There's a possibility.

28:28.327 --> 28:31.779
So stop flirting with me,
Liv, and help me find her.

28:31.882 --> 28:34.229
Here, kitty,
kitty, kitty, kitty.

28:34.333 --> 28:36.576
- Lucy!
- Here, Lucy.

28:36.680 --> 28:37.612
- Come on.
- Here, sweet princess.

28:37.716 --> 28:39.579
Here, girl. Here, girl.

28:39.683 --> 28:40.649
Here, sweet kitty.

28:40.753 --> 28:41.789
Lucy. Good girl, kitty.

28:41.892 --> 28:43.031
Mom, what are you doing?

28:43.135 --> 28:44.688
We're helping Trip
find his cat.

28:44.792 --> 28:46.345
- But it's dead.
- Definitely missing.

28:46.448 --> 28:47.449
Uh-huh. Lucy.

28:47.553 --> 28:49.728
Come on. Good girl.
- Oh, I think I see her.

28:52.903 --> 28:54.629
Oh, honey...

28:54.733 --> 28:58.806
Lucy... Lucy girl...

29:00.877 --> 29:03.776
No. No, no, no.

29:03.880 --> 29:06.572
Oh, God. No.

29:06.675 --> 29:09.471
What am I gonna do now?

29:11.611 --> 29:12.923
No pictures!

29:16.685 --> 29:19.758
<i>Tony, I'm getting hungry.</i>

29:23.071 --> 29:24.210
Tony.

29:25.315 --> 29:29.181
You're a sad sack of shit.

29:44.472 --> 29:48.096
<i>Hey, sorry, folks.
Tony is otherwise engaged.</i>

29:48.200 --> 29:51.824
If you ended up too drunk
to find your way home

29:51.928 --> 29:54.171
and I have to come looking
for you again,

29:54.275 --> 29:56.415
I'm going to lose it on you,
Tony.

29:56.518 --> 29:59.867
It's going to be the last straw,
and I mean it!

30:01.351 --> 30:02.421
Dipshit.

30:12.914 --> 30:15.089
Hey, I forgot about these.

30:15.192 --> 30:17.056
Oh, good.
See if they still work.

30:17.160 --> 30:19.507
Hi, Sheila.
How're you doin'?

30:19.610 --> 30:20.508
Testing.

30:20.611 --> 30:22.303
- Oh, really?
-  <i>Have you seen him?</i>

30:22.406 --> 30:24.615
- Yeah, he left a while ago.
-  <i>Testing, testing.</i>

30:24.719 --> 30:25.720
- Uh huh.
-  <i>Let me know.</i>

30:25.824 --> 30:26.825
- Of course.
-  <i>Thank you.</i>

30:26.928 --> 30:28.136
- All right. Take care, honey.
-  <i>Bye.</i>

30:28.240 --> 30:29.275
<i>Finally talked
to the power company.</i>

30:29.379 --> 30:30.656
They said they're working on it,
whatever that means.

30:30.759 --> 30:31.864
But the whole city's a mess.

30:31.968 --> 30:34.315
Power lines are down.
It's--it's Armageddon.

30:34.418 --> 30:35.764
What's--what's wrong?

30:35.868 --> 30:37.111
Uh, I just got off the phone
with Sheila,

30:37.214 --> 30:38.733
and she said Tony
isn't home yet,

30:38.837 --> 30:40.735
so she's really worried.

30:40.839 --> 30:41.805
<i>That's weird.
Maybe...</i>

30:41.909 --> 30:43.151
<i>maybe he followed the rainbow</i>

30:43.255 --> 30:44.394
<i>to a pot of gold.</i>
- What is this?

30:44.497 --> 30:46.120
-  <i>Maybe he did.
-</i> Maybe he, just like,

30:46.223 --> 30:47.915
stopped at a pub for a pint.

30:48.018 --> 30:49.364
- Maybe.
- To make a point.

30:52.436 --> 30:53.541
Whoa.

30:53.644 --> 30:55.232
-  Jesus.
-  Huh.

30:55.336 --> 30:57.683
That's wild.
-  Wow.

30:57.786 --> 30:58.718
Do you hear that?

30:58.822 --> 30:59.927
<i>There's a lot of them.</i>

31:00.030 --> 31:01.273
Charlie, easy.

31:01.376 --> 31:04.103
They're just--they're just
talking to each other.

31:04.207 --> 31:07.348
Having a little
coyote convention.

31:09.108 --> 31:10.351
Darn.

31:37.654 --> 31:39.414
Enough with the games.

31:49.977 --> 31:51.012
Oh, my God.

31:51.116 --> 31:53.912
You guys, look.

31:54.015 --> 31:59.020
Oh, he looks lost.
He looks--looks scared, huh?

31:59.124 --> 32:01.195
It's sad when they lose
their pack.

32:01.298 --> 32:03.611
Have you lost your way home?

32:03.714 --> 32:05.682
- Oh, God.
-  Jesus.

32:05.785 --> 32:08.167
Uh, Chloe. Why don't you
take Charlie inside, honey?

32:08.271 --> 32:11.653
<i>Uh... yeah</i>.

32:11.757 --> 32:12.758
Take Charlie.

32:14.070 --> 32:15.381
Whoa, easy.

32:15.485 --> 32:17.176
-  What about you guys?
- We're right behind you.

32:17.280 --> 32:18.212
- Yeah, yeah.
- Go ahead, honey.

32:18.315 --> 32:19.489
Get him out of here.
- Right behind you.

32:19.592 --> 32:22.492
Easy. Nice and easy.

32:22.595 --> 32:25.874
Just closing the garage.
-  <i>Scott?</i>

32:25.978 --> 32:26.910
- Yeah?
- Hey, Scott.

32:27.014 --> 32:28.532
- I'm working on it.
- Oh, come on.

32:28.636 --> 32:30.569
- I'm working on it.
- Come on. Gotta go.

32:32.122 --> 32:33.917
<i>Oh! Oh, shit.</i>

32:35.712 --> 32:37.679
-  <i>Oh.</i>
- Oh, my god.

32:37.783 --> 32:38.646
Hah.

32:40.027 --> 32:42.615
I think it wanted to eat you.

32:42.719 --> 32:44.859
No...

32:44.963 --> 32:46.895
Maybe just a nibble.

32:46.999 --> 32:48.587
Yeah.

32:51.452 --> 32:52.591
Tony!

32:54.696 --> 32:55.732
Baby!

33:48.647 --> 33:49.786
Motherfuckers!

33:54.066 --> 33:57.690
Get the hell out of my house!

33:57.794 --> 33:59.106
Get away!

34:01.384 --> 34:06.768
Get away.
Get away! Get away!

34:06.872 --> 34:07.976
Get out.

34:14.983 --> 34:16.399
Fuck.

34:23.785 --> 34:25.132
This is fun.

34:25.235 --> 34:27.858
It's like we're having a campout
inside, in our house.

34:27.962 --> 34:29.550
Chloe gets a nice slice.

34:29.653 --> 34:30.999
Here you go.

34:31.103 --> 34:33.830
And bon appetit.
Mm-mm.

34:33.933 --> 34:35.590
What is that?

34:35.694 --> 34:38.352
It's like, um...
it's sort of a meat.

34:38.455 --> 34:39.939
Yeah. It's good.
You'll love it.

34:40.043 --> 34:42.735
Honey.
No one wants your fake meats.

34:42.839 --> 34:44.220
I'll just have bread and water.

34:44.323 --> 34:45.324
Thanks.

34:45.428 --> 34:47.015
You're not a prisoner, Chloe.

34:47.119 --> 34:48.086
Are you sure?

34:48.189 --> 34:50.778
Because this feels like torture.

34:50.881 --> 34:52.918
I don't know why
you won't just let me heat up

34:53.021 --> 34:54.920
the frozen dinners.
- Oh yeah, please.

34:55.023 --> 34:57.612
Heat up the frozen meals
with no power.

34:57.716 --> 34:59.166
I'd love to see this.

34:59.269 --> 35:01.168
You gonna make a little fire
in the kitchen?

35:04.999 --> 35:08.140
Gas is different than electric.

35:08.244 --> 35:09.107
-  <i>Different bills.</i>
-  <i>Different bills.</i>

35:09.210 --> 35:10.211
-  <i>Yeah.</i>
-  <i>That's right.</i>

35:10.315 --> 35:12.075
-  <i>Mm-hm.</i>
- You got a smart mom.

35:15.147 --> 35:16.631
Whoa.

35:16.735 --> 35:19.496
<i>They are wild.</i>

35:19.600 --> 35:21.567
They don't want
free thinkers.

35:21.671 --> 35:22.499
No, no, no.

35:22.603 --> 35:24.639
They want little robots
marching in line

35:24.743 --> 35:27.090
to the sound of whatever story
they want you to believe.

35:27.194 --> 35:29.403
Goddamn, they said
that runs this country.

35:30.783 --> 35:32.060
No, I'm not gonna take off
my shirt.

35:32.164 --> 35:35.719
Fuck you. Pervert.

35:37.445 --> 35:39.620
What was I saying?

35:39.723 --> 35:40.931
Okay. Yeah, the lizards.

35:41.035 --> 35:42.001
Um...

35:46.730 --> 35:49.250
um... what...

35:50.734 --> 35:51.770
was that?

36:09.443 --> 36:12.066
What's gotten into them?

36:12.170 --> 36:15.207
Maybe they are hungry.

36:15.311 --> 36:16.864
Yeah.

36:16.967 --> 36:19.004
They wouldn't turn down food.

36:19.107 --> 36:20.626
I'm gonna try it.

36:20.730 --> 36:21.696
Why not.

36:23.767 --> 36:25.321
Mmmm.

36:32.051 --> 36:33.743
<i>No, no. God.</i>

36:35.917 --> 36:36.849
It's good.

36:39.093 --> 36:42.821
Um... hello?

36:47.515 --> 36:48.792
What the fuck was that?

36:48.896 --> 36:50.587
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.

36:50.691 --> 36:51.450
What?

36:56.317 --> 36:57.905
Okay, screw this.
I'm getting out of here.

37:08.847 --> 37:11.953
Um... hi.

37:15.785 --> 37:17.994
Bye-bye.

37:18.097 --> 37:19.409
Go.

37:30.006 --> 37:31.559
What the fuck.

37:36.392 --> 37:40.465
Fuck!

37:45.297 --> 37:48.438
See you next time around, baby.

37:59.967 --> 38:00.899
Hey.

38:01.002 --> 38:03.971
Fuck. Fuck!

38:04.074 --> 38:05.800
You scared the shit out of me.

38:05.904 --> 38:07.215
Uh...

38:07.319 --> 38:09.079
Where the fuck have you been?

38:09.183 --> 38:10.357
Charging my phone in your car.

38:10.460 --> 38:11.530
I got stuck in a scroll.

38:11.634 --> 38:13.014
I'm not fucking paying you
for that.

38:21.368 --> 38:23.991
Actually, I'm glad you're back.

38:24.094 --> 38:27.063
Listen, I need a favor.

38:27.166 --> 38:28.375
I need you to help me.

38:31.619 --> 38:35.140
I need you to--I need you
to help me grieve.

38:35.243 --> 38:36.279
Um...

38:36.383 --> 38:37.970
God, do you hear that?

38:38.074 --> 38:39.834
I need you to help me hurt.

38:41.629 --> 38:43.631
Can you help me hurt?

38:48.912 --> 38:52.606
Yeah. I can do that.

38:52.709 --> 38:54.435
Yeah.

38:54.539 --> 38:55.781
You've been a bad boy.

38:55.885 --> 38:58.439
Oh, God!

38:58.543 --> 39:00.407
You're such a sad,
pathetic loser.

39:00.510 --> 39:02.719
Oh, yeah. Yeah.

39:04.031 --> 39:06.792
Poor little boy.
Daddy doesn't love you.

39:06.896 --> 39:08.415
Yeah. Ah!

39:08.518 --> 39:09.485
Feel that pain.

39:09.588 --> 39:11.279
- It hurts so bad.
-  Bitch!

39:11.383 --> 39:12.453
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

39:12.557 --> 39:14.006
Punish me.
Punish me.

39:14.110 --> 39:15.076
I want you to punish me.

39:15.180 --> 39:16.250
Yeah.

39:17.907 --> 39:19.598
Yeah, more. More.
-  There you go.

39:19.702 --> 39:21.289
There you go.

39:21.393 --> 39:23.119
You're a little snowflake bitch.

39:23.222 --> 39:25.155
- Yeah, yeah, yeah. Tell me--
-  There you go.

39:25.259 --> 39:26.985
Tell me I'll never have
another pet.

39:27.088 --> 39:29.815
I'll never have another pet.

39:32.093 --> 39:33.750
Yeah.

39:33.854 --> 39:36.304
<i>Oh, don't stop. Oh.</i>

39:36.408 --> 39:37.754
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God, Trip.

39:37.858 --> 39:39.411
They got inside.

39:39.515 --> 39:40.792
Who got inside?

39:42.310 --> 39:45.106
What's wrong? Chill.
- They got inside.

39:45.210 --> 39:47.315
- I'm not inside.
- Sorry.

39:51.941 --> 39:52.700
Fuck off!

39:52.804 --> 39:54.253
Get back here, you bitch!

39:54.357 --> 39:55.807
Yo! Oh fuck!

39:57.429 --> 39:59.051
<i>Bitch!</i>

39:59.155 --> 40:00.881
Where the fuck are you?!

40:02.227 --> 40:03.193
My God!

40:03.297 --> 40:04.678
Ah fuck!

40:09.476 --> 40:11.201
Ah!

40:15.205 --> 40:16.690
Ah, Trip!

40:16.793 --> 40:18.830
I'm so happy that you made it.

40:18.933 --> 40:21.004
I'm so sorry that I left.

40:21.108 --> 40:22.730
I promise I will never
do that again.

40:22.834 --> 40:24.456
I promise I will never,
ever do that again.

40:24.560 --> 40:25.871
Fucking promise.

40:27.459 --> 40:28.529
What the fuck am I supposed
to do with it?

40:28.633 --> 40:29.979
One of those fuckers comes in,

40:30.082 --> 40:32.499
you smack the living shit
out of it.

40:35.881 --> 40:37.020
With this?

40:39.747 --> 40:41.818
Give me one of those.
- What? Are you fucking nuts?

40:41.922 --> 40:42.957
You'd shoot me.

40:47.755 --> 40:49.964
Come on, motherfucker.

41:01.804 --> 41:03.219
<i>Come on, bitch.</i>

41:03.322 --> 41:05.946
They can open doors?

41:15.127 --> 41:16.991
Sorry.

41:17.095 --> 41:18.199
You bitch!

41:19.373 --> 41:20.823
Ah!

41:21.962 --> 41:24.343
<i>Zombie. Someone's asleep.</i>

41:24.447 --> 41:25.552
<i>No. The neck.</i>

41:25.655 --> 41:26.967
<i>Adjusting the neck.
Walking.</i>

41:27.070 --> 41:29.176
Walking out.

41:29.279 --> 41:31.385
The spine?

41:31.489 --> 41:32.835
Chiropractor.
-  <i>So stupid.</i>

41:32.938 --> 41:34.008
-  <i>Lunatic.</i>
- Can't give up.

41:34.112 --> 41:36.010
Neck. Wait, sshhh...

41:39.255 --> 41:40.463
What was that?

41:40.567 --> 41:42.154
Is Trip lighting up fireworks?

41:42.258 --> 41:43.535
That checks.

41:43.639 --> 41:45.710
So, Chloe. Chloe.

41:45.813 --> 41:47.574
Chloe, Chloe, come on.

41:47.677 --> 41:48.989
Chloe, Chloe.

41:52.820 --> 41:54.615
<i>Why is he setting them
off inside?</i>

41:54.719 --> 41:55.754
I don't know.
He's an idiot.

41:55.858 --> 41:57.031
I mean--
-  <i>Sshh.</i>

41:59.724 --> 42:03.003
Yeah, what is that?

42:03.106 --> 42:05.039
You don't think he shot
that poor girl, do you?

42:10.907 --> 42:12.806
I don't think those
are fireworks.

42:12.909 --> 42:13.703
He's probably--

42:15.187 --> 42:16.085
Charlie!

42:17.983 --> 42:19.088
Go grab him.

42:19.191 --> 42:20.468
-  <i>Scott, come on.</i>
- Okay. I'll go get him.

42:20.572 --> 42:21.711
You guys stay here.

42:22.712 --> 42:24.611
Ah, it's my turn
when I come back.

42:24.714 --> 42:25.922
You know, I'm gonna call 911.

42:26.026 --> 42:27.614
I don't--
something feels weird.

42:29.547 --> 42:30.927
<i>Please hold.</i>

42:31.031 --> 42:33.102
<i>All operators are currently
assisting other callers.</i>

42:33.205 --> 42:34.103
Shit.

42:35.311 --> 42:37.002
Charlie. Hey.

42:38.694 --> 42:40.281
Come on, buddy.

42:41.593 --> 42:43.043
Ah, there you are.

42:43.146 --> 42:44.769
Thanks for interrupting
the game, Charlie.

42:44.872 --> 42:46.529
Turd.

42:46.633 --> 42:47.772
Come on, buddy.

42:47.875 --> 42:48.876
Come on, good boy.

42:48.980 --> 42:50.257
Come on. Easy.

42:50.360 --> 42:53.398
Hey, hey. Take it easy.

42:53.501 --> 42:54.502
Is it really that...

42:54.606 --> 42:55.814
bad in there?

43:05.375 --> 43:06.618
Whoa.

43:08.482 --> 43:10.139
What is going on tonight?

43:14.350 --> 43:15.593
What the hell?

43:22.600 --> 43:23.946
Yeah, Charlie.

43:24.049 --> 43:26.086
Tough guy. You wouldn't last
two minutes out there.

43:27.881 --> 43:29.054
<i>You okay?</i>

43:30.193 --> 43:34.508
Yeah. I'm good.

43:34.612 --> 43:36.165
It's wild out there.

43:39.237 --> 43:40.341
Ow!

43:40.445 --> 43:41.584
- Oh, God.
- God damn it.

43:41.688 --> 43:42.999
- Get him, Scott.
- Yes, I know.

43:43.103 --> 43:44.104
I'll get him.

43:47.970 --> 43:49.316
Liv, get back inside.

43:54.183 --> 43:55.218
Oh, my God.

43:57.531 --> 43:58.981
<i>Mom.</i>

43:59.084 --> 44:00.638
Chloe, go!

44:00.741 --> 44:02.294
- Run!
-  <i>Get back inside.</i>

44:04.745 --> 44:05.712
Oh, my God.

44:07.368 --> 44:08.473
What about Dad?

44:08.576 --> 44:09.750
He's a fast runner.

44:09.854 --> 44:12.270
I've never seen him
run in my life.

44:12.373 --> 44:15.169
Charlie. Charlie.

44:15.273 --> 44:17.102
Ah, shit!

44:24.282 --> 44:25.939
Fucking Charlie.

44:26.525 --> 44:28.873
Mom? Mom?

44:28.976 --> 44:30.391
Yeah.

44:30.495 --> 44:32.670
Mom, this is all my fault.

44:32.773 --> 44:34.706
What do you mean?

44:34.810 --> 44:37.571
I saw a coyote and I--
and it looked hungry,

44:37.675 --> 44:40.125
so I fed it.

44:40.229 --> 44:44.578
And then the next day,
there were two of them,

44:44.682 --> 44:46.614
so I fed them both.

44:46.718 --> 44:47.892
I thought if stopped
feeding them,

44:47.995 --> 44:51.896
they would stop coming
but they didn't stop.

44:51.999 --> 44:53.345
Mom, they didn't stop.

44:53.449 --> 44:58.316
Honey.
Oh, Chloe. Honey.

44:58.419 --> 45:00.283
It's all my fault.

45:00.387 --> 45:04.529
No, Chloe.
Look at me.

45:04.632 --> 45:06.496
This is not normal behavior.

45:09.672 --> 45:10.708
Okay.

45:10.811 --> 45:12.123
Okay.

45:13.124 --> 45:14.263
Charlie.

45:16.437 --> 45:17.749
Charlie.

45:19.268 --> 45:20.441
Charlie.

45:21.753 --> 45:23.755
Hey, Trip.
It's Scott.

45:23.859 --> 45:26.206
Just looking for my dog.

45:26.309 --> 45:28.346
Don't shoot me.

45:31.176 --> 45:32.246
Oh, my God.

45:32.350 --> 45:36.492
He's got a jungle
in his living room.

45:36.595 --> 45:37.942
It's wild.

45:38.045 --> 45:39.322
Of course he does.

45:39.426 --> 45:41.946
Charlie. Hey.

45:42.878 --> 45:44.534
Here, here, Charlie.

45:44.638 --> 45:46.260
Come on, Charlie.

45:46.364 --> 45:48.504
Charlie, fuck.

45:48.607 --> 45:51.162
Uh...

45:51.265 --> 45:55.476
Trip, did I hear gunshots
in here?

45:55.580 --> 45:57.030
What the fuck.

46:00.447 --> 46:02.552
Charlie.

46:17.360 --> 46:18.914
Charlie.

46:33.342 --> 46:35.793
Charlie.

46:43.145 --> 46:47.321
Help me... Stu.

47:04.994 --> 47:08.860
Oh! Whoa!
Hey! Don't shoot!

47:08.964 --> 47:11.138
Stay the fuck away.

47:11.242 --> 47:13.278
<i>It's okay. It's okay.
It's me.</i>

47:13.382 --> 47:16.592
I don't even know
who the fuck you are.

47:16.695 --> 47:18.456
Scott. We met.

47:18.559 --> 47:19.698
I'm the neighbor.

47:19.802 --> 47:21.459
You don't want
to shoot the neighbor.

47:23.012 --> 47:26.222
I'm so sorry.
I...

47:26.326 --> 47:29.708
<i>It's okay. It's okay.</i>

47:29.812 --> 47:31.607
I'm just gonna
open the door, okay?

47:38.027 --> 47:39.580
Can you put the gun down, please?

47:42.618 --> 47:47.347
Yeah. I'm so--I'm so sorry.

47:47.450 --> 47:48.417
<i>It's okay.</i>

47:51.730 --> 47:54.078
They got in.

47:54.181 --> 47:56.287
They were everywhere.

47:56.390 --> 47:59.221
There were so many of them.
- Okay.

47:59.324 --> 48:01.809
I tried to stay
and fight with him,

48:01.913 --> 48:05.779
I did, but he insisted.

48:05.883 --> 48:07.781
He was so brave.

48:07.885 --> 48:12.959
He said, “Julie, go, go.
Get out of here.”

48:13.062 --> 48:15.064
So I did. I...

48:15.168 --> 48:19.379
I ran in here and then I--

48:19.482 --> 48:21.415
oh, God, I could hear him
screaming out there.

48:23.486 --> 48:27.870
Suddenly he stopped.

48:27.974 --> 48:30.459
It sounded like they
were eating him.

48:35.153 --> 48:38.985
I'm so sorry.
I'm so sorry.

48:39.088 --> 48:41.090
That's awful.

48:41.194 --> 48:43.058
It's not your fault.

48:43.161 --> 48:45.163
You--you...
you did what you could do.

48:45.267 --> 48:49.064
Yeah. I did everything I could.

48:49.167 --> 48:51.549
Listen. I gotta get back
to my family.

48:51.652 --> 48:53.585
You should come with me.

48:53.689 --> 48:56.830
I think if we go through
the backyards, really, really--

48:56.934 --> 48:59.591
No. There's no way
I'm walking out there.

48:59.695 --> 49:04.596
I can't stay here.
I have to go to my--

49:04.700 --> 49:05.666
We can drive.

49:07.599 --> 49:10.188
Okay, great. Okay, um...

49:12.466 --> 49:14.606
would you do me a favor
and go first,

49:14.710 --> 49:15.642
so you block my view,

49:15.745 --> 49:19.991
because the sight of blood
makes me really woozy.

49:20.095 --> 49:22.200
Just the thought of
what I saw in there

49:22.304 --> 49:25.514
is--is--is making me
kind of lightheaded.

49:28.689 --> 49:29.967
Sure.

49:32.452 --> 49:37.077
Never knew coyotes
to behave like this.

49:37.181 --> 49:38.803
Once in a while you hear
about them eating a little dog,

49:38.906 --> 49:41.219
but this is fucking nuts.

49:41.323 --> 49:42.393
Don't worry about it.

49:42.496 --> 49:45.499
Shit. It's me.

49:45.603 --> 49:46.742
I'm sorry. Sorry.

49:46.845 --> 49:48.675
Oh! Oh, it's Devon.

49:48.778 --> 49:50.504
- Who?
- He's our pest guy.

49:50.608 --> 49:52.506
Our pest control guy.

49:52.610 --> 49:53.887
Devon. Devon, thank God.

49:53.991 --> 49:55.544
Uh-huh, you called?

49:55.647 --> 49:56.890
I did?

49:56.994 --> 49:58.167
Shit, I did.

49:58.271 --> 50:00.549
Fourteen times.
I'm sorry, but listen, <i>listen.</i>

50:00.652 --> 50:03.414
<i>We could really use
your help right now.</i>

50:03.517 --> 50:06.037
You need to give the poison
time to work.

50:06.141 --> 50:08.419
Not gonna happen overnight.

50:08.522 --> 50:13.044
Three to 10 days to fully
get rid of your problem.

50:13.148 --> 50:15.150
It's not the rats.

50:15.253 --> 50:18.567
We have a crazy
situation here.

50:18.670 --> 50:21.156
I'm having a real situation
here too,

50:21.259 --> 50:23.675
with someone calling me
on my night off.

50:23.779 --> 50:26.368
No, no, no, no.
It's coyotes.

50:26.471 --> 50:28.818
I will be there before sunrise
to check the rat traps.

50:28.922 --> 50:29.888
<i>Devon.</i>

50:29.992 --> 50:31.407
Night-night.

50:41.728 --> 50:43.868
Shit.

50:43.971 --> 50:45.628
That sounded like it went well.

50:47.458 --> 50:48.700
We gotta get out of here.

50:50.599 --> 50:51.462
Okay.

50:52.566 --> 50:53.395
What?

50:53.498 --> 50:55.017
As soon as we get out there,

50:55.121 --> 50:59.159
you better move
your goddamn ass.

50:59.263 --> 51:01.541
It's a good thing
I'm a fast runner.

51:01.644 --> 51:02.576
What? I am.

51:12.931 --> 51:14.105
That's not good.

51:24.978 --> 51:26.911
Oh, shit. Jesus!

51:29.051 --> 51:30.432
Fucking bitch!

51:32.813 --> 51:33.607
<i>Fuck!</i>

51:36.196 --> 51:38.612
-  You...
-  Julie.

51:38.716 --> 51:43.203
You killed my client
before he Venmoed me.

51:43.307 --> 51:45.136
And he was a regular.

51:45.240 --> 51:47.725
Okay. That's--that's good.

51:47.828 --> 51:48.726
That's good.

51:48.829 --> 51:49.761
You got him.

51:49.865 --> 51:51.142
I think he's dead.

51:51.246 --> 51:52.212
Let's go.

51:52.316 --> 51:53.800
Please, please, let's go.

52:00.496 --> 52:01.739
It's not your fault, honey.

52:03.603 --> 52:04.914
No, it's not.

52:07.986 --> 52:09.574
It's all gonna be okay.

52:09.678 --> 52:10.644
Come here.

52:21.862 --> 52:23.899
Charlie. It's Charlie, Mom.

52:24.002 --> 52:25.694
Yes.

52:27.523 --> 52:28.938
Charlie.

52:29.042 --> 52:30.526
Charlie.

52:33.150 --> 52:35.152
Get him, baby. Get him.

52:35.255 --> 52:37.257
Oh, God! Come on!

52:40.157 --> 52:41.261
Honey.

52:42.020 --> 52:43.090
What is that?

52:43.194 --> 52:44.920
It's gonna get inside.

52:45.023 --> 52:47.094
We're gonna be okay.

52:47.198 --> 52:48.855
What is making them so crazy?

52:53.170 --> 52:54.447
Holy shit.

52:54.550 --> 52:56.690
- Oh, fuck.
- It's the chemtrails.

52:58.658 --> 52:59.935
The what?

53:00.038 --> 53:03.283
You know those long strings
of white puffy clouds

53:03.387 --> 53:04.733
behind airplanes?
- Yeah, yeah.

53:04.836 --> 53:07.805
Okay. Those are chemicals
that the government

53:07.908 --> 53:10.532
is dumping into the atmosphere
to mind control us,

53:10.635 --> 53:12.016
but it's killing all the bees

53:12.119 --> 53:14.363
and it's driving
all the animals crazy.

53:14.467 --> 53:15.709
You know, it's like
in that movie,

53:15.813 --> 53:17.918
you know, the one where
all the birds attack everyone.

53:18.022 --> 53:20.058
What's it called?
Um...

53:20.162 --> 53:21.612
The one with all the birds.

53:22.820 --> 53:24.477
The Birds?

53:24.580 --> 53:25.892
<i>No, that's not the one.</i>

53:25.995 --> 53:27.411
<i>It reminds me of this moment.</i>

53:27.514 --> 53:29.067
<i>But you know,</i> where the birds
are coming out her head?

53:29.171 --> 53:30.310
And it's really,
it's an iconic movie.

53:30.414 --> 53:31.415
Why don't you know
the name of it?

53:31.518 --> 53:33.140
I'm pretty sure it's The Birds.

53:33.244 --> 53:34.452
<i>No, .</i>

53:34.556 --> 53:35.902
Oh, man, it's gonna
come to me later.

53:36.005 --> 53:36.937
Yeah, agree to disagree.

53:37.041 --> 53:40.078
Let's--could you give me
the keys?

53:40.182 --> 53:41.770
Oh, fuck!

53:41.873 --> 53:42.840
What?

53:42.943 --> 53:45.670
Oh, God.
The fucking--

53:45.774 --> 53:49.226
The gate isn't gonna open
because the power is out.

53:49.329 --> 53:50.951
Oh, shit.

53:51.055 --> 53:53.885
Oh, God. My bad.

53:53.989 --> 53:55.232
Ever been off roading?

53:58.062 --> 53:59.339
No.

53:59.443 --> 54:00.754
<i>Hold on.</i>

54:02.169 --> 54:04.758
<i>Slow down. Oh, no.</i>

54:08.693 --> 54:10.730
You couldn't have
just parked it?

54:11.869 --> 54:12.870
Sorry.

54:12.973 --> 54:14.043
We needed the force

54:14.147 --> 54:15.907
- Oh, my God.
- to go through the gate.

54:16.011 --> 54:16.943
Are you okay?

54:17.046 --> 54:19.532
- Barely.
-  <i>Sorry.</i>

54:19.635 --> 54:21.085
<i>Told you I'd never gone
off roading.</i>

54:21.188 --> 54:22.914
Don't sue me.
Remember, I--

54:23.018 --> 54:23.984
remember I saved you.

54:26.539 --> 54:30.301
Oh, shit. I gotta go see
a chiropractor.

54:37.757 --> 54:39.724
<i>Oh, fuck.</i>
- Oh, my God.

54:40.725 --> 54:42.693
Get the fuck off my husband!

54:55.119 --> 54:56.672
Hey, babe.

54:56.776 --> 54:57.880
Let's go inside.

54:59.537 --> 55:01.884
Liv, is that you?

55:01.988 --> 55:04.853
You look like a superhero.

55:22.836 --> 55:25.701
Chloe, close the door.
Close the door.

55:25.805 --> 55:26.978
Quick, Chloe.

55:27.082 --> 55:28.842
You got it.
Oh, good.

55:30.603 --> 55:31.983
<i>Hey. Hey, guys.</i>

55:33.399 --> 55:34.676
What have you two been up to?

55:34.779 --> 55:36.229
Uh, yeah.
Just--just hanging out.

55:38.438 --> 55:39.646
Liv.

55:39.750 --> 55:41.130
Julie.

55:41.234 --> 55:42.235
Bet you didn't think
your weekend

55:42.339 --> 55:43.892
would turn out like this.

55:43.995 --> 55:46.170
Honestly, in my line of work,
you never know.

55:46.273 --> 55:47.240
Oh.

55:47.344 --> 55:48.793
Oh, is that Charlie?

55:48.897 --> 55:49.932
Is he okay?

55:50.036 --> 55:51.382
He's good.

55:51.486 --> 55:53.833
-  <i>Yeah.</i>
- Yeah, he's good.

55:53.936 --> 55:54.730
It's good to see you.

55:54.834 --> 55:57.284
-  Oh, there's, uh--oh.
- Right.

55:57.388 --> 55:58.424
Hooooo.

55:58.527 --> 56:00.115
Okay. Let me help you.

56:00.218 --> 56:01.806
Oof. Is it bad?

56:01.910 --> 56:02.807
Is it bad?

56:02.911 --> 56:03.774
Uh, don't look.

56:03.877 --> 56:05.948
-  <i>Why?</i>
-  <i>Sorry. Not that bad.</i>

56:06.052 --> 56:07.260
- Why don't you want me to look?
- No, it's okay.

56:07.364 --> 56:08.192
Let's just--let's
get you upstairs.

56:08.295 --> 56:09.573
- Oh, I saw it.
- Come on.

56:09.676 --> 56:13.300
Okay. Come on.

56:13.404 --> 56:15.406
Remember your
breathing exercises.

56:15.510 --> 56:17.546
<i>Whoo. Okay.</i>

56:17.650 --> 56:18.858
<i>Oh. You're bleeding
all over the carpet.</i>

56:18.961 --> 56:20.515
<i>Oh, don't--don't.</i>

56:21.654 --> 56:27.038
So, uh, your dad...

56:27.142 --> 56:28.454
what's his deal?

56:28.557 --> 56:30.594
He's got a thing about blood.

56:30.697 --> 56:31.905
Yeah.

56:32.009 --> 56:34.356
On Thanksgiving, he, uh,

56:34.460 --> 56:36.634
he cut his finger
carving our turkey

56:36.738 --> 56:41.259
and passed out right
in the mashed potatoes.

56:41.363 --> 56:43.227
Julie chuckles]

56:47.231 --> 56:48.922
Okay. Okay.

56:50.476 --> 56:52.754
You're definitely gonna
need stitches,

56:52.857 --> 56:54.756
and probably a rabies shot.

56:54.859 --> 56:56.620
That's great.

56:56.723 --> 56:59.174
Something to look forward
to when I get out of here.

56:59.277 --> 57:00.175
Yeah.

57:02.936 --> 57:05.767
You know, Chloe thinks this
is all her fault.

57:05.870 --> 57:07.493
What? Why?

57:09.460 --> 57:12.325
She's been feeding the coyotes.

57:12.429 --> 57:13.568
She said they looked hungry.

57:13.671 --> 57:16.605
She's... she's being sweet, really.

57:16.709 --> 57:20.471
No. This is--
I don't know what this is.

57:20.575 --> 57:24.786
This is almost like some
kind of mass hysteria.

57:24.889 --> 57:28.479
It's like when those monkeys
started attacking the tourists

57:28.583 --> 57:29.549
in Thailand.

57:29.653 --> 57:31.931
Yeah, when whales ram boats.

57:32.034 --> 57:33.001
Right.

57:35.762 --> 57:38.869
Why wouldn't Chloe tell me
about the coyotes?

57:42.355 --> 57:43.701
Because you're not here.

57:46.255 --> 57:48.603
What are you talking about?

57:48.706 --> 57:50.397
You're not here.

57:50.501 --> 57:51.813
You're not with us.

57:53.642 --> 57:56.334
You're not with your daughter.

57:56.438 --> 57:57.577
You're always working.
You know?

57:57.681 --> 57:59.303
I mean, it's like if we come

57:59.406 --> 58:01.823
and try and have a conversation
with you in your office,

58:01.926 --> 58:03.065
it's like walking on eggshells.

58:03.169 --> 58:05.309
- We don't know what to say.
- I'm working.

58:05.412 --> 58:06.690
I--I--I finally
got this great--

58:06.793 --> 58:08.001
Yeah, we're aware
you're working.

58:08.105 --> 58:10.625
We are very well aware
you're working.

58:10.728 --> 58:13.179
Everything I do
is for you and Chloe.

58:13.282 --> 58:15.043
For this house, for this life.

58:15.146 --> 58:17.148
Would you rather be in
that shitty one bedroom

58:17.252 --> 58:18.633
in Koreatown?

58:18.736 --> 58:20.151
Above the noisy restaurant?

58:20.255 --> 58:21.221
Could never sleep?

58:21.325 --> 58:22.360
Fucking toilet always backing?

58:22.464 --> 58:24.535
Yes. Yes.

58:24.639 --> 58:27.573
I loved that place
because we were with you.

58:30.472 --> 58:31.991
We were with you.

58:37.928 --> 58:39.067
We miss you.

58:41.621 --> 58:43.140
Scott?
- What?

58:45.901 --> 58:48.801
When you left Trip's,
was it on fire?

58:50.285 --> 58:51.320
Huh?

59:07.544 --> 59:08.890
It's important to not panic.

59:08.993 --> 59:11.686
We just have to figure
out a way off this hill,

59:11.789 --> 59:12.859
and we're going
to get off this hill.

59:12.963 --> 59:14.620
Okay?
I know it looks bad outside,

59:14.723 --> 59:16.069
but there are roads
that are open,

59:16.173 --> 59:17.795
and we just have
to contact somebody.

59:17.899 --> 59:20.349
So any working cell phones,
iPads, anything?

59:20.453 --> 59:21.627
<i>No. Everything's dead.</i>

59:21.730 --> 59:23.145
Chloe. You have no juice?

59:23.249 --> 59:24.043
No.

59:24.146 --> 59:25.320
You really have no juice?

59:25.423 --> 59:26.597
Yeah. I mean, I used it.

59:26.701 --> 59:27.633
Okay, that's okay.
That's okay.

59:27.736 --> 59:29.220
Um...
-  Sorry.

59:29.324 --> 59:30.946
Excuse me? I'm so--

59:31.050 --> 59:32.120
...and we are...

59:32.223 --> 59:33.121
What?

59:33.224 --> 59:34.812
You had a phone this whole time
that works?

59:34.916 --> 59:37.574
Yeah. I was charging it
in Trip's car

59:37.677 --> 59:39.265
when those wolves
started coming around.

59:39.368 --> 59:40.611
First of all,
they're coyotes.

59:40.715 --> 59:41.854
Secondly--
- Okay, whatever.

59:41.957 --> 59:43.925
I doubt Trip cared if they
were coyotes or cows

59:44.028 --> 59:45.512
when they were eating his lungs.

59:45.616 --> 59:47.411
They ate his lungs?

59:47.514 --> 59:48.757
No, no, no, honey.

59:48.861 --> 59:50.207
They ate some
of his lungs, but he was dead.

59:50.310 --> 59:51.553
All right? He died peacefully.
- That didn't happen.

59:51.657 --> 59:52.519
<i>I heard him screaming.</i>

59:52.623 --> 59:54.142
He died very peacefully.

59:54.245 --> 59:57.214
Doesn't matter.
Can I borrow it, please?

59:57.317 --> 59:58.387
For what?

59:58.491 --> 01:00:00.873
For an emergency call

01:00:00.976 --> 01:00:05.360
because of the emergency
we're all experiencing.

01:00:05.463 --> 01:00:06.499
Okay, sure.

01:00:06.603 --> 01:00:07.742
Oh, God bless you.

01:00:09.329 --> 01:00:11.124
You're at 86%?

01:00:11.228 --> 01:00:12.022
What?!

01:00:12.125 --> 01:00:14.162
Yeah. Excuse me
for being responsible.

01:00:16.371 --> 01:00:17.821
I'm stunned.

01:00:17.924 --> 01:00:18.753
<i>Please hold--</i>

01:00:18.856 --> 01:00:20.271
Oh shit. Okay.

01:00:20.375 --> 01:00:22.066
I'm--I'm--I'm on hold.

01:00:22.170 --> 01:00:25.829
Can you do me a huge favor
and just stay on the phone?

01:00:25.932 --> 01:00:27.140
We're on hold.
- Mm-hm.

01:00:27.244 --> 01:00:29.660
Remember the emergency.
Take a look outside.

01:00:29.764 --> 01:00:30.661
Okay?
- Yeah.

01:00:30.765 --> 01:00:31.938
All right.

01:00:32.042 --> 01:00:34.009
More ideas,
and there are no bad ideas.

01:00:34.113 --> 01:00:35.839
Just throw them out.
Just--

01:00:35.942 --> 01:00:37.772
What if we build a cage?

01:00:37.875 --> 01:00:39.187
Oh. I know I said
there are no bad ideas,

01:00:39.290 --> 01:00:40.671
and I love that
you're using your brain.

01:00:40.775 --> 01:00:42.121
But how would we ever build
one big enough

01:00:42.224 --> 01:00:44.917
to fit all the coyotes inside
and to get them to go in it?

01:00:45.020 --> 01:00:46.435
Keep it going. Okay,
I don't mean to be negative--

01:00:46.539 --> 01:00:47.747
But it wouldn't be for them.

01:00:47.851 --> 01:00:50.508
It'd be for us, like,
like a shark cage.

01:00:50.612 --> 01:00:52.234
Yeah.

01:00:52.338 --> 01:00:53.201
That could work.

01:00:53.304 --> 01:00:54.271
No way.

01:00:54.374 --> 01:00:55.513
I--I could build it.

01:00:55.617 --> 01:00:56.722
I could.
- No, honey. You know what?

01:00:56.825 --> 01:00:57.930
It doesn't come
with instructions,

01:00:58.033 --> 01:00:59.103
and you're not very good
with your hands.

01:00:59.207 --> 01:01:00.484
I know you want
to be that person.

01:01:00.587 --> 01:01:02.072
I see it in your--
- I am that person.

01:01:02.175 --> 01:01:03.452
Hey, hey, hey.
Where are we?

01:01:03.556 --> 01:01:05.006
What's the address?
- Oh, okay, okay.

01:01:05.109 --> 01:01:08.354
Six-two--

01:01:23.162 --> 01:01:25.164
<i>The call just dropped.</i>

01:01:26.268 --> 01:01:27.373
Fuck.

01:01:27.476 --> 01:01:29.720
<i>I forgot
to close the window.</i>

01:01:36.140 --> 01:01:40.248
Hide.

01:02:04.065 --> 01:02:08.310
Where is Chloe?

01:02:08.414 --> 01:02:13.281
Under the stairs.

01:02:19.874 --> 01:02:21.530
Oh, fuck.

01:03:39.677 --> 01:03:41.231
Chloe.

01:03:45.235 --> 01:03:46.374
Go.

01:04:22.548 --> 01:04:23.929
Chloe, run!

01:04:31.350 --> 01:04:32.282
Stay.

01:04:34.387 --> 01:04:35.561
Heel.

01:04:35.664 --> 01:04:37.390
Stay.

01:04:37.494 --> 01:04:38.529
Stay.

01:04:38.633 --> 01:04:40.186
Heel.

01:04:40.290 --> 01:04:41.947
Sit. Sit.

01:04:42.050 --> 01:04:44.466
Liv! Liv!
- No, Scott!

01:04:44.570 --> 01:04:47.366
No.

01:04:51.577 --> 01:04:53.061
Scott! Help!

01:04:54.338 --> 01:04:56.409
Shit! Shit!

01:04:56.513 --> 01:04:57.997
<i>Scott!</i>

01:05:33.067 --> 01:05:34.758
Did I get it?

01:05:34.861 --> 01:05:36.311
Yeah.

01:05:44.492 --> 01:05:45.389
Go!

01:05:46.563 --> 01:05:48.289
Chloe! Hang on, kid.

01:05:48.392 --> 01:05:50.429
Chloe, Chloe.
I'm coming, kid.

01:05:50.532 --> 01:05:52.224
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God, Chloe!

01:05:52.327 --> 01:05:53.880
Scott, help me get her out.
-  <i>Um...</i>

01:05:53.984 --> 01:05:56.262
Okay. It's okay.

01:05:56.366 --> 01:05:58.023
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

01:05:58.126 --> 01:05:59.265
It's okay.
It's okay, baby.

01:05:59.369 --> 01:06:02.510
You're okay. You're okay.

01:06:02.613 --> 01:06:03.890
<i>Chloe, look at me.</i>

01:06:03.994 --> 01:06:05.478
<i>Is Charlie okay?</i>

01:06:07.342 --> 01:06:09.103
He's in the laundry.
Look in the laundry.

01:06:09.206 --> 01:06:11.001
Char--Charlie. Look for Charlie
in the laundry hamper.

01:06:11.105 --> 01:06:12.623
Okay. Oh, there he is.

01:06:12.727 --> 01:06:15.247
He's okay. He's okay.

01:06:15.350 --> 01:06:16.696
It's okay.
You did so good.

01:06:18.043 --> 01:06:20.217
I'm scared.

01:06:20.321 --> 01:06:22.047
I'm scared.
- It's okay if you're scared.

01:06:24.152 --> 01:06:25.395
<i>You're okay.</i>

01:06:25.498 --> 01:06:27.155
There's a first aid kit
in the bathroom.

01:06:27.259 --> 01:06:28.432
Go!

01:06:28.536 --> 01:06:29.744
Go!

01:06:29.847 --> 01:06:30.814
Okay.

01:06:30.917 --> 01:06:32.333
Okay. Okay. You're okay.

01:06:32.436 --> 01:06:34.783
Okay. You're okay.

01:06:34.887 --> 01:06:36.302
You're gonna be okay.

01:06:36.406 --> 01:06:38.442
<i>No, no, no, Scott!
Don't you dare.</i>

01:06:38.546 --> 01:06:43.516
<i>Oh, God. It's okay.
I'm here. I'm here. It's okay.</i>

01:06:52.663 --> 01:06:53.802
Honey.

01:06:53.906 --> 01:06:56.874
Sweetie. Chloe.

01:06:56.978 --> 01:06:57.944
Thank God.

01:06:58.048 --> 01:06:59.946
Yeah. She's doing good.

01:07:00.050 --> 01:07:01.672
I'm so sorry.

01:07:01.776 --> 01:07:03.605
I'm so sorry.

01:07:03.709 --> 01:07:05.849
What are you talking about?

01:07:05.952 --> 01:07:07.230
I shouldn't have fed them.

01:07:07.333 --> 01:07:09.370
No, no.

01:07:09.473 --> 01:07:11.510
Kiddo, you didn't do this.

01:07:11.613 --> 01:07:12.545
You didn't do this.

01:07:14.892 --> 01:07:20.450
Mom says I'm gonna have a scar
like a vampire bite.

01:07:20.553 --> 01:07:22.935
Oh, that'll be--
that'll be cool.

01:07:23.039 --> 01:07:24.833
Yeah, that's right.

01:07:24.937 --> 01:07:27.698
Vampires like a--
what did we say--

01:07:27.802 --> 01:07:29.390
a mythical lady of the night?

01:07:29.493 --> 01:07:32.738
That's a euphemism
for a prostitute

01:07:32.841 --> 01:07:34.429
dating back to the 17th century.

01:07:34.533 --> 01:07:38.261
Oh. I didn't even know
you were here.

01:07:38.364 --> 01:07:40.711
Hey, thank you, Julie.

01:07:40.815 --> 01:07:41.747
You're welcome.

01:07:44.336 --> 01:07:46.890
Honey, I'm gonna
talk to your dad a minute.

01:07:46.993 --> 01:07:48.650
Why don't you rest?
Okay?

01:07:50.445 --> 01:07:51.584
Okay.

01:07:54.415 --> 01:07:56.279
No one is coming for us.

01:07:56.382 --> 01:07:57.797
We have to get her to the ER.

01:08:03.079 --> 01:08:05.736
Hey. Build it.

01:08:12.157 --> 01:08:13.606
<i>Okay, I can do this.</i>

01:08:13.710 --> 01:08:15.263
I can do this.

01:08:23.892 --> 01:08:26.585
Let's see here.
Some music.

01:08:26.688 --> 01:08:27.724
80s badgers.

01:08:27.827 --> 01:08:29.243
80s badgers?
80s bangers.

01:08:29.346 --> 01:08:30.589
That's perfect.

01:08:46.570 --> 01:08:48.917
What--what is all that noise?

01:08:50.885 --> 01:08:51.817
Your dad's building something.

01:08:55.683 --> 01:08:56.718
Is that safe?

01:09:03.139 --> 01:09:04.657
Fuck.

01:09:06.625 --> 01:09:09.490
90s jams.

01:09:09.593 --> 01:09:10.663
That'll do.

01:09:21.916 --> 01:09:23.159
This is kind of wrong.

01:09:25.299 --> 01:09:27.577
Okay... okay.

01:10:12.725 --> 01:10:13.726
Liv.

01:10:14.969 --> 01:10:16.729
Liv, you hear me up there?

01:10:20.940 --> 01:10:22.287
<i>Yeah, I hear you.</i>

01:10:28.362 --> 01:10:32.366
I just wanna say...
you were right.

01:10:35.265 --> 01:10:37.888
I've treated you guys
like background art

01:10:37.992 --> 01:10:39.787
of some stupid comic--

01:10:44.757 --> 01:10:45.758
And I'm so sorry.

01:10:48.796 --> 01:10:51.419
And Chloe,

01:10:51.523 --> 01:10:54.560
I don't even remember
when she stopped calling me Dad.

01:10:54.664 --> 01:10:56.010
Started calling me Scott.

01:10:58.254 --> 01:10:59.841
I just kind of ignored it.

01:11:05.709 --> 01:11:08.609
And I see the way you
look at me and I...

01:11:08.712 --> 01:11:12.820
and I know you're just bracing
for disappointment.

01:11:12.923 --> 01:11:14.062
And I'm so sorry.

01:11:18.929 --> 01:11:19.965
Liv?

01:11:21.207 --> 01:11:22.519
Sorry, Scott.
I...I didn't catch that.

01:11:22.623 --> 01:11:23.693
Can you say that again?

01:11:26.385 --> 01:11:27.455
Really?

01:11:27.559 --> 01:11:30.493
Yeah, it was just
.

01:11:30.596 --> 01:11:34.945
Uh...

01:11:35.049 --> 01:11:38.673
No, I just--I was—
when did it cut out?

01:11:38.777 --> 01:11:41.435
I heard “I want to,”
and then nothing.

01:11:41.538 --> 01:11:44.300
Oh .

01:11:44.403 --> 01:11:50.409
I was just saying
I want to... go on a trip

01:11:50.513 --> 01:11:51.514
<i>when all this is over.</i>

01:11:51.617 --> 01:11:52.584
<i>That'd be really nice.</i>

01:11:52.687 --> 01:11:54.413
<i>We haven't done that
in a long time.</i>

01:11:54.517 --> 01:11:56.898
Yeah, I'd really like that.

01:11:57.002 --> 01:11:57.865
<i>That'd be fun.</i>

01:12:00.177 --> 01:12:02.421
Okay.

01:12:02.525 --> 01:12:03.974
Okay, I'll see--
I'll see you soon.

01:12:11.672 --> 01:12:13.087
<i>Someone's coming.</i>

01:12:13.190 --> 01:12:14.709
Someone's coming.

01:12:14.813 --> 01:12:18.644
Oh, someone's coming.

01:12:23.408 --> 01:12:24.857
He doesn't know.

01:12:24.961 --> 01:12:26.411
We have to warn him.

01:12:26.514 --> 01:12:27.895
No, no, no. Don't!

01:12:33.245 --> 01:12:34.280
He's a professional.

01:12:34.384 --> 01:12:36.144
He'll be fine.

01:12:45.878 --> 01:12:48.916
Welcome to Hollywood.

01:12:52.782 --> 01:12:55.025
Ah, Jesus.

01:12:59.582 --> 01:13:01.411
Storms shut down the hills,

01:13:01.515 --> 01:13:05.795
but I snaked through
the back roads like a rat.

01:13:09.246 --> 01:13:11.663
End of days.

01:13:21.673 --> 01:13:23.157
Look at what we got here.

01:13:24.917 --> 01:13:26.056
You boys thirsty?

01:13:42.763 --> 01:13:45.559
<i>No, get away.
It's not safe.</i>

01:13:47.906 --> 01:13:49.942
<i>They're gonna fucking kill you.</i>

01:13:50.046 --> 01:13:50.943
<i>Get back in the van!</i>

01:13:51.047 --> 01:13:52.635
<i>Don't be a hero.</i>

01:13:52.738 --> 01:13:53.808
What's going on up there?

01:13:53.912 --> 01:13:56.086
<i>The pest control guy
is here.</i>

01:13:56.190 --> 01:13:58.399
- What? He is?
-  <i>Yes.</i>

01:13:58.503 --> 01:13:59.987
Should I--should I keep going?

01:14:15.589 --> 01:14:18.074
You want to dance,
you four legged freak?!

01:14:21.905 --> 01:14:24.149
Come at me. Hey.

01:14:27.186 --> 01:14:29.257
What are you doing?!

01:14:29.361 --> 01:14:32.882
You're gonna miss
the K-9 barbecue!

01:14:41.891 --> 01:14:42.892
Oh, my--!

01:14:49.174 --> 01:14:50.486
Oh, my God!

01:14:52.280 --> 01:14:53.592
Oh, no. I can't see this.

01:14:53.696 --> 01:14:55.249
Oh, don't. Yeah,
you don't want to see this.

01:15:03.119 --> 01:15:04.085
What's going on?

01:15:07.917 --> 01:15:10.091
<i>Think they got him.</i>

01:15:13.750 --> 01:15:15.441
Look, I don't know
how your little invention

01:15:15.545 --> 01:15:18.065
is coming along,
but you might want to hurry

01:15:18.168 --> 01:15:20.343
<i>or it's gonna
be fucking useless.</i>

01:15:20.446 --> 01:15:23.242
Well, you can't rush
a masterpiece.

01:15:23.346 --> 01:15:25.590
Yes, you can!

01:15:39.914 --> 01:15:41.606
Is Charlie with you guys?

01:15:43.642 --> 01:15:45.195
<i>Yeah, he's here
with Chloe.</i>

01:15:47.888 --> 01:15:49.061
Okay.

01:15:56.586 --> 01:15:57.449
What?

01:16:07.286 --> 01:16:08.943
Is this a bad idea?

01:16:09.875 --> 01:16:11.359
This is definitely a bad idea.

01:16:27.721 --> 01:16:29.654
This is great.

01:16:29.757 --> 01:16:31.966
This is a great idea.

01:16:40.009 --> 01:16:42.183
Oh, my God.

01:16:46.705 --> 01:16:48.811
What are you--oh.

01:16:48.914 --> 01:16:53.194
Did you get trapped in here by
that mean pest control guy?

01:16:53.298 --> 01:16:55.162
Come here.
Oh, my God.

01:16:55.265 --> 01:16:57.233
Were you the one
making all that noise?

01:16:58.993 --> 01:17:01.996
That's okay.
That's okay.

01:17:02.100 --> 01:17:04.171
We shouldn't be hanging out
in here.

01:17:05.655 --> 01:17:07.139
Gotta get you out of here.

01:17:07.243 --> 01:17:08.037
There's a fire coming.

01:17:08.140 --> 01:17:10.004
We're gonna--we're gonna
come back for you.

01:17:10.108 --> 01:17:12.489
Okay? All right.

01:17:12.593 --> 01:17:13.939
Come on, buddy.

01:17:14.043 --> 01:17:15.458
I got you.

01:17:15.561 --> 01:17:16.977
God, I hope you like Charlie.

01:17:21.188 --> 01:17:22.741
They just wanted their puppies.

01:17:22.845 --> 01:17:24.605
That's why they were so pissed.

01:17:24.709 --> 01:17:27.815
<i>What? Is the cage built?</i>

01:17:27.919 --> 01:17:32.717
Pretty much, but um,
I gotta do this on my own.

01:17:32.820 --> 01:17:34.615
<i>Dad, this was
a really bad idea,</i>

01:17:34.719 --> 01:17:38.170
<i>and sharks break
into cages sometimes.</i>

01:17:38.274 --> 01:17:41.070
<i>Don't do this.</i>
- It's gonna be fine.

01:17:41.173 --> 01:17:46.006
Chloe, this was your idea,
and it's gonna work.

01:17:46.109 --> 01:17:47.041
It's gonna work.

01:17:50.251 --> 01:17:51.701
It's gonna work.

01:18:19.695 --> 01:18:22.870
Okay, nice and easy.

01:18:22.974 --> 01:18:27.185
Oh, it works.

01:18:27.288 --> 01:18:28.738
There he is.

01:18:28.842 --> 01:18:30.084
Do you see?

01:18:31.948 --> 01:18:34.330
I see something.

01:18:40.025 --> 01:18:42.959
Hey, I've got something
you want.

01:18:43.063 --> 01:18:44.685
You want to make a trade?

01:18:48.827 --> 01:18:50.726
<i>You wanna make a trade?</i>

01:18:50.829 --> 01:18:52.279
He didn't have instructions.

01:18:52.382 --> 01:18:54.246
<i>I got something you want.</i>

01:18:54.350 --> 01:18:56.283
He did good.

01:18:56.386 --> 01:18:58.388
Ah! Pig!

01:18:58.492 --> 01:19:00.563
Shit! Stop!
You turn your--

01:19:00.666 --> 01:19:02.530
My God!
I can't watch this.

01:19:02.634 --> 01:19:04.187
Please stop. Stop it!

01:19:04.291 --> 01:19:06.880
Oh, fuck.

01:19:06.983 --> 01:19:08.295
Oh, me neither.

01:19:16.786 --> 01:19:18.512
What does that mean?

01:19:18.615 --> 01:19:21.135
I wish you guys could translate
what just happened.

01:19:23.482 --> 01:19:25.484
Oh, my God.

01:19:27.210 --> 01:19:28.660
Mm-mm.

01:19:29.834 --> 01:19:32.526
Guys, I'm gonna make
the hand off.

01:19:32.629 --> 01:19:36.668
Chloe, <i>this is gonna work.</i>

01:19:36.772 --> 01:19:39.291
Dad, don't do this.

01:19:41.984 --> 01:19:44.227
Just have faith
in your old man.

01:19:44.331 --> 01:19:45.746
Okay.

01:19:48.714 --> 01:19:50.095
I hope those
aren't my last words.

01:19:51.856 --> 01:19:53.271
Come on.

01:19:59.795 --> 01:20:01.175
Come on, Dad.

01:20:10.529 --> 01:20:12.014
Here we go, guys.

01:20:12.117 --> 01:20:13.705
You ready to go home?

01:20:13.809 --> 01:20:15.327
I know I am.

01:20:16.535 --> 01:20:19.021
Oops, sorry.
All right.

01:20:20.677 --> 01:20:22.127
<i>Nice and easy.</i>

01:20:22.231 --> 01:20:23.611
<i>Go ahead.</i>

01:20:25.821 --> 01:20:30.480
Okay. Nice and easy.
Nice and easy.

01:20:32.448 --> 01:20:33.414
Want to make a trade.

01:20:36.762 --> 01:20:39.524
Okay. Okay... Easy.

01:20:45.392 --> 01:20:47.601
Just... easy.

01:20:47.704 --> 01:20:50.604
Easy. Relax.

01:21:00.959 --> 01:21:04.031
Okay. All right.

01:21:04.135 --> 01:21:06.378
They were under my house.
I didn't put them there.

01:21:09.968 --> 01:21:11.349
<i>Nice and easy.</i>

01:21:13.109 --> 01:21:15.215
<i>And we're all gonna live
happily ever after.</i>

01:21:16.561 --> 01:21:18.528
<i>I know you just want
to keep your family safe.</i>

01:21:20.496 --> 01:21:21.566
Me too.

01:21:26.364 --> 01:21:29.436
Your family for mine.
Okay?

01:21:35.925 --> 01:21:38.134
You're gonna go home.

01:21:38.238 --> 01:21:40.033
Go back to your family.

01:21:40.136 --> 01:21:41.793
I'm gonna go back to mine.

01:21:41.897 --> 01:21:43.277
Come on.

01:21:43.381 --> 01:21:44.416
You got this.

01:21:49.697 --> 01:21:50.595
Come on, Dad.

01:22:05.403 --> 01:22:06.438
Come on.

01:22:09.269 --> 01:22:11.029
Here you go, bud.

01:22:11.927 --> 01:22:13.445
Here you go.

01:22:15.482 --> 01:22:17.725
Good? Good.

01:22:17.829 --> 01:22:19.969
Okay. Okay, buddy.

01:22:20.073 --> 01:22:21.246
You're gonna go home.

01:22:44.166 --> 01:22:45.581
<i>Chloe, it worked.</i>

01:22:45.684 --> 01:22:47.445
<i>Oh, my God!</i>

01:22:47.548 --> 01:22:48.549
Honey, he did it.

01:22:54.762 --> 01:22:57.075
You can come out now.

01:22:57.179 --> 01:22:58.180
We're gonna get out
of this hill.

01:22:58.283 --> 01:22:59.560
<i>Oh, honey.</i>

01:23:03.288 --> 01:23:05.049
All right, let's get the fuck
out of here.

01:24:03.969 --> 01:24:05.316
Oh.

01:24:21.677 --> 01:24:22.954
fuck me!

01:24:25.922 --> 01:24:26.923
Get off me!

01:24:33.896 --> 01:24:35.139
We had a deal!

01:24:41.628 --> 01:24:44.044
You okay?

01:24:44.148 --> 01:24:46.598
I thought you had a thing
with blood?

01:24:46.702 --> 01:24:48.117
Oh yeah.

01:24:48.221 --> 01:24:50.637
I think I'm getting over it.

01:24:50.740 --> 01:24:52.294
Come on.
- Come on.

01:24:54.986 --> 01:24:57.022
Okay.

01:24:57.126 --> 01:24:58.162
Everybody in?
Everything okay?

01:24:58.265 --> 01:24:59.715
Just drive the van!

01:24:59.818 --> 01:25:01.613
Okay. God!

Drive the van, honey.

01:25:36.924 --> 01:25:38.202
That's the fastest it goes.
It's a stick.

01:25:38.305 --> 01:25:39.548
I haven't driven a stick
in a while.

01:25:39.651 --> 01:25:41.998
Stick a couple of ladies
of the night back here.

01:25:42.102 --> 01:25:44.725
I don't think
that's appropriate.

01:25:50.317 --> 01:25:52.595
Oh, my God.

01:25:56.012 --> 01:25:57.704

01:26:05.332 --> 01:26:06.885
Not anymore.

01:26:14.997 --> 01:26:16.930
I don't care.

01:26:17.033 --> 01:26:18.656
I got everything
I need in this van.

01:26:20.761 --> 01:26:21.590
Yeah.

01:26:21.693 --> 01:26:23.799
Except for my comic book
collection.

01:26:30.357 --> 01:26:33.118
Hey, where are you going?

01:26:33.222 --> 01:26:34.741
The original Fantastic Four.

01:26:37.019 --> 01:26:37.985
Who cares?

01:26:38.089 --> 01:26:39.539
Mm-hm.

01:26:39.642 --> 01:26:45.338
Ah. And first appearance Thor.

01:26:45.441 --> 01:26:46.856
Every--everything's in the van.

01:26:46.960 --> 01:26:50.101
But yeah, we're alive.

01:26:50.205 --> 01:26:51.206
Mm-hm. Yeah.

01:26:51.309 --> 01:26:52.724
I'll get them
at some trade show.

01:26:54.036 --> 01:26:55.417
Not so fast.

01:27:02.286 --> 01:27:04.564
But maybe because I have them
in a lock box,

01:27:04.667 --> 01:27:05.944
so maybe they're protected.

01:27:06.048 --> 01:27:07.532
Just drive the van, Scott,

01:27:07.636 --> 01:27:09.810
and as far away from Hollywood
as possible.

01:27:14.574 --> 01:27:18.302
Come on.
Give me all you got.

01:27:19.958 --> 01:27:21.028
Come on!
