00:00:09.376 --> 00:00:11.044
Is Mr. Mikami here yet?

00:00:11.244 --> 00:00:14.681
Ms. Koreeda, is it true that
Mr. Mikami is leaving?

00:00:15.382 --> 00:00:17.417
I'm not entirely sure yet myself.

00:00:21.388 --> 00:00:22.555
Mr. Mikami.

00:00:22.989 --> 00:00:25.058
Is it true that you're returning
to the Ministry of Education?

00:00:25.725 --> 00:00:27.427
I see word spreads fast.

00:00:27.527 --> 00:00:29.129
Could you please explain?

00:00:29.596 --> 00:00:31.898
My colleague collapsed and
they can't manage the workload.

00:00:31.998 --> 00:00:34.968
So the Ministry approached the school
and requested that I return.

00:00:38.805 --> 00:00:40.740
I'm going to talk to Mr. Mizohata.

00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:42.609
– Why don't we talk about it first?
– But...

00:00:42.709 --> 00:00:44.377
There's more.

00:00:45.278 --> 00:00:48.448
It was implied that I might be
removed as homeroom teacher

00:00:48.548 --> 00:00:49.549
if I don't go back.

00:00:50.283 --> 00:00:51.284
Why?

00:00:51.985 --> 00:00:54.687
It might be because
your test scores are dropping.

00:00:54.954 --> 00:00:56.356
What? No way.

00:00:57.457 --> 00:00:59.726
Apparently, some parents
are raising concerns.

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:03.163
Well, it's a legitimate reason
since you're all exam students.

00:01:03.263 --> 00:01:05.231
But if that happens...

00:01:05.331 --> 00:01:07.367
I either get forcibly transferred
back to the Ministry of Education

00:01:07.467 --> 00:01:10.036
or stay on as co-homeroom teacher
with Ms. Koreeda taking over.

00:01:10.136 --> 00:01:11.538
Hold on a second.

00:01:12.172 --> 00:01:16.009
I've been prepared to take over
as homeroom teacher at any time.

00:01:16.176 --> 00:01:18.678
But accepting such an arbitrary
personnel decision

00:01:18.778 --> 00:01:19.979
from the schools
is a different issue.

00:01:21.381 --> 00:01:23.149
Ms. Koreeda is absolutely right.

00:01:23.516 --> 00:01:24.517
We absolutely must not allow

00:01:24.584 --> 00:01:25.785
a precedent to be set
where a homeroom teacher is replaced

00:01:25.885 --> 00:01:27.387
just because
the class's grades aren't improving.

00:01:27.487 --> 00:01:29.656
Weren't you the one who wanted
the teacher changed?

00:01:30.290 --> 00:01:32.025
Are you still sticking with that act?

00:01:34.127 --> 00:01:37.030
You're right. Let's talk.

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:52.178
The fact that this issue is coming up

00:01:52.312 --> 00:01:54.481
probably means you've developed
the ability to think.

00:01:55.081 --> 00:01:56.149
What do you mean?

00:01:56.549 --> 00:02:00.620
Why hasn't thinking-based education
as a goal taken root?

00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:03.456
It's because you're moving away
from cram-school education

00:02:03.523 --> 00:02:04.657
that relies on rote memorization.

00:02:04.757 --> 00:02:06.793
This means that your quantifiable
academic performance

00:02:06.893 --> 00:02:09.229
in other words, your test scores,
temporarily drops.

00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:12.866
It's exemplified in the transition of
cram-free education to its removal.

00:02:13.032 --> 00:02:15.568
They couldn't manage
the extra time given

00:02:15.668 --> 00:02:17.337
so they panicked when grades dropped.

00:02:17.437 --> 00:02:21.441
They labeled it as a failure
and reverted to cramming.

00:02:21.908 --> 00:02:24.177
But it's you guys who
made that system.

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:25.411
True, that's right.

00:02:26.012 --> 00:02:29.315
But adults now didn't receive
thinking-based education, either.

00:02:29.883 --> 00:02:32.585
Meaning, today's adults lack
the ability to think, right?

00:02:33.019 --> 00:02:34.787
And those adults are the ones

00:02:34.854 --> 00:02:36.156
creating education to
foster thinking skills.

00:02:36.756 --> 00:02:38.158
I think that's really difficult.

00:02:39.259 --> 00:02:40.693
Being inside the system
made me realize that

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:43.963
to reform this country's
education system

00:02:44.063 --> 00:02:46.366
we are severely lacking
the very ability to think.

00:02:49.302 --> 00:02:52.172
We are thinking seriously, though.

00:02:53.039 --> 00:02:55.208
That's something
you taught us, isn't it?

00:02:55.308 --> 00:02:57.310
I don't think of it as me
teaching you anything.

00:02:58.111 --> 00:03:00.013
But it's only been six months
since I came to this school

00:03:00.113 --> 00:03:03.116
and it's true that you've all
changed at an incredible pace.

00:03:04.951 --> 00:03:07.654
But as a result,
our test scores have dropped.

00:03:08.688 --> 00:03:11.291
That's the part the school
is focusing on, right?

00:03:11.958 --> 00:03:14.160
We have no choice but to
get good scores in the next exam.

00:03:17.964 --> 00:03:19.599
What do you all think?

00:03:26.706 --> 00:03:31.244
Right now, even if it's for Okami

00:03:32.212 --> 00:03:34.714
I can't bring myself to
raise my grades for someone else.

00:03:34.914 --> 00:03:35.915
If I'm going to do it...

00:03:39.786 --> 00:03:41.721
I want to believe it's for myself.

00:03:44.824 --> 00:03:45.825
Right?

00:03:48.261 --> 00:03:49.262
Yeah.

00:03:51.831 --> 00:03:53.733
I don't want to participate in
some point-scoring game

00:03:54.267 --> 00:03:56.636
just to prove the school wrong.

00:04:00.873 --> 00:04:06.045
There's something Okami said
that stuck with me.

00:04:08.181 --> 00:04:11.651
That what we're aiming for
is to become "upper-class citizens."

00:04:14.120 --> 00:04:15.321
If I were on my deathbed

00:04:16.055 --> 00:04:19.192
and someone told me,
"You were an upper-class citizen"

00:04:19.559 --> 00:04:21.828
I think I'd be humiliated.

00:04:23.696 --> 00:04:25.131
A true "elite"?

00:04:25.999 --> 00:04:29.235
It's not that I want to be someone
chosen by God or anything.

00:04:30.737 --> 00:04:32.772
But if I only get one life

00:04:33.673 --> 00:04:37.176
part of me wants to be someone
who's at least useful to others.

00:04:40.046 --> 00:04:43.416
Entrance exams are not the goal,
they're the means.

00:04:45.385 --> 00:04:46.386
But...

00:04:46.986 --> 00:04:48.821
Or rather, precisely because of that
I think it's meaningful

00:04:50.123 --> 00:04:54.294
that we aim for Tokyo University
with that understanding.

00:04:56.195 --> 00:04:57.597
I think so too.

00:04:58.364 --> 00:05:01.501
And I couldn't care less about
my personal pride.

00:05:02.802 --> 00:05:07.273
I just want these next three months
of your lives to be meaningful.

00:05:08.908 --> 00:05:10.443
That's my only wish.

00:05:16.249 --> 00:05:19.919
There's something I've been
thinking for a while now.

00:05:20.553 --> 00:05:21.788
Will you share it?

00:05:24.390 --> 00:05:25.858
Lately, I've been wondering
if we could

00:05:25.958 --> 00:05:29.262
share our study methods
with each other?

00:05:29.662 --> 00:05:31.664
I want to enrich the
experience of studying itself.

00:05:31.831 --> 00:05:34.701
In that aspect,
I have a lot I'd love to share.

00:05:34.801 --> 00:05:37.003
That's a good idea.
I want to do that.

00:05:37.070 --> 00:05:38.171
I want to try it.

00:05:40.340 --> 00:05:41.474
Let me summarize.

00:05:42.675 --> 00:05:46.012
We'll come up with
our own study methods.

00:05:46.479 --> 00:05:49.382
And while we're at it,
we'll save Okami.

00:05:49.515 --> 00:05:50.817
How does that sound?

00:05:51.084 --> 00:05:52.885
Sounds great!

00:05:53.553 --> 00:05:55.088
You'll help us, right?

00:05:55.722 --> 00:05:57.156
If needed, of course.

00:05:58.291 --> 00:05:59.292
You too, Ms. Koreeda?

00:06:03.730 --> 00:06:06.032
All right, let's do this!

00:06:07.133 --> 00:06:08.134
Let's go for it.

00:06:15.942 --> 00:06:21.948
MR. MIKAMI'S CLASSROOM

00:06:23.116 --> 00:06:24.517
Mr. Mizohata.

00:06:24.717 --> 00:06:27.720
You understand, right?
This is your last chance.

00:06:28.855 --> 00:06:30.923
Of course, I understand.

00:06:31.023 --> 00:06:33.726
Now that you've played the card of

00:06:34.427 --> 00:06:36.162
demoting a
bureaucrat-appointed teacher...

00:06:36.229 --> 00:06:38.464
there's no turning back.

00:06:39.499 --> 00:06:40.500
Is that clear?

00:06:41.567 --> 00:06:42.568
Yes, sir.

00:06:42.869 --> 00:06:43.870
Okay.

00:06:51.611 --> 00:06:52.612
Chairman Kodai.

00:06:54.647 --> 00:06:55.815
What is it?

00:06:58.317 --> 00:07:00.586
Chairman, you once asked me...

00:07:01.821 --> 00:07:04.924
if there was a way for me to be saved
saved if you collapsed.

00:07:07.560 --> 00:07:10.430
When I heard that,
I thought to myself.

00:07:12.331 --> 00:07:13.800
Would there ever be a case

00:07:13.866 --> 00:07:18.704
where only I collapse and
you walk away clean?

00:07:20.940 --> 00:07:22.508
So what about it?

00:07:25.711 --> 00:07:28.981
I know a lot of things.

00:07:31.083 --> 00:07:33.252
You can't just cut off
the lizard's tail

00:07:34.720 --> 00:07:36.789
and expect that to be
the end of it.

00:07:40.092 --> 00:07:41.394
What are you talking about?

00:07:43.663 --> 00:07:45.164
It would be a big problem for you

00:07:45.231 --> 00:07:46.532
if everything
came to light, wouldn't it?

00:07:51.671 --> 00:07:52.939
For me, you mean?

00:07:55.475 --> 00:07:58.544
Or a problem for all of us?

00:08:03.716 --> 00:08:05.551
Isn't that too extreme?

00:08:05.885 --> 00:08:09.088
"Come back to the Ministry
or be replaced as homeroom teacher."

00:08:10.523 --> 00:08:11.524
Makino.

00:08:11.591 --> 00:08:14.527
Are you worried something
might happen if Mikami returns?

00:08:16.596 --> 00:08:18.965
No, not at all.

00:08:19.499 --> 00:08:22.268
It's just that both internally and
externally, the optics will be...

00:08:23.836 --> 00:08:24.937
What are you trying to say?

00:08:26.239 --> 00:08:28.541
If he were to come back
only halfway through his post

00:08:28.908 --> 00:08:31.077
it's like admitting that the
Ministry's first bureaucrat placement

00:08:31.177 --> 00:08:33.846
in a private school was a failure.

00:08:35.214 --> 00:08:37.717
In that case, if we do bring him back

00:08:38.251 --> 00:08:41.187
we will have to pair it with
an extraordinary promotion.

00:08:42.822 --> 00:08:43.823
What?

00:08:43.923 --> 00:08:46.993
What? Was that
the real issue all along?

00:08:49.962 --> 00:08:53.032
Well, I kind of get how you feel.

00:08:53.966 --> 00:08:58.204
If Mikami gets promoted here,
he'd become a division chief.

00:08:58.404 --> 00:09:03.276
Which would make him the
highest-ranking among your cohort.

00:09:04.844 --> 00:09:05.845
But you know...

00:09:06.679 --> 00:09:09.382
What's best for the whole system
is more important.

00:09:10.616 --> 00:09:13.452
You understand that,
don't you, Makino?

00:09:16.155 --> 00:09:18.691
Of course, sir.

00:09:21.260 --> 00:09:23.162
Anyway, once he's back
at the Ministry

00:09:23.262 --> 00:09:25.665
he can still be of great use.

00:09:26.132 --> 00:09:29.168
You know that
better than anyone, right?

00:09:32.371 --> 00:09:36.876
Hey, now's not the time to be
worrying about others, Makino.

00:09:40.680 --> 00:09:41.681
Excuse me.

00:09:42.315 --> 00:09:43.316
Yes.

00:09:59.532 --> 00:10:02.702
Yes, I've spoken with Makino.

00:10:03.569 --> 00:10:06.105
He seemed pretty flustered.

00:10:06.172 --> 00:10:09.475
He's quite the ambitious man.

00:10:09.675 --> 00:10:12.178
I've spoken with Mr. Mizohata, too.

00:10:12.878 --> 00:10:15.181
From here on out,
no matter who stays

00:10:15.281 --> 00:10:17.984
Mizohata is not an option.

00:10:18.517 --> 00:10:21.220
Still, he does have a mortgage

00:10:21.320 --> 00:10:24.023
and his child is preparing for
elementary school entrance exams.

00:10:24.490 --> 00:10:28.127
I don't think he'll go blabbing.

00:10:28.294 --> 00:10:32.765
If we can't bring Mikami in,
then I guess it'll have to be Makino.

00:10:33.232 --> 00:10:35.668
The question is
what to do about Nakaoka.

00:10:36.435 --> 00:10:38.371
Eventually, they'll
all become troublesome.

00:10:39.639 --> 00:10:41.340
These men know too much.

00:10:47.113 --> 00:10:49.081
– I'm home.
– Takuto.

00:10:51.250 --> 00:10:52.251
What?

00:10:53.119 --> 00:10:56.255
Have you been visiting
Mayama Yuzuru?

00:10:58.357 --> 00:10:59.358
What?

00:11:05.431 --> 00:11:07.133
This came in the mail.

00:11:07.233 --> 00:11:08.901
Mayama Yuzuru

00:11:14.707 --> 00:11:16.909
Stop playing
newspaper reporter right now.

00:11:18.511 --> 00:11:19.779
What gives you
the right to say that?

00:11:19.879 --> 00:11:20.880
This is...

00:11:24.150 --> 00:11:26.986
This isn't something to
half-heartedly dig into.

00:11:36.028 --> 00:11:37.763
I'm not doing this half-heartedly.

00:11:51.444 --> 00:11:52.978
"To Mr. Kanzaki Takuto,

00:11:54.847 --> 00:11:56.849
I'm not confident
I can calmly tell you this

00:11:57.183 --> 00:11:59.251
within the limited visitation time.

00:12:00.453 --> 00:12:03.489
So I wrote out
the story of my life until now.

00:12:06.792 --> 00:12:10.629
To be honest,
remembering it is so painful

00:12:11.797 --> 00:12:15.668
that I even start to wonder if
I'm just writing endless lies.

00:12:18.971 --> 00:12:20.139
But even so...

00:12:22.475 --> 00:12:24.877
this is everything I can recall

00:12:26.712 --> 00:12:28.781
and it is my truth.

00:12:31.550 --> 00:12:36.689
My very first memory is of
my father hitting my mother."

00:12:41.026 --> 00:12:44.897
– Stop it, please. Yuzuru is...
– Don't talk back!

00:12:50.503 --> 00:12:51.504
Yuzuru.

00:12:52.438 --> 00:12:54.707
It's okay, Yuzuru.

00:12:54.774 --> 00:12:55.875
You're okay.

00:13:12.925 --> 00:13:18.197
"I always got overwhelmed and
couldn't organize my thoughts.

00:13:19.398 --> 00:13:21.433
That started in my freshman year
of high school.

00:13:32.111 --> 00:13:34.680
'You're disliked for a reason.'

00:13:37.049 --> 00:13:38.584
That was a painful thing to hear.

00:13:41.587 --> 00:13:45.925
But what hurt even more
was knowing it was true.

00:13:48.594 --> 00:13:50.863
Why am I hated?

00:13:52.898 --> 00:13:54.934
I didn't know how to talk to people.

00:13:56.802 --> 00:13:58.571
But I was prideful.

00:14:00.739 --> 00:14:04.109
I couldn't function unless
I believed I was special."

00:14:15.154 --> 00:14:17.656
Could you pass this to the back?

00:14:31.403 --> 00:14:34.039
– Good morning.
– Good morning.

00:14:34.173 --> 00:14:36.709
I heard you all gathered early
for a strategy meeting.

00:14:36.876 --> 00:14:39.345
Mind if I record this?

00:14:39.578 --> 00:14:40.579
– Sure, go ahead.
– Yes.

00:14:44.283 --> 00:14:46.385
– All right, let's begin.
– Okay.

00:14:47.920 --> 00:14:51.290
In this class,
the basic academic ability is there.

00:14:51.557 --> 00:14:53.092
You've also completed
your Exam Matrix

00:14:53.192 --> 00:14:54.627
and understand yourselves, right?

00:14:55.661 --> 00:14:57.696
But your grades are stagnant.

00:14:58.330 --> 00:14:59.899
Why do you think that is?

00:15:00.266 --> 00:15:02.835
That's what's puzzling.

00:15:03.302 --> 00:15:05.804
– We're just getting started.
– Thanks.

00:15:06.705 --> 00:15:07.806
It's not a mystery.

00:15:09.675 --> 00:15:12.311
Our study time has
drastically decreased.

00:15:13.078 --> 00:15:14.780
But is that the only reason?

00:15:16.148 --> 00:15:17.816
Why do you say that?

00:15:22.054 --> 00:15:25.090
Personally, I don't feel like
my academic ability has dropped.

00:15:25.190 --> 00:15:27.059
That's because you've actually
been studying, Muraoka.

00:15:27.159 --> 00:15:29.261
So do you think your ability
has declined, Tokumori?

00:15:32.564 --> 00:15:35.668
In absolute terms, probably not.

00:15:36.969 --> 00:15:38.504
But my rank is slowly slipping.

00:15:40.139 --> 00:15:41.140
Hang on.

00:15:41.540 --> 00:15:43.309
I actually analyzed that a bit.

00:15:48.080 --> 00:15:51.250
I had some people share
their test results

00:15:51.350 --> 00:15:52.751
and I broke down the data.

00:15:54.320 --> 00:15:55.621
According to the analysis

00:15:55.721 --> 00:15:57.556
it's not that
our scores are dropping.

00:15:57.656 --> 00:16:02.161
It's that we've stayed
the same since our junior year.

00:16:03.295 --> 00:16:06.765
Meanwhile, other students are
studying hard and improving

00:16:06.932 --> 00:16:08.968
so naturally, our standing dropped.

00:16:12.104 --> 00:16:13.405
It's okay, keep going.

00:16:14.173 --> 00:16:16.976
We'll map this into the Exam Matrix.

00:16:18.344 --> 00:16:20.412
Wow, that's cool.

00:16:20.512 --> 00:16:23.482
And from that, each person's
current issue becomes clear.

00:16:23.816 --> 00:16:27.419
Basically, it means we need to get
back to the fundamentals of studying.

00:16:27.619 --> 00:16:28.787
But won't that just become

00:16:28.854 --> 00:16:31.323
studying for
the sake of studying again?

00:16:32.157 --> 00:16:33.459
Exactly.

00:16:33.826 --> 00:16:36.328
But we also want short-term results

00:16:36.428 --> 00:16:38.163
so we still need to
focus on efficiency.

00:16:40.599 --> 00:16:42.234
How do you study, Wakui?

00:16:42.501 --> 00:16:45.371
Honestly,
it's probably pretty inefficient.

00:16:47.539 --> 00:16:49.875
"Sui-He-Ri-Be-
Bo-Ku-No-Fune."

00:16:50.075 --> 00:16:53.345
That's a famous mnemonic for
memorizing elements, right?

00:16:53.979 --> 00:16:56.015
But I don't really use that method.

00:16:56.115 --> 00:16:57.683
Go deeper on that.

00:16:58.784 --> 00:17:00.819
For example,
when the Big Bang happened

00:17:00.919 --> 00:17:04.189
only hydrogen and helium
appeared in the universe.

00:17:04.890 --> 00:17:06.792
Hydrogen's symbol is "H"

00:17:06.892 --> 00:17:09.261
and the word "hydrogen" comes
from Greek, meaning "water's origin."

00:17:09.928 --> 00:17:12.464
The Hydra is the sea serpent
from Greek mythology.

00:17:12.564 --> 00:17:13.665
That's amazing.

00:17:14.266 --> 00:17:16.702
Just from hydrogen, you get
the origin of the universe

00:17:16.802 --> 00:17:18.303
history, and myth.

00:17:18.404 --> 00:17:20.439
And if you think of
hydrogen as energy

00:17:20.539 --> 00:17:22.141
it connects to
environmental issues too.

00:17:22.207 --> 00:17:23.575
It can go anywhere.

00:17:24.076 --> 00:17:25.244
Wow.

00:17:25.344 --> 00:17:29.448
It's said that memory peaks
when you're young, and that's true.

00:17:29.648 --> 00:17:32.651
But the brain
actually gets better as you age.

00:17:32.751 --> 00:17:34.186
Really?

00:17:34.286 --> 00:17:35.521
As your knowledge accumulates

00:17:35.621 --> 00:17:38.524
your synapses extend
and connect brain cells.

00:17:38.624 --> 00:17:40.225
That moment of connection
is called "understanding."

00:17:40.459 --> 00:17:44.196
And they say real comprehension
deepens after age 30.

00:17:45.964 --> 00:17:46.965
Though that means

00:17:47.066 --> 00:17:49.301
you have to put in a lot of effort
while you're younger.

00:17:50.269 --> 00:17:54.473
One book I read said how you approach
turning 30 is crucial.

00:17:54.573 --> 00:17:56.241
How exactly is it important?

00:17:57.309 --> 00:18:01.613
Well, I'll be turning 30 soon, so...

00:18:02.748 --> 00:18:04.750
For example, if you spend that day
reading a book

00:18:04.850 --> 00:18:06.752
you'll be able to
build a lifelong relationship

00:18:06.852 --> 00:18:08.487
with language and read deeply.

00:18:08.754 --> 00:18:11.356
That feels doable.
I'll give it a try.

00:18:11.757 --> 00:18:13.325
Wow. Thirty, huh?

00:18:13.492 --> 00:18:15.227
I'd better watch out or
I'll end up wasting it.

00:18:15.327 --> 00:18:16.328
That's true.

00:18:17.596 --> 00:18:19.631
So, Okami,
how did you spend that day?

00:18:20.099 --> 00:18:22.201
I was writing Diet replies at work

00:18:22.301 --> 00:18:23.969
and before I knew it,
it was the next day.

00:18:24.203 --> 00:18:25.537
That's awful.

00:18:25.737 --> 00:18:28.040
Everyone else had gone home,
and I was alone on that floor

00:18:28.140 --> 00:18:31.276
thinking about the future of Japan
as I turned 30.

00:18:32.044 --> 00:18:33.812
As a bureaucrat, that was
the most luxurious birthday

00:18:33.912 --> 00:18:34.913
I could've asked for.

00:18:35.180 --> 00:18:36.615
Sounds like sour grapes.

00:18:39.551 --> 00:18:42.821
That is a luxury. Don't you get it?

00:18:44.089 --> 00:18:45.257
What's wrong, Kanzaki?

00:18:55.100 --> 00:18:56.101
Nothing.

00:19:00.439 --> 00:19:01.440
Sorry.

00:19:04.710 --> 00:19:05.744
Kanzaki.

00:19:06.445 --> 00:19:07.613
Hey, Kanzaki.

00:19:07.679 --> 00:19:11.984
I'd like you to take charge of
the essay questions.

00:19:18.056 --> 00:19:19.057
Got it.

00:19:19.525 --> 00:19:23.028
All right. Let's start
right after school today.

00:19:23.862 --> 00:19:24.863
Okay.

00:19:24.963 --> 00:19:25.964
Let's do it.

00:19:37.476 --> 00:19:39.111
And there's this principle.

00:19:39.278 --> 00:19:43.682
Even vague things like human senses
can be explained mathematically.

00:19:43.782 --> 00:19:46.552
What? Logs are kind of cute.

00:19:46.652 --> 00:19:47.653
Right?

00:19:47.753 --> 00:19:48.820
When you look at it that way...

00:19:48.921 --> 00:19:51.890
Instead of staring at an English word
until you memorize it

00:19:51.990 --> 00:19:54.593
it's better to study
like a quiz game.

00:19:54.993 --> 00:19:58.230
Because it includes
the process of recalling.

00:19:58.730 --> 00:20:00.365
Active recall!

00:20:00.465 --> 00:20:01.466
Yes.

00:20:01.533 --> 00:20:06.004
Besides, adding game elements
boosts motivation for the brain.

00:20:06.171 --> 00:20:07.339
Okay, let's start right away.

00:20:07.439 --> 00:20:09.508
The students seem energized.

00:20:10.242 --> 00:20:12.177
I've got to update
my teaching methods too.

00:20:13.145 --> 00:20:15.514
Mr. Koreeda, when you were
in school, were you perhaps...

00:20:16.448 --> 00:20:18.350
It's just as you imagined.

00:20:19.218 --> 00:20:20.953
I used to
stare down my vocabulary book

00:20:21.053 --> 00:20:23.355
and wouldn't sleep until
I finished my quota.

00:20:23.689 --> 00:20:25.357
– Pure grit.
– Yes.

00:20:26.358 --> 00:20:28.393
Looking back now,
I'm kind of like a fossil.

00:20:28.493 --> 00:20:30.262
Like a platypus...

00:20:30.462 --> 00:20:32.197
You know what I mean, right?

00:20:32.864 --> 00:20:35.867
The platypus hasn't changed
since prehistoric times.

00:20:35.968 --> 00:20:38.604
In other words, it's an animal
with strong persistence.

00:20:38.870 --> 00:20:40.806
One could also say it's inflexible.

00:20:40.906 --> 00:20:42.541
Nice bit of self-deprecation.

00:20:42.674 --> 00:20:46.011
That's critical thinking.

00:20:46.578 --> 00:20:49.381
It's essential in order to
update oneself, isn't it?

00:20:50.315 --> 00:20:52.851
Okami, what is
"kyubo-shita" in English?

00:20:53.819 --> 00:20:54.820
"Indigent."

00:20:55.087 --> 00:20:56.088
Oh, nice.

00:20:56.188 --> 00:20:57.189
How about "genshoku no"?

00:20:57.489 --> 00:20:58.490
"Incumbent."

00:20:58.590 --> 00:21:00.325
Wow, impressive!

00:21:02.394 --> 00:21:06.164
Ms. Koreeda, do you know
which animal has the most endurance?

00:21:06.265 --> 00:21:07.399
I have no idea.

00:21:07.499 --> 00:21:09.468
Prepare to be surprised.
It's humans.

00:21:09.568 --> 00:21:10.969
What? No way.

00:21:11.069 --> 00:21:15.540
No animal can run 26 miles
faster than a human.

00:21:16.708 --> 00:21:19.344
We really ought to
put that endurance to use.

00:21:20.145 --> 00:21:21.546
Here's another story.

00:21:22.214 --> 00:21:24.783
There used to be a zoo that
had a cage for humans.

00:21:24.883 --> 00:21:26.418
And on the plaque, it said...

00:21:26.685 --> 00:21:27.686
Okay.

00:21:28.487 --> 00:21:30.522
"Among all animals in the world

00:21:30.589 --> 00:21:33.792
the strongest and the weakest
is the human."

00:21:38.997 --> 00:21:44.836
Right now, I feel like I'm looking at
the strongest creatures on Earth.

00:21:47.239 --> 00:21:48.407
I agree.

00:21:52.344 --> 00:21:55.514
Let's protect them, no matter what.

00:22:20.972 --> 00:22:22.774
Thank you for the tea.

00:22:42.060 --> 00:22:43.829
You should come for lessons
once in a while.

00:22:44.196 --> 00:22:47.666
It's embarrassing if my own daughter
doesn't know her manners.

00:22:51.336 --> 00:22:53.238
About what we discussed earlier...

00:22:53.705 --> 00:22:56.908
I've decided not to get involved
in the school's management.

00:22:57.676 --> 00:23:00.312
But you still donate regularly
to Rintoku, don't you?

00:23:00.946 --> 00:23:05.317
I donate simply because
I agree with Mr. Kodai's philosophy.

00:23:05.917 --> 00:23:07.619
And once you give money,
you shouldn't interfere.

00:23:07.719 --> 00:23:09.621
That's what education is.

00:23:09.721 --> 00:23:13.492
But if wrongdoing is involved,
that's a different story.

00:23:18.063 --> 00:23:21.233
It's only because of my credibility
that they accepted you.

00:23:23.668 --> 00:23:25.537
I didn't ask you to do that.

00:23:29.474 --> 00:23:32.611
You did that on your own.

00:23:39.584 --> 00:23:42.921
Reiko, your student is here.

00:23:45.190 --> 00:23:50.796
I ask that you refrain from
doing anything to shame me.

00:23:53.198 --> 00:23:55.000
I didn't choose this school
for myself.

00:23:57.169 --> 00:23:58.170
But...

00:23:59.070 --> 00:24:02.908
Rintoku has become
a special place for me.

00:24:05.010 --> 00:24:11.383
I want to protect it
and its students.

00:24:27.566 --> 00:24:28.967
Would you like some coffee?

00:24:42.714 --> 00:24:43.715
It's good.

00:24:44.449 --> 00:24:45.617
I'm glad to hear that.

00:24:46.518 --> 00:24:48.353
Your mom never drinks it.

00:24:48.553 --> 00:24:51.423
She says a tea ceremony instructor
shouldn't drink coffee.

00:24:53.124 --> 00:24:55.360
You're very patient, Dad.

00:24:55.560 --> 00:24:56.928
Well, I did marry into the family.

00:24:57.429 --> 00:24:59.164
That shouldn't matter.

00:25:01.132 --> 00:25:04.069
Hey, Dad. Do you know anything?

00:25:04.636 --> 00:25:07.072
Well, not really.

00:25:07.405 --> 00:25:10.876
But isn't everyone around here
donating to Rintoku?

00:25:11.443 --> 00:25:13.578
Your mother
takes care of all that stuff.

00:25:15.514 --> 00:25:18.216
But, if I'm not mistaken...

00:25:19.117 --> 00:25:21.686
There was something about
Mr. Koshi from the printing company.

00:25:22.320 --> 00:25:23.321
Mr. Koshi?

00:25:23.655 --> 00:25:24.656
Yes, Mr. Koshi.

00:25:25.824 --> 00:25:28.493
It's written with the characters
for "high" and "aspiration."

00:25:29.194 --> 00:25:32.264
The previous president
really admired Mr. Kodai

00:25:32.364 --> 00:25:35.133
so he brought together
everyone in this area.

00:25:36.201 --> 00:25:37.202
Koshi...

00:25:37.302 --> 00:25:41.039
Koshi Printing Company

00:25:42.140 --> 00:25:43.141
Koshi?

00:25:45.977 --> 00:25:49.214
Koshi Printing Company

00:25:54.653 --> 00:25:58.557
Back in my father's time, we were
like a cheering squad for Rintoku.

00:25:58.990 --> 00:26:01.760
But since I took over,
we haven't been in touch.

00:26:02.127 --> 00:26:05.430
Did your father leave behind
anything?

00:26:05.497 --> 00:26:06.765
Like documents, for example?

00:26:07.632 --> 00:26:11.102
He was super organized,
so he kept a list, like a registry.

00:26:12.604 --> 00:26:14.539
About six months ago,
someone from Rintoku came by

00:26:14.639 --> 00:26:15.907
and I handed it over.

00:26:16.241 --> 00:26:18.109
Do you remember that person's name?

00:26:18.543 --> 00:26:20.211
Let me see...

00:26:26.585 --> 00:26:27.652
This person.

00:26:34.893 --> 00:26:35.894
Yes?

00:26:41.099 --> 00:26:42.701
No way, it's Mr. Mikami!

00:26:42.901 --> 00:26:44.369
I just happened to be nearby.

00:26:45.971 --> 00:26:47.472
I'm really happy you came.

00:26:47.572 --> 00:26:48.707
Are you sure?

00:26:49.407 --> 00:26:51.810
I thought I might be a bother,
so I wasn't sure if I should come.

00:26:51.910 --> 00:26:52.911
Not at all.

00:26:53.712 --> 00:26:56.982
If you like, you can read this.

00:26:57.082 --> 00:26:59.551
Thank you. Sorry for the trouble.

00:27:01.786 --> 00:27:04.289
How's teaching? Is it fulfilling?

00:27:05.857 --> 00:27:07.192
Let me tell you.

00:27:08.493 --> 00:27:10.128
It really is.

00:27:10.295 --> 00:27:13.098
Is that right? I thought so.

00:27:13.765 --> 00:27:15.166
High school seniors, you know...

00:27:15.734 --> 00:27:18.970
They're not quite adults,
but not kids either.

00:27:20.071 --> 00:27:21.873
They're kind of strange creatures.

00:27:21.973 --> 00:27:24.643
– Strange?
– It's hard to explain.

00:27:25.377 --> 00:27:29.247
They have this strong life force,
yet they're incredibly delicate.

00:27:29.981 --> 00:27:32.684
And their change of pace
is as fast as plankton.

00:27:33.685 --> 00:27:35.954
You can't take your eyes
off them for even a moment.

00:27:37.022 --> 00:27:38.923
Were we like that too?

00:27:40.892 --> 00:27:42.027
There was that
business competition, right?

00:27:42.127 --> 00:27:45.530
– Yeah.
– Actually, it really moved me.

00:27:45.630 --> 00:27:47.932
Honestly, I was surprised too.

00:27:48.900 --> 00:27:51.169
Seeing you surrounded
by your students afterwards

00:27:51.269 --> 00:27:53.104
made me so envious.

00:27:57.909 --> 00:27:59.778
I actually have a teaching license.

00:27:59.944 --> 00:28:00.945
Is that so?

00:28:01.212 --> 00:28:03.815
That day, I thought if there's
ever another chance after you

00:28:03.982 --> 00:28:05.316
I'd want to give it a try.

00:28:05.650 --> 00:28:07.919
You should.
I think you'd be a great fit.

00:28:08.119 --> 00:28:10.321
Really? That makes me happy.

00:28:11.322 --> 00:28:14.392
But first, focus on having
a successful surgery.

00:28:15.894 --> 00:28:16.895
Right.

00:28:47.058 --> 00:28:50.462
So, Prince Yamato Takeru
was you, wasn't it?

00:28:52.931 --> 00:28:54.265
Where's this coming from?

00:28:54.666 --> 00:28:56.935
You know Mr. Koshi, right?

00:28:58.103 --> 00:29:01.106
He said you took the donor list.

00:29:02.373 --> 00:29:04.142
Good job figuring that out.

00:29:07.912 --> 00:29:13.218
The Kusanagi sword came from
the tail of the Yamata-no-Orochi.

00:29:13.651 --> 00:29:17.989
And the large snake is said to
have come from Koshi's land

00:29:18.089 --> 00:29:20.592
which is around present-day Niigata.

00:29:21.326 --> 00:29:25.563
So, I thought perhaps
it's connected to the corruption.

00:29:28.666 --> 00:29:30.735
But I'm not Yamato Takeru.

00:29:32.303 --> 00:29:34.672
Still, I do have something
I want to say about the corruption.

00:29:34.939 --> 00:29:36.641
– What?
– Come with me.

00:29:41.713 --> 00:29:45.250
I'm sorry, Koreeda. I'm really sorry.

00:29:46.284 --> 00:29:48.119
What is this about?

00:29:49.254 --> 00:29:52.123
It started when
a student came to talk to me.

00:29:52.757 --> 00:29:55.093
She thought she might've
gotten in through unfair means.

00:29:55.760 --> 00:29:58.797
Her self-assessed scores
weren't high enough, she said.

00:30:00.031 --> 00:30:03.234
Then why is Mr. Mikami involved?

00:30:07.272 --> 00:30:08.573
Mikami Kota.

00:30:10.141 --> 00:30:15.246
his older brother was
my boyfriend back in high school.

00:30:16.748 --> 00:30:17.749
What?

00:30:18.650 --> 00:30:22.620
I heard the Ministry
was going to send a teacher

00:30:23.087 --> 00:30:24.355
through that dispatch program,
so I asked him for a favor.

00:30:25.156 --> 00:30:28.293
So it was you, Ms. Isshiki?

00:30:28.359 --> 00:30:30.228
You're Yamato Takeru?

00:30:30.328 --> 00:30:32.130
No, it's not me.

00:30:33.998 --> 00:30:38.336
If you know this much,
why not go public right now?

00:30:39.103 --> 00:30:41.039
There is no conclusive evidence that

00:30:41.139 --> 00:30:44.576
Nagatacho and Kasumigaseki gave
Rintoku favorable subsidies

00:30:44.676 --> 00:30:46.444
in exchange for favorable admissions.

00:30:46.978 --> 00:30:48.947
What about Mr. Koshi's records?

00:30:49.380 --> 00:30:52.016
It's a record of donations from
local chamber of commerce members.

00:30:52.517 --> 00:30:55.320
The amount was quite large,
but it was all above board.

00:30:57.322 --> 00:30:59.591
So, it's not proof.

00:30:59.824 --> 00:31:00.825
Right.

00:31:03.761 --> 00:31:04.963
It's unforgivable.

00:31:06.764 --> 00:31:09.100
Saying all the right things

00:31:09.167 --> 00:31:11.636
while making money off
children's lives...

00:31:12.704 --> 00:31:15.406
Taking advantage of
my mother's goodwill like that...

00:31:17.008 --> 00:31:18.076
Exactly.

00:31:20.612 --> 00:31:23.448
Isn't there anything I can do now?

00:31:25.450 --> 00:31:27.418
This concerns my students.

00:31:31.289 --> 00:31:32.290
I understand.

00:31:32.857 --> 00:31:34.826
There's something
I'd like your help with.

00:31:34.926 --> 00:31:35.927
What is it?

00:31:37.295 --> 00:31:38.796
It's Plan Okami Two.

00:31:46.537 --> 00:31:48.006
"Kanzaki, you once told me..."

00:31:50.074 --> 00:31:53.544
Is your goal revenge
against your father?

00:31:54.979 --> 00:31:55.980
What?

00:31:56.114 --> 00:31:58.416
I exposed Ms. Saejima's scandal

00:31:58.683 --> 00:32:01.052
to get back at my journalist father.

00:32:03.121 --> 00:32:05.490
"What I was thinking at that time...

00:32:06.858 --> 00:32:07.859
It was...

00:32:08.693 --> 00:32:14.866
envy at you for being able to
hate your father like that.

00:32:17.168 --> 00:32:19.737
There are parents in this world

00:32:19.837 --> 00:32:22.040
you don't even want to
feel anything toward.

00:32:26.044 --> 00:32:31.449
I came to be dominated
by a single phrase.

00:32:33.551 --> 00:32:35.987
It was a quote from
a certain revolutionary.

00:32:39.991 --> 00:32:45.730
'If the world changes you,
then you can change the world.'

00:32:49.334 --> 00:32:50.568
I wanted to change.

00:32:53.471 --> 00:32:54.472
I...

00:32:58.076 --> 00:33:00.044
I so desperately wanted to change."

00:33:06.084 --> 00:33:07.085
Kanzaki!

00:33:11.022 --> 00:33:13.057
Wanna come to my place today?

00:33:13.624 --> 00:33:15.393
I found something about that case.

00:33:21.966 --> 00:33:23.101
Hey, Lupin.

00:33:23.167 --> 00:33:25.636
Pull up the 2019 class roster.

00:33:25.737 --> 00:33:26.738
Sure thing.

00:33:28.106 --> 00:33:30.308
Usually, when there's
an issue with a student

00:33:30.408 --> 00:33:34.112
the school has them stay home
until disciplinary action is taken.

00:33:34.278 --> 00:33:35.613
Shiiba was like that, right?

00:33:35.713 --> 00:33:40.184
So I filtered out students whose
absences weren't clearly explained.

00:33:41.185 --> 00:33:42.420
Over the past ten years

00:33:42.520 --> 00:33:47.058
there's only one student in
Ms. Saejima class who matched...

00:33:47.325 --> 00:33:48.326
And boom!

00:33:48.760 --> 00:33:51.596
Hey, Lupin. Show me Tokura's data.

00:33:51.696 --> 00:33:52.997
Opening now.

00:33:56.701 --> 00:33:58.603
He was absent
for a week after finals.

00:33:58.703 --> 00:34:01.806
He wasn't disciplined for anything,
but it's curious, right?

00:34:03.741 --> 00:34:05.510
Send this address to my phone.

00:34:06.110 --> 00:34:07.111
Wait, are you going there?

00:34:07.578 --> 00:34:09.347
I want to talk to him
as soon as possible.

00:34:09.947 --> 00:34:11.616
What is this about?

00:34:12.250 --> 00:34:14.485
We're now nearing the climax!

00:34:36.674 --> 00:34:39.010
Bringing Mikami back and
promoting him to department head?

00:34:39.277 --> 00:34:42.180
No one's going to accept
such a ridiculous personnel move.

00:34:42.413 --> 00:34:45.283
You were gunning for
that position, right, Makino?

00:34:45.817 --> 00:34:47.018
Of course.

00:34:48.953 --> 00:34:50.955
If Mikami beats me to it
after everything I've done

00:34:51.055 --> 00:34:52.457
I'll become a laughingstock.

00:34:54.525 --> 00:34:59.697
If I'm being honest,
I'm not about to let this slide.

00:35:29.627 --> 00:35:33.965
Are you from Rintoku?

00:35:37.368 --> 00:35:38.836
You're Tokura Itsuki, right?

00:35:44.609 --> 00:35:45.743
My name's Kanzaki.

00:35:47.011 --> 00:35:49.647
Could I talk to you for a moment?

00:36:02.193 --> 00:36:04.729
– "Verbose."
– It means "mawarikudoi."

00:36:04.829 --> 00:36:06.764
– Oh, correct!
– Nice!

00:36:07.632 --> 00:36:11.135
Okay, next...
"To squander something."

00:36:11.235 --> 00:36:12.236
You're not joining us, Tominaga?

00:36:12.336 --> 00:36:13.638
Sorry, something's come up.
See you!

00:36:13.738 --> 00:36:14.906
See you tomorrow.

00:36:45.636 --> 00:36:47.171
It's Plan Okami Two.

00:37:02.220 --> 00:37:05.489
Mr. Mizohata, do you have a moment?

00:37:09.193 --> 00:37:11.529
If possible, I'd like to
speak with you in private.

00:37:17.969 --> 00:37:20.171
– Come in.
– Excuse me.

00:37:22.807 --> 00:37:24.742
My, this is unusual.

00:37:25.142 --> 00:37:26.143
Please, have a seat.

00:37:26.244 --> 00:37:27.245
Thanks.

00:37:28.512 --> 00:37:30.514
During my stay here for the
past six months in Rintoku

00:37:30.748 --> 00:37:34.118
I've been moved by
your remarkable educational vision.

00:37:35.286 --> 00:37:38.155
The school's philosophy is
deeply ingrained in every student

00:37:38.256 --> 00:37:40.091
and I find myself amazed every day.

00:37:42.526 --> 00:37:46.597
I'm surprised to hear
that you feel that way.

00:38:02.346 --> 00:38:07.084
When I first joined this school,
it was you who mentored me.

00:38:09.353 --> 00:38:12.990
You stayed close to the students
and respected their independence.

00:38:13.090 --> 00:38:15.226
Expand your horizons,
but don't forget your roots.

00:38:15.326 --> 00:38:20.798
You taught me the essence of
what education should be.

00:38:25.636 --> 00:38:27.672
But lately

00:38:29.206 --> 00:38:32.009
it seems like you've
forgotten those ideals.

00:38:35.746 --> 00:38:39.417
Though, to me...

00:38:41.819 --> 00:38:44.655
it looks like you're
carrying a heavy burden.

00:38:49.827 --> 00:38:51.729
I have no idea what you mean.

00:39:10.414 --> 00:39:11.515
Murder Suspect Mayama Yuzuru
Is Saejima's Daughter

00:39:14.618 --> 00:39:16.287
What about this?

00:39:18.356 --> 00:39:20.257
I'll get right to the point.

00:39:20.324 --> 00:39:22.326
We found out who sent this.

00:39:27.732 --> 00:39:29.266
The person who sent this...

00:39:36.707 --> 00:39:38.342
It was you, wasn't it, Mr. Mizohata?

00:39:43.180 --> 00:39:45.916
It's well known that
Nagatacho and Kasumigaseki

00:39:46.016 --> 00:39:48.552
still use fax machines
to send sensitive documents.

00:39:49.420 --> 00:39:52.256
But there's something
we bureaucrats are taught first.

00:39:53.891 --> 00:39:56.260
Never send multiple faxes
from the same convenience store.

00:39:57.194 --> 00:39:59.430
Especially not from one
near your home.

00:40:00.831 --> 00:40:01.832
The reason being...

00:40:02.867 --> 00:40:06.303
Because the store number
is printed right here.

00:40:09.006 --> 00:40:10.441
And this number

00:40:10.508 --> 00:40:13.677
matches the convenience store
nearest to Mr. Mizohata's home.

00:40:24.989 --> 00:40:29.593
Is that really enough to
count as evidence?

00:40:29.760 --> 00:40:31.695
I went to that store and asked.

00:40:37.435 --> 00:40:40.171
They confirmed that this man
was the one who sent it.

00:40:43.407 --> 00:40:45.209
Why would he do such a thing?

00:40:48.679 --> 00:40:52.850
From my end, I have no intention
of making this public.

00:40:54.218 --> 00:40:55.219
But...

00:40:57.021 --> 00:40:58.189
But what?

00:41:00.458 --> 00:41:05.796
Mr. Mizohata, I'd like you to
tell me everything you know.

00:41:09.066 --> 00:41:10.434
I don't know what
you're talking about.

00:41:11.001 --> 00:41:12.903
This school is
engaged in illicit behavior.

00:41:19.610 --> 00:41:26.517
And all the dirty work has
long been pushed onto you.

00:41:29.987 --> 00:41:36.160
You've endured so much
this whole time, haven't you?

00:41:44.168 --> 00:41:45.703
What would someone like you...

00:41:46.971 --> 00:41:49.139
someone who was raised
in comfort, possibly understand?

00:41:49.240 --> 00:41:50.307
I do understand!

00:41:53.844 --> 00:41:55.613
I was finally entrusted with
being a homeroom teacher

00:41:56.680 --> 00:41:58.349
and then I was replaced.

00:42:01.252 --> 00:42:08.192
No amount of money
can fix that frustration.

00:42:14.431 --> 00:42:15.432
But...

00:42:17.635 --> 00:42:19.670
There's no turning back for me.

00:42:22.439 --> 00:42:23.440
Maybe you can't turn back.

00:42:27.011 --> 00:42:31.582
But you can move forward.

00:42:39.290 --> 00:42:42.026
If you leave it to me

00:42:42.493 --> 00:42:44.595
I believe I can persuade Mr. Mizohata
to stand down quietly.

00:42:49.466 --> 00:42:51.368
What's your goal?

00:42:52.336 --> 00:42:54.838
To achieve true educational reform.

00:42:56.807 --> 00:43:00.511
You and I share
the same educational ideals.

00:43:00.945 --> 00:43:02.146
Let's join forces

00:43:02.212 --> 00:43:05.082
and turn Rintoku
into the top school in Japan.

00:43:39.183 --> 00:43:43.921
The Neverending Story

00:43:57.134 --> 00:43:58.202
Ms. Saejima.

00:44:00.004 --> 00:44:01.138
It's been a while.

00:44:03.607 --> 00:44:04.608
Why are you here?

00:44:05.676 --> 00:44:06.977
Ms. Saejima.

00:44:08.312 --> 00:44:09.313
You were protecting him.

00:44:10.114 --> 00:44:11.782
You were protecting
Tokura, weren't you?

00:44:25.362 --> 00:44:26.563
Okami!

00:44:29.033 --> 00:44:31.435
– What happened?
– It's Tominaga...

00:44:32.136 --> 00:44:33.504
Is something wrong with Tominaga?

00:44:33.604 --> 00:44:35.139
I just got a call.

00:44:36.707 --> 00:44:37.908
Hello?

00:44:43.313 --> 00:44:44.381
Help me.

00:44:47.184 --> 00:44:48.185
What?

00:44:49.520 --> 00:44:50.587
Where are you right now?

00:44:54.158 --> 00:44:55.559
Okami would know.

00:45:01.331 --> 00:45:02.700
Do you have any idea
where she might be?

00:45:09.006 --> 00:45:10.007
Let's go.

00:45:11.208 --> 00:45:13.444
We can finally expose the full scope
of Rintoku's corruption.

00:45:13.544 --> 00:45:15.446
Saying it might have been
an illegitimate admission...

00:45:15.546 --> 00:45:17.748
Isn't this decisive evidence?

00:45:19.683 --> 00:45:20.751
Yamato Takeru Appears

00:45:20.851 --> 00:45:23.053
So you're choosing Mikami.

00:45:23.153 --> 00:45:27.458
Anyone without a vision for education
needs to step aside.

00:45:27.558 --> 00:45:29.593
Deceiving the enemy
starts with deceiving your own side.

00:45:29.693 --> 00:45:31.261
Are you okay
just leaving it like this?

00:45:31.361 --> 00:45:32.663
By protecting me

00:45:32.763 --> 00:45:34.298
she ended up
doing something terrible.

00:45:34.398 --> 00:45:36.133
So a deal really was made, wasn't it?

00:45:36.700 --> 00:45:40.003
And the real reason you left the
school wasn't because of an affair.

00:45:40.804 --> 00:45:42.172
They need to act now.

00:45:42.239 --> 00:45:43.907
He is trying to win me over.
