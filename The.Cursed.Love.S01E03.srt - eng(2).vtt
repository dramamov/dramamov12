I'm here to find Tambralinga.

00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:56.640
If you want to stay here,

00:01:56.680 --> 00:01:59.520
don't let Khun hear about finding Tambralinga!

00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:07.400
Whoa.

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:09.091
- Take off your pants, too.
- What?!

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:09.960
Hey!

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:10.880
Calm down!

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:11.920
What are you embarrassed about?

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:14.048
Hey!

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:18.960
Why are you in my room?

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:21.440
Give me back my necklace!

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:22.360
No!

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:28.837
I need to find Tambralinga!

00:02:28.877 --> 00:02:29.817
Let go of me!

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:30.949
No!

00:02:31.131 --> 00:02:32.331
Give me back my necklace!

00:02:32.677 --> 00:02:33.466
Let me go...

00:02:33.902 --> 00:02:35.342
I'm losing control of myself!!

00:02:36.171 --> 00:02:38.491
Let go!!

00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:00.320
Put that fire out!

00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:02.080
I don't know how!

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:03.520
I can't...

00:03:14.860 --> 00:03:16.040
You need to put it out right now!

00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:17.840
I can't do it.

00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:04.680
Come on, get up.

00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:52.240
Khunkhao,

00:04:52.680 --> 00:04:54.240
if you're not gonna give me the necklace,

00:04:54.760 --> 00:04:56.200
can you at least take me to the city?

00:04:57.100 --> 00:04:58.280
You need to get it together

00:04:59.080 --> 00:05:00.000
and tell me

00:05:00.140 --> 00:05:02.800
how your power to control fire
concerns Tambralinga.

00:05:07.600 --> 00:05:08.360
Well,

00:05:08.560 --> 00:05:10.400
three years ago,
on the night of my birthday...

00:05:26.560 --> 00:05:27.440
Bastards.

00:05:32.820 --> 00:05:34.040
What the hell are you doing?!

00:05:39.900 --> 00:05:42.320
Nothing to do with a parasite like you.

00:05:42.800 --> 00:05:43.900
Don't stick that d*mn nose in.

00:05:44.280 --> 00:05:45.720
You betray my father.

00:05:46.780 --> 00:05:48.440
I won't let you get away with that!

00:05:48.680 --> 00:05:50.880
And what are you gonna do, huh?

00:05:51.260 --> 00:05:52.560
Go crying to your daddy.

00:05:52.680 --> 00:05:53.780
Go!

00:05:53.980 --> 00:05:55.320
I'm not afraid of him!

00:06:16.900 --> 00:06:17.620
F*ck!

00:06:21.840 --> 00:06:22.840
What the hell is that?!

00:06:35.360 --> 00:06:36.240
Siwat!

00:06:36.280 --> 00:06:37.000
Don't...

00:06:37.560 --> 00:06:38.280
Let go!

00:06:38.400 --> 00:06:39.160
Get off me...

00:06:39.200 --> 00:06:40.040
Let go!!

00:06:40.860 --> 00:06:41.680
What's going on here?

00:06:42.040 --> 00:06:43.000
- Tell me!
- Father!

00:06:43.040 --> 00:06:43.920
What happened?

00:06:43.960 --> 00:06:44.680
Father...

00:06:45.200 --> 00:06:47.806
Aisoon and Maria are having an affair!

00:07:07.200 --> 00:07:08.320
You knew?

00:07:13.920 --> 00:07:16.240
Then, why are they still in your life?

00:07:17.720 --> 00:07:18.880
I keep quiet...

00:07:19.440 --> 00:07:21.160
because I don't want it to be a scandal

00:07:21.440 --> 00:07:22.840
and affect our brand.

00:07:23.640 --> 00:07:25.240
Wow...

00:07:25.480 --> 00:07:27.880
So protective of your image.

00:07:28.274 --> 00:07:32.280
What if I leak
some private photos between him and me

00:07:32.600 --> 00:07:35.360
to f*ck everything up?

00:07:35.580 --> 00:07:37.960
Because if a wife like me
doesn't have a say in management,

00:07:38.300 --> 00:07:40.920
then neither can an adopted bastard like him!

00:07:42.240 --> 00:07:43.200
Get off me!!!

00:07:44.320 --> 00:07:45.920
You're a monster!

00:07:46.880 --> 00:07:48.258
A monster!

00:07:52.240 --> 00:07:54.520
That was the first time
I discovered my power.

00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:57.040
From then on, every time my heart races,

00:07:57.540 --> 00:08:01.000
fire ignites on the flammable stuff around me.

00:08:01.440 --> 00:08:03.520
It gets so bad
that I don't want to be around people.

00:08:06.880 --> 00:08:08.320
I'm not making things up!

00:08:15.360 --> 00:08:16.600
[The Origin of Siva's Cosmic Dance]

00:08:19.540 --> 00:08:20.280
Father?

00:08:21.040 --> 00:08:21.960
Come here, son.

00:08:24.620 --> 00:08:25.520
I think...

00:08:25.820 --> 00:08:28.200
I found a way to lift your fire curse.

00:08:29.840 --> 00:08:30.640
Look,

00:08:31.200 --> 00:08:32.600
it's a picture of Shiva Nataraja.

00:08:33.400 --> 00:08:35.640
The right hand holds up the Damaru,

00:08:36.240 --> 00:08:37.720
symbolizing the creation of Earth,

00:08:38.300 --> 00:08:40.280
while the left carries destructive Agni.

00:08:40.760 --> 00:08:42.312
And the inner edge you're seeing...

00:08:42.440 --> 00:08:43.440
is water.

00:08:43.920 --> 00:08:46.760
And what does that have to do with my curse?

00:08:47.580 --> 00:08:50.240
Look at the blazing Agni symbol
on the Lord's hand.

00:08:50.880 --> 00:08:51.980
What do you think it resembles?

00:08:53.920 --> 00:08:56.320
It looks like a symbol
that appears on my wrist

00:08:56.360 --> 00:08:58.240
when I can't control myself.

00:08:58.900 --> 00:08:59.960
Look,

00:09:00.240 --> 00:09:01.600
here lies Pallava scripts,

00:09:02.160 --> 00:09:04.560
dated back to 11 B.E.

00:09:04.980 --> 00:09:07.448
which was coeval
with the copper-soiled land.

00:09:09.920 --> 00:09:11.760
If we can get there,

00:09:13.280 --> 00:09:15.640
we might just find the way to break your curse.

00:09:16.240 --> 00:09:19.840
Does this mean...
I can be freed from this?

00:09:20.540 --> 00:09:22.560
And you will no longer suffer,

00:09:23.680 --> 00:09:25.000
as long as we find...

00:09:26.040 --> 00:09:27.920
Tambralinga,

00:09:27.960 --> 00:09:30.440
a city hidden in the Khao Luang forest.

00:09:32.680 --> 00:09:34.600
But the forest is immensely large.

00:09:34.760 --> 00:09:36.160
How could we find its location?

00:09:37.040 --> 00:09:40.080
The only few people
who have witnessed the ruins of Tambralinga

00:09:40.420 --> 00:09:44.200
belongs to the family of Hunter Singkhon.

00:09:44.880 --> 00:09:46.160
"Hunter Singkhon"?

00:09:52.980 --> 00:09:54.280
Until one day, I dreamed of you.

00:09:55.920 --> 00:09:57.760
After three years of seeing you in my dream,

00:09:58.080 --> 00:10:01.120
I realized you're the one
who can take me to Tambralinga.

00:10:01.642 --> 00:10:04.720
Your Shiva lingam necklace
and my Yoni stone necklace

00:10:05.200 --> 00:10:07.280
were created to worship Siva.

00:10:08.540 --> 00:10:10.120
They attract each other.

00:10:12.700 --> 00:10:13.520
So what?

00:10:14.646 --> 00:10:16.747
You existed in the past

00:10:17.387 --> 00:10:18.434
with the name 'Asuni.'

00:10:20.320 --> 00:10:23.240
My family has witnessed
neither the ruins nor the clues,

00:10:23.680 --> 00:10:26.040
and my father was sacrificed to that city

00:10:26.240 --> 00:10:27.400
by the hands
of that godd*mned Michael!

00:10:27.440 --> 00:10:29.960
I don't believe my father killed him!

00:10:31.240 --> 00:10:32.640
Father said he was a friend

00:10:32.840 --> 00:10:35.000
and the most skilled hunter in Phrom Khiri.

00:10:35.980 --> 00:10:37.033
That bastard killed my dad.

00:10:37.073 --> 00:10:38.140
Any proof?

00:10:38.360 --> 00:10:40.560
That day, my dad followed him to Khao Luang.

00:10:40.740 --> 00:10:42.600
Did you see
with your own eyes that he hurt him?

00:10:44.040 --> 00:10:44.920
Sure you didn't.

00:10:45.560 --> 00:10:47.080
Without any single evidence,

00:10:47.600 --> 00:10:50.200
you should not accuse anyone of being a murderer.

00:10:50.960 --> 00:10:52.880
It doesn't matter if you believe me

00:10:53.600 --> 00:10:55.120
because my dad

00:10:55.760 --> 00:10:56.760
and that f*cking...

00:11:01.440 --> 00:11:02.320
your father

00:11:02.880 --> 00:11:04.600
had to die because of that godd*mned city.

00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:08.320
I won't let anyone
sacrifice their life to it again.

00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:10.800
I just wanna know why I dreamed of it

00:11:10.840 --> 00:11:12.400
and why we both have powers!

00:11:12.660 --> 00:11:15.200
It's because you were brainwashed
into believing in that city!

00:11:15.460 --> 00:11:17.320
Then, why did that archaic man in my dream

00:11:17.360 --> 00:11:19.840
have the same symbol
that appeared on your forehead?

00:11:21.120 --> 00:11:22.720
You saw it.

00:11:23.040 --> 00:11:24.240
I didn't.

00:11:24.500 --> 00:11:25.720
But I really did see it!

00:11:27.200 --> 00:11:28.080
Khunkhao,

00:11:28.320 --> 00:11:29.440
our abilities,

00:11:29.720 --> 00:11:31.880
your wind control and my fire control,

00:11:32.200 --> 00:11:34.120
are not enough to prove
we existed in the past?

00:11:35.620 --> 00:11:36.920
What would you argue

00:11:37.920 --> 00:11:39.120
with those we have?

00:11:40.080 --> 00:11:41.400
Miracle?

00:11:41.700 --> 00:11:43.400
Spell? Sorcery?

00:11:43.720 --> 00:11:44.760
What else?

00:11:46.037 --> 00:11:46.837
Hey,

00:11:47.380 --> 00:11:48.360
listen carefully.

00:11:48.700 --> 00:11:50.360
Even if what happened between us was true

00:11:50.720 --> 00:11:53.320
or that Tambralinga city is truly in Khao Luang,

00:11:54.080 --> 00:11:55.880
I'll bury that city with my own hands

00:11:55.920 --> 00:11:59.040
so that it doesn't cause any chaos to my forest!

00:12:01.140 --> 00:12:03.720
But it's the only way I can break the curse!

00:12:03.840 --> 00:12:05.200
That's your business,

00:12:05.420 --> 00:12:06.720
not mine!

00:12:07.180 --> 00:12:09.680
Don't even think about
projecting your problems onto others.

00:12:10.420 --> 00:12:11.760
Do you even realize

00:12:11.800 --> 00:12:13.440
how much of a burden you're becoming?

00:12:16.600 --> 00:12:19.320
Just give up on finding Tambralinga!

00:12:52.080 --> 00:12:52.913
The hell are you looking at?

00:12:52.953 --> 00:12:53.979
You told me to look at your face.

00:12:54.080 --> 00:12:54.960
- A**hole.
- A**hole!

00:12:55.600 --> 00:12:58.160
I'm learning about Tambralinga.

00:12:58.780 --> 00:13:00.840
I will introduce you to Professor Thakoon.

00:13:01.988 --> 00:13:06.808
♫There's only you there inside my heart♫

00:13:06.848 --> 00:13:11.548
♫My love for you never evanesces♫

00:13:12.708 --> 00:13:13.808
Lookwaii,

00:13:14.208 --> 00:13:17.508
Our resort's reservations
have soured from two days ago!

00:13:22.408 --> 00:13:23.808
At this rate,

00:13:24.548 --> 00:13:27.548
I think our resort is gonna be a big hit.

00:13:29.268 --> 00:13:30.668
Confirm the reservations!

00:13:36.448 --> 00:13:37.748
Papi,

00:13:38.748 --> 00:13:39.708
I'm hungry.

00:13:40.868 --> 00:13:42.388
Alright.

00:13:58.668 --> 00:13:59.388
Here,

00:13:59.808 --> 00:14:01.068
this has less sugar.

00:14:01.968 --> 00:14:03.228
Thank you!

00:14:14.208 --> 00:14:15.508
Papi!

00:14:50.108 --> 00:14:53.348
Your Shiva lingam necklace
and my Yoni stone necklace

00:14:53.688 --> 00:14:55.908
were created to worship Siva.

00:14:56.988 --> 00:14:58.828
They attract each other.

00:14:59.388 --> 00:15:02.548
I realized you're the one
who can take me to Tambralinga.

00:15:04.828 --> 00:15:05.928
Here's your hot cocoa.

00:15:08.988 --> 00:15:09.988
Thank you.

00:15:12.048 --> 00:15:13.268
What are you thinking?

00:15:15.148 --> 00:15:16.428
It's Siwat, isn't it?

00:15:19.088 --> 00:15:20.628
If you're uncomfortable that he's here...

00:15:20.668 --> 00:15:21.668
I'm not.

00:15:23.148 --> 00:15:24.588
That was in the heat of the moment.

00:15:25.748 --> 00:15:27.068
I was furious at Michael,

00:15:27.588 --> 00:15:28.948
so I took it out on him.

00:15:30.628 --> 00:15:31.908
But I don't hate him.

00:15:33.268 --> 00:15:34.798
Then, what's the problem?

00:15:37.888 --> 00:15:39.308
I just...

00:15:42.948 --> 00:15:44.268
I just need some time.

00:15:44.828 --> 00:15:46.508
Siwat just lost his father,

00:15:46.888 --> 00:15:48.048
even though that man was...

00:15:51.428 --> 00:15:52.588
Don't worry, Auntie.

00:15:53.028 --> 00:15:54.708
I won't ever take it out on him again.

00:15:56.948 --> 00:15:59.823
I'm glad that you came to understand him.

00:16:03.708 --> 00:16:04.548
Aunt Kate,

00:16:06.868 --> 00:16:10.628
do you believe in the two stone necklaces
that would open Tambralinga's gate?

00:16:13.148 --> 00:16:16.559
Quartz Shiva lingam and Yoni stone necklaces

00:16:17.068 --> 00:16:18.908
are believed to be the gate openers.

00:16:21.068 --> 00:16:22.308
Aunt Kate!

00:16:22.788 --> 00:16:23.748
Aunt Kate!

00:16:23.968 --> 00:16:25.748
What's going on? Watch your step!

00:16:25.788 --> 00:16:27.200
You can trip with that running!

00:16:27.328 --> 00:16:28.528
Next week,

00:16:28.688 --> 00:16:31.988
our rooms are sold out!

00:16:32.908 --> 00:16:35.588
The reviews Lookwaii shared
on social platforms are working!

00:16:35.908 --> 00:16:36.868
They are!

00:16:39.708 --> 00:16:42.708
Now that KhunKhao Homestay is opening,

00:16:43.188 --> 00:16:45.188
it has to be awe-inspiring.

00:17:06.508 --> 00:17:07.548
- There!
- Ow!

00:17:07.588 --> 00:17:09.108
Why here? I'm gonna be all wet!

00:17:09.148 --> 00:17:10.668
Oh, did we get you, Cuppycake?

00:17:10.708 --> 00:17:12.255
- Mind, take this.
- "Cuppycake," my butt!

00:17:15.268 --> 00:17:16.428
Right here, Aunt Kate.

00:17:18.388 --> 00:17:19.868
- Go.
- Aha.

00:17:19.908 --> 00:17:21.148
What's with the silly walk?

00:17:21.188 --> 00:17:22.468
For God's sake, stop yapping!

00:17:22.508 --> 00:17:23.548
When are you gonna get it done

00:17:23.588 --> 00:17:25.648
with all that arguing, young man!

00:17:26.148 --> 00:17:28.508
- Goodness!
- Right here

00:17:29.187 --> 00:17:30.307
Lookwaii!

00:17:32.668 --> 00:17:33.428
Oh,

00:17:33.468 --> 00:17:34.988
- let me help you with that.
- Can you see if this is okay?

00:17:35.028 --> 00:17:36.148
Alright, alright.

00:17:36.188 --> 00:17:36.988
This is pretty good.

00:17:37.028 --> 00:17:39.108
Why don't we use a dryer?

00:17:39.148 --> 00:17:40.148
It's probably better.

00:17:40.388 --> 00:17:41.228
Do you want me to buy one?

00:17:41.268 --> 00:17:42.948
Oh, it's alright, dear.

00:17:43.188 --> 00:17:46.268
I saw how sunny it was today,

00:17:46.308 --> 00:17:48.228
so I thought I might dry these sheets in the sun

00:17:48.268 --> 00:17:51.188
so you can smell that nice, sun-dried scent!

00:17:52.228 --> 00:17:53.748
Alright, allow me to help you.

00:17:53.788 --> 00:17:54.948
Okay, dear.

00:17:55.203 --> 00:17:56.628
- Okay.
- Easy with the compliments.

00:17:56.668 --> 00:17:57.806
- Okay!
- Aunt Kate.

00:17:58.228 --> 00:18:00.508
- Auntie Lek, please take your time.
- Alright, thank you.

00:18:07.708 --> 00:18:08.548
- Huh?
- That's good.

00:18:08.588 --> 00:18:09.908
That's awesome.

00:18:09.948 --> 00:18:13.068
Why are everyone so excited
about welcoming the tourists?

00:18:13.688 --> 00:18:17.068
It's the first time in years
that the homestay is back in operation!

00:18:17.108 --> 00:18:18.508
After Uncle Singkhon passed...

00:18:24.188 --> 00:18:25.108
You can talk about it.

00:18:26.308 --> 00:18:27.548
I also want to know

00:18:27.908 --> 00:18:29.588
how everyone here has been

00:18:29.628 --> 00:18:30.923
after his passing.

00:18:31.668 --> 00:18:32.468
Well,

00:18:33.308 --> 00:18:35.428
the homestay had to shut down.

00:18:36.308 --> 00:18:39.268
We live off the income

00:18:39.308 --> 00:18:41.388
from Uncle Klai's
cocoa bean sales to the factory.

00:18:41.548 --> 00:18:42.868
Yes, that's right.

00:18:43.748 --> 00:18:44.868
Along with...

00:18:45.441 --> 00:18:46.788
some earnings from tourism navigation

00:18:46.828 --> 00:18:49.668
that Kor, Pun, and Thara do.

00:18:51.068 --> 00:18:52.128
That works.

00:18:52.828 --> 00:18:53.848
See you in town.

00:18:55.868 --> 00:18:57.388
This one.

00:18:57.548 --> 00:18:58.428
Get me.

00:18:59.068 --> 00:19:00.228
- Aunt Kate,
- Yes?

00:19:00.388 --> 00:19:01.788
I'm visiting the town;

00:19:02.068 --> 00:19:03.388
I have a meeting with a friend.

00:19:07.948 --> 00:19:09.708
Here are some hot cocoas!

00:19:09.748 --> 00:19:11.588
Let them have some first.

00:19:11.888 --> 00:19:13.080
Be careful.

00:19:17.308 --> 00:19:18.629
- Cuppycake!
- Geez!

00:19:18.669 --> 00:19:20.508
Do you want me to see which ones are good

00:19:20.548 --> 00:19:21.788
and pick the bad ones out?

00:19:21.828 --> 00:19:24.268
You can help me by seeing yourself out

00:19:24.788 --> 00:19:27.828
- and let me work in peace!
- We can't help you with that!

00:19:28.868 --> 00:19:29.748
Aw, Cuppycake!

00:19:30.048 --> 00:19:31.268
Picking on me much?

00:19:37.268 --> 00:19:38.028
Hey!

00:19:38.248 --> 00:19:39.028
You!

00:19:40.948 --> 00:19:41.708
What?

00:19:45.588 --> 00:19:46.828
Can you take me to the hospital?

00:19:47.348 --> 00:19:48.468
Wait for Thara.

00:19:48.908 --> 00:19:50.508
Kor and Lookwaii won't take too long.

00:19:51.748 --> 00:19:52.948
What a heartless guy!

00:19:57.468 --> 00:19:59.428
Well, other people seem to be busy.

00:19:59.868 --> 00:20:01.028
Can't you just take me?

00:20:03.068 --> 00:20:03.948
Get in the car.

00:20:05.048 --> 00:20:06.188
And next time,

00:20:06.228 --> 00:20:07.548
before you want to call someone heartless,

00:20:08.228 --> 00:20:09.288
take a look at their face.

00:20:33.108 --> 00:20:34.108
The hell are you looking at?

00:20:34.828 --> 00:20:36.148
You told me to look at your face.

00:20:37.228 --> 00:20:38.388
I'm looking.

00:20:40.948 --> 00:20:42.108
- A**hole.
- A**hole!

00:21:07.588 --> 00:21:11.708
[Old City Wall, Nakhon Si Thammarat]

00:21:19.148 --> 00:21:20.148
Hey,

00:21:21.148 --> 00:21:22.148
give me your phone.

00:21:35.148 --> 00:21:36.108
This is my Line contact.

00:21:37.108 --> 00:21:38.388
Stroll around this area,

00:21:38.588 --> 00:21:39.748
and I'll call you when I'm done.

00:21:40.868 --> 00:21:41.708
Okay.

00:23:17.468 --> 00:23:18.428
Excuse me,

00:23:18.868 --> 00:23:20.028
is something wrong?

00:23:21.668 --> 00:23:23.508
You seem to be into history.

00:23:26.828 --> 00:23:27.828
Yes,

00:23:28.408 --> 00:23:30.348
this is actually my first time here.

00:23:31.188 --> 00:23:32.288
I'm Earth.

00:23:33.968 --> 00:23:35.588
I graduated from Archeology

00:23:36.068 --> 00:23:38.188
and now work at the Tambralinga Museum

00:23:38.508 --> 00:23:39.868
which is not very far from here.

00:23:40.868 --> 00:23:42.188
If you're interested...

00:23:43.148 --> 00:23:44.508
I'm Siwat,

00:23:45.048 --> 00:23:46.228
and yes, I am.

00:23:46.668 --> 00:23:49.952
I'm learning about Tambralinga.

00:23:52.308 --> 00:23:53.708
Then, you're in the right place.

00:23:54.388 --> 00:23:56.508
I'll introduce you to Professor Thakoon.

00:24:06.668 --> 00:24:09.708
Fate will bring the Yoni stone
and the Shiva lingam quartz together.

00:24:09.748 --> 00:24:11.828
Soon, the Four Element Benders will appear.

00:24:11.868 --> 00:24:13.908
And once the gate to Tambralinga opens again,

00:24:13.948 --> 00:24:16.669
we will use these two stones
to awaken Kalakal's atman.

00:24:16.976 --> 00:24:21.816
♫There's only you there inside my heart♫

00:24:21.856 --> 00:24:24.296
♫My love for you never evanesces♫

00:24:35.776 --> 00:24:36.816
I'm a curator

00:24:36.856 --> 00:24:39.096
for my history professor's personal museum.

00:24:43.496 --> 00:24:46.942
Do you have any insights on Tambralinga?

00:24:47.496 --> 00:24:49.616
Tambralinga was an ancient empire,

00:24:50.256 --> 00:24:52.816
existing even before 7 B.E.

00:24:53.956 --> 00:24:55.216
This is Professor Thakoon,

00:24:55.556 --> 00:24:56.896
the owner of the museum.

00:24:58.016 --> 00:24:58.736
Right,

00:24:59.096 --> 00:25:00.056
hello.

00:25:13.336 --> 00:25:16.416
The professor gathers information
on Tambralinga for publishing.

00:25:17.136 --> 00:25:20.176
Every Sunday, a seminar is held

00:25:20.216 --> 00:25:21.662
for academic purposes

00:25:22.029 --> 00:25:23.669
and to tell all kinds of tales.

00:25:35.296 --> 00:25:37.976
This is...Shiva Nataraja,

00:25:41.456 --> 00:25:44.016
the highest deity of the cosmic dancers.

00:26:01.856 --> 00:26:03.576
These symbols,

00:26:03.616 --> 00:26:05.496
do they have any meaning?

00:26:10.696 --> 00:26:13.216
That's a symbol
of Brahmin Suriya's family lineage,

00:26:15.116 --> 00:26:17.376
the leader of all the fire benders,

00:26:17.696 --> 00:26:19.616
and one of the four rulers of the city.

00:26:23.336 --> 00:26:25.896
So who were the leaders
of the other three families?

00:26:28.220 --> 00:26:31.856
Brahmin Asuni, the Air bender,

00:26:33.236 --> 00:26:35.296
Brahmin Apo, the Water bender,

00:26:36.596 --> 00:26:40.056
and Brahmin Kalakal, the Earth bender.

00:26:43.016 --> 00:26:45.096
These were the four rulers of the city

00:26:45.136 --> 00:26:47.216
the people who brought equilibrium to Tambralinga.

00:26:48.576 --> 00:26:49.856
There was a memo about it...

00:26:50.876 --> 00:26:52.056
It was true...

00:26:55.456 --> 00:26:58.576
And why has no one
ever been able to locate Tambralinga?

00:27:03.336 --> 00:27:04.336
Read the memo.

00:27:07.336 --> 00:27:10.536
A palm-leaf inscription
written in Pallava scripts

00:27:10.576 --> 00:27:13.336
concerning the four elements.

00:27:13.636 --> 00:27:17.376
It was believed
that once the Four Benders

00:27:17.676 --> 00:27:20.496
come to a reconvocation,

00:27:20.816 --> 00:27:24.976
Tambralinga's reappearance
might become a reality.

00:27:39.496 --> 00:27:41.176
I'll send you off here, then.

00:27:42.536 --> 00:27:43.296
Sure.

00:27:44.056 --> 00:27:45.616
If you want any more insights,

00:27:45.736 --> 00:27:46.820
I will be forwarding them.

00:27:47.776 --> 00:27:49.336
Anyway, thank you so much for today.

00:27:49.376 --> 00:27:50.136
Of course.

00:27:56.616 --> 00:27:57.616
Hey, Khunkhao.

00:27:59.716 --> 00:28:03.136
Just...wandering around Wat Phra Mahathat.

00:28:05.336 --> 00:28:06.536
I'm going back there now.

00:28:10.976 --> 00:28:12.096
Khunkhao?

00:28:13.256 --> 00:28:15.496
Is he the owner of Khunkhao Homestay?

00:28:16.356 --> 00:28:17.216
He is.

00:28:17.776 --> 00:28:19.056
Do you know him?

00:28:19.762 --> 00:28:20.896
He's a friend of mine.

00:28:21.056 --> 00:28:22.176
Oh...

00:28:22.776 --> 00:28:24.536
But don't tell him

00:28:24.576 --> 00:28:26.376
that I took you to Professor Thakoon;

00:28:27.876 --> 00:28:29.136
otherwise...

00:28:30.056 --> 00:28:31.256
he's gonna go rampant.

00:28:32.496 --> 00:28:33.496
Why would he?

00:28:35.056 --> 00:28:38.616
He's afraid Thakoon will guide people
to treasure hunting in Tambralinga

00:28:39.416 --> 00:28:41.056
and destroy the forest.

00:28:42.196 --> 00:28:43.816
It's such nonsense, though.

00:28:46.496 --> 00:28:47.656
Please, excuse me.

00:29:09.616 --> 00:29:10.319
Hey!
[Old City Wall, Nakhon Si Thammarat]

00:29:12.776 --> 00:29:13.616
Here you go.

00:29:15.976 --> 00:29:16.856
Thanks.

00:29:18.576 --> 00:29:20.096
I have to make two more stops.

00:29:20.536 --> 00:29:21.336
To where?

00:29:22.096 --> 00:29:22.856
Skip the questions

00:29:22.896 --> 00:29:23.773
and just get in the car.

00:29:43.436 --> 00:29:44.336
Hey, Dad.

00:29:45.016 --> 00:29:46.976
Yeah, I'm still tracking him.

00:29:47.836 --> 00:29:49.376
Yeah, don't worry!

00:29:49.916 --> 00:29:51.296
I won't let him out of my sight.

00:29:51.736 --> 00:29:52.736
'Kay.

00:29:59.856 --> 00:30:01.536
After a lifetime of searching for the Yoni stone,

00:30:02.456 --> 00:30:04.336
it suddenly presented itself to us.

00:30:04.976 --> 00:30:06.616
Luck is truly on our side, Professor.

00:30:08.636 --> 00:30:09.856
This is not luck,

00:30:11.216 --> 00:30:12.656
it's fate.

00:30:16.896 --> 00:30:19.616
An emphasis on this memo's authenticity.

00:30:21.776 --> 00:30:26.376
Why didn't you say
that Khunkhao's Shiva lingam and the Yoni stone

00:30:27.056 --> 00:30:30.216
can lead us to the city gate?

00:30:35.656 --> 00:30:37.856
It seems like they're still suspicious of us,

00:30:46.616 --> 00:30:50.376
but fate brings the Yoni stone
and the Shiva lingam quartz together.

00:30:51.136 --> 00:30:53.736
Soon, the Four Element Benders will appear.

00:30:55.656 --> 00:30:58.016
And once the gate to
Tambralinga opens again,

00:30:59.216 --> 00:31:02.256
no one will ever deem me a mad scholar again.

00:31:28.656 --> 00:31:29.656
Hey!

00:31:30.736 --> 00:31:32.176
Where's my "thank you"?

00:31:32.896 --> 00:31:33.776
Thanks.

00:31:38.896 --> 00:31:39.776
Mr. Siwat?

00:31:42.296 --> 00:31:43.896
Has Khun already taken you to the hospital?

00:31:44.856 --> 00:31:45.856
Don't you have eyes?

00:31:46.736 --> 00:31:47.736
Nosy jerk.

00:31:48.536 --> 00:31:50.016
Uh, he has.

00:31:50.736 --> 00:31:53.416
I saw him about to take off,

00:31:53.456 --> 00:31:55.216
so I asked to tag along.

00:31:56.076 --> 00:31:57.496
Is there something wrong?

00:31:58.236 --> 00:31:59.236
No,

00:31:59.856 --> 00:32:01.216
I didn't see you around,

00:32:01.256 --> 00:32:02.256
so I became worried.

00:32:03.616 --> 00:32:04.816
No need to.

00:32:05.616 --> 00:32:06.856
Having me around

00:32:07.376 --> 00:32:08.736
is the safest.

00:32:22.376 --> 00:32:23.376
Have you eaten?

00:32:23.756 --> 00:32:25.176
I'll tell Mom to make something.

00:32:25.656 --> 00:32:26.776
Thank you,

00:32:27.656 --> 00:32:28.976
but please don't trouble yourself.

00:32:29.456 --> 00:32:30.736
I don't want to bother you.

00:32:53.056 --> 00:32:55.696
That's a symbol
of Brahmin Suriya's family lineage,

00:32:56.376 --> 00:32:58.536
the leader of all the fire benders,

00:32:58.976 --> 00:33:00.936
and one of the four rulers of the city.

00:33:01.776 --> 00:33:05.376
Brahmin Asuni, the Air bender,

00:33:06.696 --> 00:33:08.936
Brahmin Apo, the Water bender,

00:33:10.376 --> 00:33:13.376
and Brahmin Kalakal, the Earth bender.

00:33:14.316 --> 00:33:16.296
These were the four rulers of the city,

00:33:16.336 --> 00:33:18.456
the people who brought
equilibrium to Tambralinga.

00:33:22.776 --> 00:33:25.896
The only few people
who have witnessed the ruins of Tambralinga

00:33:26.196 --> 00:33:29.896
belongs to the family of Hunter Singkhon.

00:33:52.076 --> 00:33:53.955
This was the start of the research

00:33:53.995 --> 00:33:56.376
that led me to search for Tambralinga.

00:34:09.015 --> 00:34:11.541
♫Om, legend has told♫

00:34:11.575 --> 00:34:14.392

00:34:14.416 --> 00:34:17.674
♫Wandering through Khao Luang♫

00:34:17.698 --> 00:34:21.448
♫He ravaged his path♫

00:34:21.473 --> 00:34:27.071
♫To a stone pillar♫

00:34:28.049 --> 00:34:30.941
♫Slumbering over the altar,♫

00:34:30.965 --> 00:34:34.914
♫He laid above the realm,♫

♫The base of Shiva lingam, he claimed♫

00:34:45.656 --> 00:34:47.866
I found the lyrics to this ballad ten years ago,

00:34:48.516 --> 00:34:52.256
and I wholeheartedly believe
the city's hidden in Khao Luang,

00:34:52.616 --> 00:34:55.456
somewhere invisible to naked eyes
unless Siva paves the way.

00:34:55.496 --> 00:34:57.016
[Tambralinga]

00:35:02.696 --> 00:35:04.736
Earth took you to Thakoon, didn't he?

00:35:05.736 --> 00:35:06.576
Huh?

00:35:07.916 --> 00:35:09.776
He was just sharing something
I never knew about.

00:35:10.396 --> 00:35:12.736
I demand that you
not have any further contact with Thakoon

00:35:12.776 --> 00:35:14.456
and to stop finding that city!

00:35:16.616 --> 00:35:18.656
What's with you and Professor Thakoon?

00:35:19.096 --> 00:35:21.136
If you can't follow my orders,

00:35:21.776 --> 00:35:22.776
then, just get lost!

00:35:28.736 --> 00:35:29.936
You again?

00:35:40.876 --> 00:35:42.296
I told you I was fine.

00:35:42.976 --> 00:35:44.176
Don't stress it.

00:35:46.556 --> 00:35:47.776
Thank you,

00:35:48.116 --> 00:35:50.176
but I don't really eat desserts.

00:36:06.136 --> 00:36:10.496
Why does the lost city
have something to do with my power,

00:36:10.536 --> 00:36:14.296
and why does the man I dreamed of
look like you?

00:36:16.371 --> 00:36:23.164
♫Keep my love safe and sound 'til that day♫

00:36:40.224 --> 00:36:43.964
I wholeheartedly believe
the city's hidden in Khao Luang.

00:36:48.844 --> 00:36:50.084
Mr. Siwat!

00:36:51.664 --> 00:36:53.164
Do you like this?

00:37:11.284 --> 00:37:13.884
Why do you want to find that city?

00:37:15.364 --> 00:37:17.524
I just want to fulfill my father's dream,

00:37:19.044 --> 00:37:21.024
but no one's ever...

00:37:21.064 --> 00:37:23.564
answered my questions like Professor Thakoon does.

00:37:24.444 --> 00:37:25.644
Thakoon...

00:37:26.444 --> 00:37:29.044
is called a heretic of a scholar.

00:37:29.084 --> 00:37:30.724
He's good at storytelling

00:37:31.284 --> 00:37:33.084
and convincing people.

00:37:33.724 --> 00:37:36.404
He's the kind
that doesn't care what it takes to win,

00:37:36.564 --> 00:37:38.484
not even when he used Uncle Singkhon.

00:37:42.124 --> 00:37:44.884
Two years ago, before his passing,

00:37:45.724 --> 00:37:48.964
he discovered the ruins
of the city up in Khao Luang.

00:37:50.044 --> 00:37:51.724
Thakoon found this out,

00:37:52.064 --> 00:37:54.564
so he asked Uncle Singkhon to take him there

00:37:54.884 --> 00:37:56.404
with a promise

00:37:57.164 --> 00:37:59.764
that he wouldn't ever take this to the media.

00:38:00.404 --> 00:38:01.684
Can you guess what happened?

00:38:02.804 --> 00:38:05.924
Thakoon held a press conference,
claiming that he was the explorer,

00:38:06.884 --> 00:38:09.684
telling them he'd take them to prove it.

00:38:10.524 --> 00:38:12.884
But I've been keeping up with this for so long,

00:38:13.044 --> 00:38:16.564
yet I've never heard any news
about discovering the ruins.

00:38:17.224 --> 00:38:19.324
Because Thakoon
never got to lay eyes on those again.

00:38:21.164 --> 00:38:23.284
Uncle Singkhon performed a ritual
to conceal the forest.

00:38:23.324 --> 00:38:25.764
since the very day he took Thakoon's team back.

00:38:26.804 --> 00:38:28.684
After he died,

00:38:29.004 --> 00:38:31.684
Thakoon repeatedly
pestered Khunkhao to take him there again,

00:38:32.324 --> 00:38:34.324
but Khunkhao always denied him.

00:38:36.284 --> 00:38:38.421
Do you also believe

00:38:38.884 --> 00:38:41.124
that someone will die
if the city is being searched for?

00:38:43.804 --> 00:38:46.564
My mom told me
that was what Uncle Singkhon believed.

00:38:47.384 --> 00:38:49.804
Considering his death,

00:38:49.844 --> 00:38:51.844
it is the evidence that it might be true.

00:38:58.084 --> 00:38:59.964
Do you have any lifelong questions

00:39:00.844 --> 00:39:02.204
that haven't been answered?

00:39:07.044 --> 00:39:08.044
I do.

00:39:40.804 --> 00:39:42.284
Don't you think about searching for one?

00:39:43.307 --> 00:39:46.844
If the answer I'm looking for
doesn't cause anyone trouble,

00:39:47.844 --> 00:39:49.284
then I won't give up on it.

00:39:50.164 --> 00:39:54.028
But if it puts people around me in danger,

00:39:55.204 --> 00:39:56.298
I will stop,

00:39:56.824 --> 00:39:57.924
never bringing it up again.

00:40:07.084 --> 00:40:08.484
Knowing this,

00:40:09.704 --> 00:40:11.324
you still want to continue?

00:40:42.284 --> 00:40:45.084
Should I stop searching for the city
like Khunkhao said?

00:41:01.644 --> 00:41:04.284
The ruins that the professor found
with Uncle Singkhon

00:41:04.744 --> 00:41:07.244
have photos he's never revealed before.

00:41:29.844 --> 00:41:32.044
Tambralinga was an ancient empire,

00:41:33.024 --> 00:41:35.724
existing even before 7 B.E.

00:42:02.244 --> 00:42:03.244
Wait, Mr. Siwat?

00:42:05.044 --> 00:42:06.244
Where are you going?

00:42:13.164 --> 00:42:14.044
Aunt Kate!

00:42:14.084 --> 00:42:14.964
Aunt Kate!

00:42:15.004 --> 00:42:16.084
We have a problem!

00:42:17.924 --> 00:42:19.244
- Uncle Klai,
- Yes?

00:42:19.364 --> 00:42:22.404
please remind the workers
not to neglect the cocoa bean's quality.

00:42:22.964 --> 00:42:24.844
Don't let the sale drop
like it did last year.

00:42:24.884 --> 00:42:25.884
Yes, ma'am.

00:42:26.284 --> 00:42:27.724
Look, see these?

00:42:28.404 --> 00:42:31.204
Oh, I guess
they haven't taken a good look at them.

00:42:31.244 --> 00:42:32.764
- Maybe, they're fake?
- That's right.

00:42:32.804 --> 00:42:34.924
- There's a lot here.
- They didn't do a great job,

00:42:34.964 --> 00:42:36.644
- so...
- Siwat's food is here!

00:42:36.684 --> 00:42:40.119
Oh, I didn't make it spicy just for him!

00:42:41.344 --> 00:42:43.284
- Take it to him.
- Sure, ma'am!

00:42:43.324 --> 00:42:44.324
Wait,

00:42:44.804 --> 00:42:45.924
let me take care of it.

00:42:46.904 --> 00:42:48.211
Oh, alright.

00:42:48.604 --> 00:42:49.702
We have a problem, Aunt Kate!

00:42:49.804 --> 00:42:51.564
- Aunt Kate, we have a problem!
- What is it?

00:42:51.924 --> 00:42:53.004
Siwat is gone.

00:42:53.044 --> 00:42:53.964
- Huh?!
- What?

00:42:54.284 --> 00:42:55.044
Gone where?

00:42:55.404 --> 00:42:56.284
I don't know,

00:42:56.404 --> 00:42:57.484
but I saw him driving off.

00:42:59.124 --> 00:43:00.164
- Hey!
- What?

00:43:00.204 --> 00:43:01.004
- What?
- Eh?

00:43:01.804 --> 00:43:02.804
Cuppycake...

00:43:03.244 --> 00:43:04.764
I'll cuppycake you in the face!

00:43:04.804 --> 00:43:07.284
Goodness, we're in trouble here!

00:43:25.484 --> 00:43:26.284
Hey!

00:43:29.764 --> 00:43:31.364
Do you have a death wish or something?

00:43:32.204 --> 00:43:33.204
Go home.

00:43:37.364 --> 00:43:39.044
Professor Thakoon has photos of the ruins

00:43:39.084 --> 00:43:40.444
from when Uncle Singkhon took him.

00:43:40.704 --> 00:43:41.924
I want to see things with my own eyes.

00:43:42.804 --> 00:43:43.804
And what next?!

00:43:44.244 --> 00:43:45.724
Even though you know where it is,

00:43:45.764 --> 00:43:47.764
as long as I don't give you
this Shiva lingam necklace,

00:43:48.124 --> 00:43:50.084
you won't ever find that city, will you?

00:43:51.124 --> 00:43:52.364
So why are you even going?

00:43:54.804 --> 00:43:55.604
Wait,

00:43:57.524 --> 00:43:58.284
what?

00:44:00.044 --> 00:44:02.444
So that my fire ability can't hurt anyone,

00:44:04.044 --> 00:44:05.044
including you.

00:44:08.164 --> 00:44:09.364
Now, if you'd let me go.

00:44:11.604 --> 00:44:13.164
Roaming into the forest isn't simple.

00:44:13.524 --> 00:44:16.604
You would never
get to the ruins to save your life.

00:44:17.964 --> 00:44:19.044
You've seen them?

00:44:23.324 --> 00:44:25.524
So the ruins Professor Thakoon said were real?

00:44:26.684 --> 00:44:28.044
They are just some ruins,

00:44:28.084 --> 00:44:29.324
no city exists there anymore.

00:44:29.564 --> 00:44:31.364
That's because you were there without me!

00:44:31.604 --> 00:44:33.964
You didn't see anything
because you didn't have my necklace.

00:44:35.164 --> 00:44:37.204
Do you really think
there are some kinds of miracles,

00:44:37.244 --> 00:44:39.684
magically revealing the gate
only because of these two stones?

00:44:40.324 --> 00:44:41.604
This is a reality,

00:44:41.644 --> 00:44:43.524
not your imaginary world!

00:44:44.344 --> 00:44:45.804
- Just trust me...
- But I won't,

00:44:46.284 --> 00:44:47.942
until I witness everything first-hand

00:44:47.982 --> 00:44:50.244
that all those tales,
legends, or whatever I've known of

00:44:50.284 --> 00:44:51.444
don't exist!

00:45:41.204 --> 00:45:42.804
What it takes you to stop

00:45:42.844 --> 00:45:44.004
is to take you there?

00:45:45.924 --> 00:45:46.844
Yes,

00:45:49.764 --> 00:45:52.084
and even though
I don't have your Shiva lingam necklace,

00:45:52.964 --> 00:45:55.924
I won't just abandon my lifelong curiosity.

00:45:56.764 --> 00:46:01.106
Why does the lost city
have something to do with my power,

00:46:02.324 --> 00:46:06.524
and why does the man
I dreamed of look like you?

00:46:08.604 --> 00:46:10.044
Those answers are hidden there.

00:46:12.364 --> 00:46:19.444
♫Every time the old's replaced with a new one♫

00:46:19.484 --> 00:46:26.424
♫Nothing's the same forever, it's all changed♫

00:46:26.464 --> 00:46:29.884
♫But there's one thing still remains♫

00:46:29.924 --> 00:46:34.004
♫That's my only one true love♫

00:46:34.044 --> 00:46:35.844
♫Through hundred thousand years♫

00:46:35.884 --> 00:46:41.124
♫It's still only you, not anyone else♫

00:46:41.484 --> 00:46:48.484
♫Keep my love safe and sound 'til that day♫

00:46:48.524 --> 00:46:54.324
♫I'll be there to be by your side, your side only♫

00:46:54.724 --> 00:46:58.164
♫Please hear my plead♫

00:46:58.204 --> 00:47:02.724
♫No matter how long it takes♫

00:47:02.884 --> 00:47:04.484
Why does it hurt so much?

00:47:06.244 --> 00:47:13.646
♫This heart's forever loyal, no difference♫

00:47:14.164 --> 00:47:17.724
♫It keeps beating for you forevermore♫

00:47:17.764 --> 00:47:21.204
♫Never want to change, alright♫

00:47:21.244 --> 00:47:26.084
♫There's only you there inside my heart♫

♫My love for you never evanesces♫

00:47:34.524 --> 00:47:35.884
Ever since the day I met you,

00:47:35.924 --> 00:47:38.404
I've felt like we connected
in some kind of way.

00:47:38.444 --> 00:47:40.964
It's almost like...
I’ve met you before.

00:47:41.004 --> 00:47:44.044
The three of us were the Benders
from the legend of Tambralinga.

00:47:44.084 --> 00:47:46.044
We are bound by the past.

00:47:46.084 --> 00:47:47.044
I don't wanna hear that.

00:47:47.084 --> 00:47:48.324
But I do.

00:47:49.084 --> 00:47:51.884
We will bathe the Shiva lingam quartz
and the Yoni stone in moonlight

00:47:51.924 --> 00:47:53.524
to worship Siva,

00:47:53.564 --> 00:47:55.204
for the Lord will open up the way to the city.

00:47:55.244 --> 00:47:57.244
Om...

00:48:03.564 --> 00:48:08.084
♫No matter how long it takes♫

00:48:08.124 --> 00:48:11.564
♫I'll still choose to love you♫

00:48:11.604 --> 00:48:18.764
♫This heart's forever loyal, no difference♫

00:48:18.884 --> 00:48:22.444
♫It keeps beating for you forevermore♫

00:48:22.484 --> 00:48:25.924
♫Never want to change, alright♫

00:48:25.964 --> 00:48:30.724
♫There's only you there inside my heart♫

00:48:30.764 --> 00:48:36.125
♫My love for you never evanesces♫
