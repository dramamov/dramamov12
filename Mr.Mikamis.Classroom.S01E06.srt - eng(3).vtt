WEBVTT

00:00:04.437 --> 00:00:06.006
Takashi,
something awful has happened!

00:00:07.007 --> 00:00:08.074
Your brother, he...

00:00:15.115 --> 00:00:16.583
My friend told me...

00:00:17.751 --> 00:00:21.121
"Your brother's
been acting strange lately."

00:00:31.264 --> 00:00:34.801
I feel bad that you have to
go through this because of me.

00:00:45.478 --> 00:00:47.113
Kota! Kota!

00:00:48.014 --> 00:00:49.015
Don't look.

00:01:04.064 --> 00:01:06.032
Takashi, don't look!

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:36.863
MR. MIKAMI'S CLASSROOM

00:01:38.798 --> 00:01:39.799
I...

00:01:44.204 --> 00:01:45.371
I'm okay now.

00:01:48.842 --> 00:01:50.310
So next...

00:01:51.211 --> 00:01:52.312
It's your turn.

00:02:15.502 --> 00:02:19.172
Light Fit Sanitary Napkins

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:34.220
The Shocking Past of
the Bureaucrat-Turned-Teacher

00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:36.389
Involved in a Revolving Door Scandal

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:46.399
Emotions become unstable
during menstruation

00:02:46.499 --> 00:02:48.601
so it's not unusual for
various things to happen.

00:02:49.235 --> 00:02:52.839
But you can buy
sanitary products at the school store

00:02:53.039 --> 00:02:55.441
and there are some stocked
in the restrooms too.

00:02:55.642 --> 00:02:58.111
Still, I was concerned because
she keeps coming here

00:02:58.211 --> 00:02:59.412
to ask for them lately.

00:02:59.979 --> 00:03:01.881
I'm heading to
the staff room for a moment.

00:03:01.981 --> 00:03:04.384
If anyone comes, could you
tell them I'll be right back?

00:03:35.114 --> 00:03:37.617
Could it be that
she couldn't afford them?

00:03:38.151 --> 00:03:40.320
I think that's a real possibility.

00:03:47.961 --> 00:03:50.897
You're frozen like a statue.
Are you okay?

00:03:51.197 --> 00:03:54.334
Sorry, I grew up with a brother...

00:03:54.534 --> 00:03:57.270
As a teacher, you can't avoid
dealing with these issues.

00:03:57.370 --> 00:04:01.641
But, are those things
really that expensive?

00:04:02.342 --> 00:04:04.310
At most, about 500 yen?

00:04:05.712 --> 00:04:08.147
Period poverty...

00:04:08.715 --> 00:04:10.416
That's what I was thinking.

00:04:12.252 --> 00:04:13.553
How is Shiiba's home situation?

00:04:14.520 --> 00:04:17.156
She lost her parents in
a car accident when she was little.

00:04:17.557 --> 00:04:19.726
She's currently being raised by
her paternal grandparents

00:04:19.826 --> 00:04:21.394
who run a traditional sweets shop.

00:04:21.761 --> 00:04:23.363
It wouldn't be surprising

00:04:23.429 --> 00:04:26.366
if her home environment
has changed drastically.

00:04:26.899 --> 00:04:27.934
That was careless of me.

00:04:28.234 --> 00:04:29.802
I'll arrange a meeting
with her right away.

00:04:31.871 --> 00:04:33.840
– Come in.
– Excuse me.

00:04:35.942 --> 00:04:39.312
– So this is where you were.
– Is something wrong?

00:04:43.016 --> 00:04:44.851
What is this about?

00:04:50.356 --> 00:04:52.225
– Isn't this bad?
– What?

00:04:54.827 --> 00:04:56.763
– Wait, what?
– What is this?

00:04:56.863 --> 00:04:58.464
– What is this?
– I don't know.

00:04:58.564 --> 00:04:59.565
The Shocking Past of
the Bureaucrat-Turned-Teacher

00:04:59.666 --> 00:05:00.700
His Brother Committed Suicide at
Keiryo Academy 22 Years Ago!

00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:01.834
Is this for real?

00:05:03.102 --> 00:05:04.137
I have no idea.

00:05:06.172 --> 00:05:07.573
Okami...

00:05:11.177 --> 00:05:13.012
That was over 20 years ago.

00:05:15.948 --> 00:05:17.717
But, for them to write about it...

00:05:17.850 --> 00:05:20.320
That kind of gossip article
isn't worth taking seriously.

00:05:23.489 --> 00:05:24.957
Can we start class?

00:05:40.073 --> 00:05:41.974
How can you stay so calm
when something like that

00:05:42.075 --> 00:05:43.209
is written about you?

00:05:43.576 --> 00:05:45.011
This doesn't concern you.

00:05:46.979 --> 00:05:48.414
I can't forgive this.

00:05:52.051 --> 00:05:53.052
Because...

00:05:54.520 --> 00:05:55.621
it does concern us.

00:05:59.192 --> 00:06:02.962
Okay, let's pick up from
where we left off yesterday.

00:06:04.030 --> 00:06:05.498
Page 181.

00:06:28.788 --> 00:06:31.090
Do you think it's true?

00:06:32.325 --> 00:06:34.093
What is it with bureaucrats?

00:06:34.961 --> 00:06:37.497
The spotlight only shines on us
at times like this.

00:06:38.598 --> 00:06:39.766
That's so true.

00:06:40.266 --> 00:06:42.168
You can really feel
the public's desire

00:06:42.235 --> 00:06:44.837
to see powerful people fall.

00:06:44.937 --> 00:06:48.074
It's a job that gets criticized
but never praised.

00:06:48.174 --> 00:06:49.609
That's what being a bureaucrat is.

00:06:50.009 --> 00:06:51.644
No wonder
fewer people want to do it.

00:06:52.812 --> 00:06:55.648
Our curriculum guidelines
are based on "The Zest for Life."

00:06:56.149 --> 00:06:59.485
But, teacher turnover and
student suicides are both increasing.

00:07:00.553 --> 00:07:04.690
That key phrase has
become some sort of dark humor.

00:07:06.225 --> 00:07:08.494
It's no wonder
we're being criticized.

00:07:12.698 --> 00:07:14.100
Are you feeling okay?

00:07:18.237 --> 00:07:23.576
Why is a male teacher
asking me about menstruation?

00:07:28.080 --> 00:07:32.919
Even with my female friends,
it's hard to talk about that stuff.

00:07:32.985 --> 00:07:34.287
Do you understand that?

00:07:34.387 --> 00:07:36.122
Well, I guess.

00:07:40.193 --> 00:07:42.462
You're the very one
who hides everything about yourself.

00:07:45.031 --> 00:07:46.032
What?

00:07:46.332 --> 00:07:50.002
Telling others to open up
when you won't is violence.

00:08:01.881 --> 00:08:02.882
That hurt...

00:08:05.084 --> 00:08:06.285
Let's have a showdown.

00:08:16.629 --> 00:08:19.765
Tazune was crying
the whole time during class.

00:08:20.800 --> 00:08:21.834
Did you notice?

00:08:22.668 --> 00:08:23.970
Is that why you called me out?

00:08:24.136 --> 00:08:25.137
Yeah.

00:08:25.204 --> 00:08:27.640
Brace yourself, because you're going
to get an earful.

00:08:30.943 --> 00:08:32.445
Do you know why she was crying?

00:08:35.948 --> 00:08:37.283
Come on!

00:08:45.525 --> 00:08:46.692
You're really good.

00:08:50.563 --> 00:08:51.564
Think.

00:08:52.698 --> 00:08:55.201
Think with your own head.

00:08:55.635 --> 00:08:56.736
Well, this is sudden.

00:08:57.136 --> 00:08:59.171
That's fine. You're not wrong.

00:09:01.741 --> 00:09:02.842
What's the problem?

00:09:04.076 --> 00:09:07.013
If it's between teacher and student,
this is the perfect answer.

00:09:08.281 --> 00:09:11.083
But, what about between two people?

00:09:13.753 --> 00:09:15.321
We're completely bare.

00:09:16.756 --> 00:09:18.057
If we're dressed in layers...

00:09:18.124 --> 00:09:20.760
we won't be able to answer
the tough questions you throw at us.

00:09:21.160 --> 00:09:24.096
Everyone's fighting unarmed,
completely exposed.

00:09:25.431 --> 00:09:26.699
Do you realize that?

00:09:30.036 --> 00:09:31.237
So...

00:09:32.271 --> 00:09:36.609
Why are you the only one
wearing a suit of armor?

00:09:42.348 --> 00:09:43.683
Well said.

00:09:47.853 --> 00:09:49.589
I'm just built different up here.

00:09:51.123 --> 00:09:52.658
Everyone knows.

00:09:53.926 --> 00:09:55.394
After reading that article

00:09:56.429 --> 00:09:59.031
we all know what you meant
when you told us to think.

00:10:00.366 --> 00:10:02.268
There isn't a single person
who doesn't get it.

00:10:04.070 --> 00:10:06.739
Yet you tell us
it has nothing to do with us.

00:10:07.039 --> 00:10:08.741
You're still
in your armor, acting cool.

00:10:08.808 --> 00:10:10.209
It makes no sense.

00:10:10.643 --> 00:10:12.211
Face it properly.

00:10:17.149 --> 00:10:19.819
Maybe it's you who still
can't think of it as something

00:10:21.621 --> 00:10:23.456
that happened 20 years ago.

00:10:34.533 --> 00:10:35.601
This is a problem.

00:10:35.701 --> 00:10:37.503
If something like this
happens again, Mr. Kodai will...

00:10:37.603 --> 00:10:38.704
Exactly.

00:10:38.804 --> 00:10:42.541
Just when the Mayama Yuzuru case
was finally dying down.

00:10:43.109 --> 00:10:45.645
What's the actual situation
with Mr. Kodai?

00:10:46.045 --> 00:10:47.346
Well, that's...

00:10:47.446 --> 00:10:50.650
Don't tell me he is
declining the matter concerning

00:10:50.750 --> 00:10:52.818
ex-Chief Cabinet Secretary Azuma's
grandchild?

00:10:52.918 --> 00:10:55.154
No way!

00:10:56.355 --> 00:10:59.558
Well, yes.
You are actually exactly right.

00:11:00.026 --> 00:11:02.128
He says, with the media
swarming around the school

00:11:02.228 --> 00:11:03.696
there's no way he can proceed.

00:11:03.863 --> 00:11:05.264
Well, that's a problem.

00:11:05.998 --> 00:11:08.701
Are you okay with
making Mr. Azuma angry?

00:11:08.801 --> 00:11:12.705
Next year's subsidy
could be in jeopardy.

00:11:13.105 --> 00:11:14.907
That's definitely a problem.

00:11:15.074 --> 00:11:16.242
Right?

00:11:16.842 --> 00:11:19.111
None of us three here
will benefit from this.

00:11:25.451 --> 00:11:28.087
Understood. I'll try to
convince him somehow.

00:11:29.455 --> 00:11:30.690
– Here.
– Right...

00:11:30.790 --> 00:11:31.891
Here you go.

00:11:53.045 --> 00:11:54.947
Dinosaurs...

00:11:55.414 --> 00:11:58.384
It's said that because their brains
were small for their body size...

00:11:58.651 --> 00:12:01.754
when they got their tail stepped on

00:12:03.556 --> 00:12:05.925
it took them about ten minutes
before they'd go, "Aaaah!"

00:12:09.662 --> 00:12:13.032
Isn't that just like Japan right now?

00:12:21.207 --> 00:12:22.942
But academic theory
has changed, you know.

00:12:25.044 --> 00:12:29.048
Turns out they could move
pretty fast, Kota.

00:12:42.728 --> 00:12:45.297
Leave the Kodai matter to me.

00:12:45.397 --> 00:12:47.266
That's reassuring.

00:12:47.366 --> 00:12:49.168
– Well then, shall we?
– Do you know a good place?

00:12:49.268 --> 00:12:51.337
Yes. Actually, I have
a place I'm close with...

00:12:53.305 --> 00:12:55.307
We sincerely apologize,
but we are temporarily closed.

00:12:55.407 --> 00:12:58.911
Shiinoha is closed for now.

00:12:59.311 --> 00:13:01.781
Do you know the reason?

00:13:02.715 --> 00:13:06.385
I heard the owner's dementia
has worsened.

00:13:06.485 --> 00:13:08.788
I see.

00:13:08.854 --> 00:13:10.222
What about his wife?

00:13:10.689 --> 00:13:12.858
Well, that's the thing...

00:13:13.425 --> 00:13:15.461
I think it was around the summer.

00:13:16.162 --> 00:13:17.963
She collapsed.

00:13:22.201 --> 00:13:24.537
General visiting, second floor.

00:13:24.670 --> 00:13:28.808
Number 77, please proceed
to the second-floor tower.

00:13:35.981 --> 00:13:37.783
I don't want to be written about.

00:13:39.285 --> 00:13:44.456
I kept pretending not to see.

00:13:47.693 --> 00:13:49.929
Both the inferiority complex
I had toward my father...

00:13:51.630 --> 00:13:54.700
And the baseless sense of
superiority I held toward others...

00:13:57.636 --> 00:14:00.573
Mr. Mikami saw right through that.

00:14:03.609 --> 00:14:04.610
Me...

00:14:08.681 --> 00:14:09.715
You too...

00:14:14.019 --> 00:14:15.387
We can't go back anymore.

00:14:19.992 --> 00:14:21.393
Are you really okay with this?

00:14:28.567 --> 00:14:32.605
It's already too late.

00:14:35.107 --> 00:14:36.208
Even if it is...

00:14:38.844 --> 00:14:40.112
Even if it's too late...

00:14:43.649 --> 00:14:44.717
I have to write it.

00:14:57.763 --> 00:15:04.536
Mikami Sonoko

00:15:16.782 --> 00:15:18.450
Long time no see.

00:15:23.889 --> 00:15:26.492
Kota, who is this?

00:15:27.226 --> 00:15:28.227
What?

00:15:28.427 --> 00:15:30.562
Sorry for calling you
to a place like this.

00:15:32.231 --> 00:15:33.232
It's okay.

00:15:34.333 --> 00:15:35.768
You come every weekend?

00:15:36.368 --> 00:15:37.503
As much as I can.

00:15:38.070 --> 00:15:40.039
Kota, who is she?

00:15:40.940 --> 00:15:43.609
Do you remember Isshiki Mayumi?

00:15:53.452 --> 00:15:54.453
I'm sorry.

00:15:57.890 --> 00:16:00.526
– Is it always like this?
– What do you mean?

00:16:00.626 --> 00:16:01.627
I mean...

00:16:03.562 --> 00:16:04.596
She called you Kota.

00:16:07.599 --> 00:16:09.001
Shall we talk over there?

00:16:13.672 --> 00:16:14.873
Are you okay?

00:16:15.574 --> 00:16:16.709
What do you mean?

00:16:18.077 --> 00:16:20.312
Does she sometimes
recognize you, Takashi?

00:16:23.515 --> 00:16:24.516
Not really.

00:16:25.718 --> 00:16:26.952
I see.

00:16:28.520 --> 00:16:29.688
I've gotten used to it.

00:16:31.790 --> 00:16:33.158
You shouldn't get used to it.

00:16:34.660 --> 00:16:35.794
I don't think so.

00:16:36.595 --> 00:16:37.730
But I have no choice.

00:16:37.963 --> 00:16:39.832
It's been like this
for over 20 years.

00:16:46.972 --> 00:16:49.842
Kota is awful, isn't he?

00:16:50.309 --> 00:16:52.011
What's the point of saying that now?

00:16:54.246 --> 00:16:56.715
I just visited Ms. Sonoko's room.

00:16:56.849 --> 00:16:58.417
It looked like a jungle, didn't it?

00:16:59.551 --> 00:17:02.087
Even though it's been 20 years
since he passed away

00:17:02.955 --> 00:17:07.493
he still dominates so many hearts
and even makes the news.

00:17:09.995 --> 00:17:13.098
I just want to tell him to
stop hogging all the attention.

00:17:13.298 --> 00:17:14.500
Don't say it like that.

00:17:15.367 --> 00:17:17.202
Isn't it the same for you too,
Mayumi?

00:17:19.805 --> 00:17:20.973
True.

00:17:24.877 --> 00:17:26.545
Kota, you aren't wrong.

00:17:28.981 --> 00:17:30.582
Don't just say things to comfort me.

00:17:40.626 --> 00:17:43.962
Still, you are amazing.

00:17:46.899 --> 00:17:48.634
The school is starting to stir.

00:17:50.202 --> 00:17:51.703
What are you talking about?

00:17:51.770 --> 00:17:53.639
You're the one
who stirred things up, Mayumi.

00:17:54.840 --> 00:17:56.442
Mikami Takashi?

00:18:03.115 --> 00:18:05.150
Even so, you've got a lot of guts.

00:18:05.250 --> 00:18:06.952
Standing in front of
the Ministry of Education

00:18:07.086 --> 00:18:10.189
you told me, "Come to our school
to expose the darkness!"

00:18:12.758 --> 00:18:14.893
I saw the students who were suffering

00:18:14.960 --> 00:18:17.429
and felt I couldn't just stand by.

00:18:20.399 --> 00:18:21.600
The Ministry of Education...

00:18:22.034 --> 00:18:24.203
Rintoku, and Nagatacho...

00:18:25.704 --> 00:18:27.739
There's definitely a connection.

00:18:28.707 --> 00:18:30.609
And yet we still can't
get any solid evidence.

00:18:32.711 --> 00:18:35.614
But we'll uncover
the full truth, no matter what.

00:18:45.891 --> 00:18:46.959
And you...

00:18:49.261 --> 00:18:50.262
What?

00:18:50.496 --> 00:18:52.498
You called me here.

00:18:52.598 --> 00:18:54.833
That must mean
you want to move forward, right?

00:19:18.257 --> 00:19:20.526
If you warm it up a bit,
it'll feel better.

00:19:20.959 --> 00:19:22.461
Thank you.

00:19:25.230 --> 00:19:27.366
– Come in.
– Excuse me.

00:19:29.635 --> 00:19:30.769
Chigira?

00:19:31.737 --> 00:19:33.605
I heard you weren't
feeling well again.

00:19:33.939 --> 00:19:36.775
Yeah, I'm okay.
Just menstrual cramps.

00:19:36.875 --> 00:19:38.677
But it's been going on
for a while now.

00:19:39.077 --> 00:19:40.078
Yeah.

00:19:41.613 --> 00:19:42.814
Sorry, Chigira...

00:19:43.448 --> 00:19:45.384
Could you put this on for me?

00:19:46.185 --> 00:19:47.953
Of course.

00:19:48.187 --> 00:19:49.188
Thank you.

00:19:51.990 --> 00:19:53.225
Where should I stick it?

00:19:54.560 --> 00:19:57.329
– Lower back, please.
– Lower back? Okay.

00:19:57.429 --> 00:19:58.430
Mikami Takashi: I will
talk to the students now

00:19:58.530 --> 00:20:00.632
– How about here?
– Yeah. Thanks.

00:20:23.388 --> 00:20:24.756
I want to talk about my brother.

00:20:28.660 --> 00:20:30.028
It was something I should've shared.

00:20:30.762 --> 00:20:32.064
But I didn't.

00:20:32.831 --> 00:20:34.066
I'd like to take a bit of your time.

00:20:49.314 --> 00:20:53.118
The cause of death was suicide as
an act of protest against the school.

00:20:54.553 --> 00:20:56.188
He was in the broadcasting club

00:20:56.255 --> 00:20:59.124
and made an announcement
protesting against the school.

00:20:59.958 --> 00:21:02.261
Then, he activated a device
he built himself...

00:21:04.563 --> 00:21:05.697
and died by electrocution.

00:21:10.235 --> 00:21:12.237
What do you think of his actions?

00:21:20.712 --> 00:21:22.881
– What was the reason?
– Reason?

00:21:24.049 --> 00:21:26.885
The article didn't mention
the content of the protest.

00:21:29.221 --> 00:21:30.289
Tsugimoto.

00:21:31.223 --> 00:21:32.991
You've been gathering
information, haven't you?

00:21:33.125 --> 00:21:34.126
You know, right?

00:21:52.711 --> 00:21:54.079
The protest was about...

00:22:03.889 --> 00:22:08.660
Upon the transition from
middle to high school,

00:22:09.394 --> 00:22:14.866
the school rejected a student
with developmental disabilities.

00:22:16.635 --> 00:22:18.236
There was no issue
with their test scores.

00:22:18.503 --> 00:22:19.538
It was most likely because

00:22:20.339 --> 00:22:22.274
the student was considered
difficult to handle.

00:22:22.674 --> 00:22:24.009
So they got rid of them.

00:22:25.744 --> 00:22:29.548
This is a serious human rights issue.

00:22:30.215 --> 00:22:34.186
It goes against our school's motto
of creating an equal society.

00:22:35.887 --> 00:22:39.725
Mikami Kota started a petition.

00:22:40.726 --> 00:22:42.494
But at the time, the term
"developmental disability"

00:22:42.561 --> 00:22:44.229
wasn't widely understood.

00:22:44.896 --> 00:22:46.965
He couldn't gain
the support of his classmates.

00:22:47.432 --> 00:22:49.634
He became invisible in his class.

00:22:51.002 --> 00:22:52.671
His mental health declined.

00:22:54.072 --> 00:22:55.073
And one day

00:22:55.874 --> 00:22:59.010
he took an extreme action
no one could have ever imagined.

00:22:59.945 --> 00:23:06.218
I protest against the school
that created this situation.

00:23:09.688 --> 00:23:11.523
I protest against
the cold indifference

00:23:14.659 --> 00:23:16.928
shown toward me after I spoke up.

00:23:20.132 --> 00:23:21.933
I protest against the society

00:23:23.835 --> 00:23:25.904
that created
this kind of environment.

00:23:31.977 --> 00:23:33.111
With my death...

00:23:36.381 --> 00:23:37.382
I...

00:23:45.757 --> 00:23:48.260
I will complete this protest!

00:24:13.552 --> 00:24:15.420
That's all I know.

00:24:15.821 --> 00:24:17.422
It's a patchwork of things
I found online.

00:24:17.522 --> 00:24:18.757
I don't even know if it's true.

00:24:19.991 --> 00:24:21.927
It's okay. It matches the facts.

00:24:42.113 --> 00:24:44.449
I'll say this first
because I feel responsible.

00:24:47.786 --> 00:24:49.721
I understand
the content of this protest.

00:24:50.021 --> 00:24:51.790
I don't think he was wrong.

00:24:53.058 --> 00:24:56.294
And I find it very sad that

00:24:56.394 --> 00:24:58.430
someone who could
think that deeply chose to die.

00:25:00.932 --> 00:25:02.901
We shouldn't dismiss this
as someone else's problem.

00:25:48.480 --> 00:25:49.614
Anything else?

00:25:53.351 --> 00:25:58.423
Did the school provide
emotional support to Kota?

00:25:58.590 --> 00:25:59.858
His homeroom teacher
was very involved

00:25:59.958 --> 00:26:01.860
and even came to
our house to talk with him.

00:26:01.960 --> 00:26:05.964
But he was unable to stop him.

00:26:06.565 --> 00:26:08.733
After the teacher came, my mother,
who was overly attached to my brother

00:26:08.800 --> 00:26:10.135
learned of the situation.

00:26:11.069 --> 00:26:12.704
She clung to my brother, crying.

00:26:13.538 --> 00:26:17.242
Stop this nonsense and
focus on your studies!

00:26:17.342 --> 00:26:19.377
Someone has to do it!

00:26:19.477 --> 00:26:21.546
You've done more than enough!

00:26:22.447 --> 00:26:27.619
You don't need to
sacrifice your life for those kids!

00:26:42.200 --> 00:26:43.668
Okami, what do you think?

00:26:47.806 --> 00:26:49.874
If you plan to
contain this within the lesson...

00:26:49.941 --> 00:26:51.209
I won't forgive you.

00:27:04.255 --> 00:27:08.760
Thanks to you, Mr. Mikami...

00:27:09.160 --> 00:27:11.062
I was able to
face the truth about my father.

00:27:14.099 --> 00:27:15.867
Though all I can do is lend an ear.

00:27:48.199 --> 00:27:49.934
My brother was everything to me.

00:27:51.636 --> 00:27:52.637
All of my values

00:27:55.440 --> 00:27:58.009
were shaped by him.

00:28:00.712 --> 00:28:01.813
No, they used to be.

00:28:04.349 --> 00:28:05.383
The books he read...

00:28:06.117 --> 00:28:08.153
The movies he watched,
the music he listened to...

00:28:08.553 --> 00:28:11.189
Even the way he viewed society...
I looked up to all of it.

00:28:13.458 --> 00:28:19.097
Since I was a kid,
I lived wanting to be like him.

00:28:24.903 --> 00:28:25.937
That is, until that day.

00:28:32.310 --> 00:28:35.714
The role model in my life
suddenly disappeared.

00:28:37.782 --> 00:28:40.919
My mother broke down,
and our home collapsed.

00:28:44.456 --> 00:28:46.324
After his funeral,
I returned to school.

00:28:46.424 --> 00:28:48.059
But there was no place for me there.

00:28:49.728 --> 00:28:53.431
I couldn't take it
and applied to another high school.

00:28:56.167 --> 00:28:57.368
I ran away.

00:28:59.604 --> 00:29:04.075
Still, I didn't shut myself in.
I managed to keep living.

00:29:05.577 --> 00:29:07.278
Maybe I'm just naturally numb.

00:29:11.916 --> 00:29:13.818
Even that became
a source of inferiority for me.

00:29:16.654 --> 00:29:20.158
I kept wondering how someone
as intelligent as my brother

00:29:20.658 --> 00:29:21.893
became so warped.

00:29:24.896 --> 00:29:28.466
He cared more about
people in weaker positions

00:29:28.566 --> 00:29:30.368
than about himself.

00:29:32.270 --> 00:29:36.074
And I knew better than anyone that
it wasn't just virtue-signaling.

00:29:41.546 --> 00:29:42.714
Because my brother was

00:29:46.251 --> 00:29:49.487
someone who always prioritized
my pace, no matter what.

00:29:53.491 --> 00:29:56.127
There's this phrase,
"The personal is political."

00:29:56.961 --> 00:29:59.564
Someday, you'll understand
what it means.

00:30:02.734 --> 00:30:03.902
And yet...

00:30:05.603 --> 00:30:08.006
I never even tried to
understand how my brother felt.

00:30:11.109 --> 00:30:12.143
And I said this to him.

00:30:17.115 --> 00:30:18.750
My friend told me...

00:30:20.618 --> 00:30:24.122
"Your brother's
been acting strange lately."

00:30:30.795 --> 00:30:34.299
I feel bad that you have to
go through this because of me.

00:30:36.401 --> 00:30:39.070
It wasn't our mother who gave
my brother his final despair.

00:30:42.340 --> 00:30:43.474
It was me.

00:30:47.645 --> 00:30:49.047
And now, I understand.

00:30:51.583 --> 00:30:53.084
My brother wasn't warped.

00:30:56.387 --> 00:30:58.289
The world was.

00:31:04.295 --> 00:31:07.599
He just couldn't conform to
the distorted shape of this world.

00:31:13.104 --> 00:31:14.105
So he died.

00:31:28.052 --> 00:31:29.087
But still...

00:31:33.291 --> 00:31:36.027
If I don't do it,
I won't be myself anymore.

00:31:41.566 --> 00:31:42.567
That's true.

00:31:54.846 --> 00:31:55.980
I thought we must never allow

00:31:56.047 --> 00:31:58.283
another person
like my brother to die.

00:31:59.217 --> 00:32:02.053
To make that happen, I believed
we had to change education.

00:32:03.354 --> 00:32:04.923
So l set my sights on
the Ministry of Education.

00:32:06.991 --> 00:32:11.896
But what I found there was
a massive, thoughtless organization.

00:32:14.799 --> 00:32:18.836
Some small cells were
desperately trying to move...

00:32:20.338 --> 00:32:23.474
but the rigid body
refused to budge no matter what.

00:32:26.544 --> 00:32:28.379
Then, someone told me
about his school.

00:32:29.948 --> 00:32:32.216
And I knew instantly
it was where I needed to be.

00:32:36.321 --> 00:32:42.560
Small cells must at least
face other small cells.

00:32:49.901 --> 00:32:52.170
But I realized
I hadn't been facing anything at all.

00:32:56.841 --> 00:33:02.714
While all of you were
facing it head-on.

00:33:14.292 --> 00:33:16.094
From now on,
I will never look away again.

00:33:21.566 --> 00:33:22.600
I promise.

00:34:05.743 --> 00:34:08.613
All right, shall we eat lunch?

00:34:11.082 --> 00:34:12.383
What was that?

00:34:13.117 --> 00:34:14.819
Let's eat. Time for lunch!

00:34:14.919 --> 00:34:17.555
– All right, let's go!
– All right!

00:34:17.755 --> 00:34:19.557
Let's eat. Come on.

00:34:22.860 --> 00:34:23.861
You eating?

00:34:24.028 --> 00:34:25.029
Let's eat.

00:34:31.602 --> 00:34:32.637
Okami.

00:34:36.207 --> 00:34:37.241
What is it?

00:34:40.078 --> 00:34:42.780
I met with Yuzuru the other day.

00:34:44.148 --> 00:34:45.149
You saw her?

00:34:49.187 --> 00:34:51.823
Yeah, that's all, really.

00:34:54.959 --> 00:34:56.027
How was she?

00:34:58.062 --> 00:34:59.097
Same as ever.

00:35:01.199 --> 00:35:02.200
But...

00:35:05.002 --> 00:35:07.638
We talked a little.

00:35:11.142 --> 00:35:12.143
I see.

00:35:20.284 --> 00:35:21.285
Well then.

00:35:38.970 --> 00:35:41.606
Hey, Lupin.
Load Mikami Kota's profile.

00:35:41.706 --> 00:35:42.907
Loading.

00:35:43.141 --> 00:35:44.775
Wait, what are you doing?

00:35:44.976 --> 00:35:47.645
I was just about to
erase all the related info.

00:35:49.013 --> 00:35:50.882
– Erase it?
– Yeah.

00:35:51.415 --> 00:35:54.519
As much as I can
from the internet, too.

00:35:56.354 --> 00:35:58.022
When you look at the internet

00:35:58.489 --> 00:36:00.892
you really see how prone
humans are to making mistakes.

00:36:03.861 --> 00:36:04.896
Yeah, totally.

00:36:06.964 --> 00:36:10.968
The so-called opinions that
float around online

00:36:11.869 --> 00:36:14.138
kill so many hearts and lives.

00:36:14.539 --> 00:36:19.110
Right. That's the real silent killer.

00:36:20.711 --> 00:36:22.880
How long has the internet
been around in Japan?

00:36:23.514 --> 00:36:26.017
It's been about 30 years
since regular people like us

00:36:26.117 --> 00:36:27.151
could easily access it.

00:36:27.451 --> 00:36:28.452
Wow...

00:36:28.519 --> 00:36:30.588
And this is how much presence
it has now?

00:36:31.055 --> 00:36:33.024
Has the world been
completely taken over?

00:36:33.558 --> 00:36:34.692
It's convenient.

00:36:35.493 --> 00:36:39.263
So convenient that it's hard
to imagine a world without it.

00:36:41.566 --> 00:36:42.833
True that.

00:36:46.771 --> 00:36:49.006
Right. Before deleting it...

00:36:50.541 --> 00:36:51.642
Hey, Lupin.

00:36:51.709 --> 00:36:54.812
Generate a photo
of Mikami Kota at age 39.

00:36:55.279 --> 00:36:56.280
Understood.

00:37:09.560 --> 00:37:10.595
What the?

00:37:12.930 --> 00:37:14.599
It's just a slightly older Okami.

00:37:31.515 --> 00:37:32.583
Hey, Lupin.

00:37:34.085 --> 00:37:37.989
Delete Kota Mikami's
profile completely.

00:37:39.457 --> 00:37:41.459
Do you want to
permanently delete everything?

00:37:47.865 --> 00:37:49.166
Delete it permanently?
Yes

00:37:53.337 --> 00:37:55.640
All right. All right...

00:37:56.907 --> 00:37:57.942
All right!

00:38:00.945 --> 00:38:02.480
What's with you, Jigen?

00:38:03.781 --> 00:38:05.416
What's with you, Tominaga?

00:38:10.755 --> 00:38:11.989
I don't need that.

00:38:12.323 --> 00:38:15.026
You made the effort to go
all the way to Tokyo

00:38:15.126 --> 00:38:16.394
only to say, "I'll ask him"?

00:38:16.827 --> 00:38:18.562
What are you,
a child running errands?

00:38:18.663 --> 00:38:21.799
Well, the budget for next year is
being finalized soon...

00:38:21.899 --> 00:38:23.567
So?

00:38:24.368 --> 00:38:26.871
You know full well that
Chief Cabinet Secretary Azuma

00:38:26.971 --> 00:38:29.206
has tremendous influence
over the budget...

00:38:29.307 --> 00:38:33.544
You always make that
pathetic face like a needy dog.

00:38:34.145 --> 00:38:35.846
That's why they
take advantage of you.

00:38:35.946 --> 00:38:37.014
Excuse me?

00:38:37.181 --> 00:38:40.051
If it turns out this school is
involved in misconduct

00:38:40.418 --> 00:38:43.721
what do you think will happen to
the Rintoku brand we've built?

00:38:43.821 --> 00:38:45.089
Still...

00:38:45.423 --> 00:38:49.060
Both Mr. Azuma and
Mr. Tsukada want our brand.

00:38:49.427 --> 00:38:52.229
That's what this is about!

00:38:53.364 --> 00:38:55.933
We have to show them
that it's not so easy

00:38:56.400 --> 00:38:58.502
to get what they want.

00:39:02.406 --> 00:39:06.744
Become someone truly worthy
of Rintoku, Mr. Mizobata.

00:39:24.328 --> 00:39:26.530
I give you credit
for finding me here.

00:39:26.864 --> 00:39:28.332
Yuzuru told me.

00:39:30.167 --> 00:39:31.602
You were able to meet with her?

00:39:32.570 --> 00:39:33.671
Yes.

00:39:34.638 --> 00:39:38.008
She gave me the address
on the envelope.

00:39:39.777 --> 00:39:42.546
Did she read the letter?

00:39:44.081 --> 00:39:45.082
Well...

00:39:48.152 --> 00:39:49.153
I...

00:39:49.487 --> 00:39:50.554
I see.

00:39:54.692 --> 00:39:56.160
She's stubborn, isn't she?

00:39:57.962 --> 00:39:58.963
Yeah.

00:40:01.399 --> 00:40:03.267
She's a lot like you, Ms. Saejima.

00:40:09.373 --> 00:40:10.775
You haven't been able to see her?

00:40:16.814 --> 00:40:17.882
It's okay.

00:40:19.450 --> 00:40:20.451
What?

00:40:22.119 --> 00:40:25.322
I'm sure she wants to see you.

00:40:27.825 --> 00:40:28.893
No way.

00:40:29.627 --> 00:40:33.464
Do people really just develop
kindness like that once they grow up?

00:40:33.631 --> 00:40:34.698
No, well...

00:40:35.366 --> 00:40:37.201
It's a built-in feature.

00:40:37.768 --> 00:40:39.136
I just hadn't shown it.

00:40:43.474 --> 00:40:46.644
Why did you become a teacher?

00:40:47.445 --> 00:40:50.281
I already told you.
I'm no longer a teacher.

00:40:56.086 --> 00:40:59.757
But your heart hasn't quit, has it?

00:41:06.197 --> 00:41:07.198
What?

00:41:09.934 --> 00:41:11.836
Because it's a job

00:41:12.803 --> 00:41:15.239
where you get to witness
the moment someone changes.

00:41:22.079 --> 00:41:23.380
And I...

00:41:25.916 --> 00:41:28.118
I took that away from you, didn't I?

00:41:34.458 --> 00:41:38.162
Mr. Mikami
must be a really good teacher.

00:41:40.364 --> 00:41:41.665
If you were to meet him...

00:41:45.102 --> 00:41:46.570
you'd surely regret it.

00:41:48.372 --> 00:41:49.907
What's with that?

00:41:50.774 --> 00:41:52.209
You really like him, don't you?

00:42:03.153 --> 00:42:06.790
Please tell me the truth.

00:42:10.327 --> 00:42:11.629
If I tell you...

00:42:12.696 --> 00:42:15.132
I'll stop being
even a former teacher.

00:42:36.987 --> 00:42:38.088
Welcome.

00:42:39.256 --> 00:42:41.292
What? Isn't Mr. Nakaoka here today?

00:42:41.625 --> 00:42:43.460
He's not here today.

00:42:44.828 --> 00:42:47.064
– That's a shame.
– Right this way.

00:42:57.741 --> 00:43:00.878
No going outside! Come back inside.

00:43:03.080 --> 00:43:05.082
– One highball, please.
– Certainly.

00:43:18.295 --> 00:43:19.697
Hey, we've got a customer!

00:43:43.320 --> 00:43:44.755
Have they been closed for a while?

00:43:45.389 --> 00:43:48.592
It seems Shiiba is
juggling several part-time jobs.

00:43:49.026 --> 00:43:50.894
And providing caregiving
during her spare time.

00:43:53.230 --> 00:43:55.699
I wasn't able to get
a good hearing from her.

00:43:56.333 --> 00:43:59.970
Still, it's not something
we can ignore.

00:44:00.671 --> 00:44:02.840
Yes, I agree.

00:44:04.508 --> 00:44:06.243
We need to take appropriate action.

00:44:09.747 --> 00:44:14.418
Being a teacher really
is an important job, isn't it?

00:44:16.820 --> 00:44:18.122
Where is this coming from?

00:44:20.391 --> 00:44:23.661
After hearing what you said today...

00:44:27.364 --> 00:44:28.599
I couldn't help but think...

00:44:29.967 --> 00:44:32.503
If you had been there then

00:44:34.104 --> 00:44:39.410
maybe you could have stopped
what happened with your brother.

00:44:44.081 --> 00:44:45.649
I don't see it that way.

00:44:46.950 --> 00:44:49.586
Still, I thought, "Just maybe."

00:44:58.962 --> 00:45:00.130
No matter what

00:45:01.165 --> 00:45:03.600
we have to make sure
Shiiba's life can go on.

00:45:12.643 --> 00:45:14.578
Hello, Rintoku Academy.
Mikami speaking.

00:45:16.980 --> 00:45:18.015
Yes.

00:45:20.284 --> 00:45:21.285
What?

00:45:28.025 --> 00:45:31.462
I'll head over immediately.
Please don't contact the police.

00:45:35.332 --> 00:45:38.602
Shiiba Haruno is one of my students.

00:45:43.340 --> 00:45:45.709
She has stained Rintoku's reputation.

00:45:45.809 --> 00:45:48.879
I think what she did
warrants as much.

00:45:48.979 --> 00:45:51.315
Why not draw him in
while we still can?

00:45:51.415 --> 00:45:53.016
We can bury whatever we like.

00:45:53.117 --> 00:45:56.186
If Ms. Saejima's protecting someone,
it has to be a student.

00:45:56.286 --> 00:45:58.455
Where exactly
should we direct our protest?

00:45:58.889 --> 00:46:01.859
We either bring him over to our side
or we cut him off.

00:46:01.959 --> 00:46:04.795
It's time to figure out who to keep.
