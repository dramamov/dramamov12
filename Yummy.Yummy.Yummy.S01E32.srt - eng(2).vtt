=Episode 32=

00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:47.000
Make way.

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:49.110
How could this be?

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:51.520
Oh, no.

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:52.470
Fire!

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:53.550
How could this happen?

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:56.240
Fire! Fire!

00:01:57.600 --> 00:01:58.910
Fire!

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:01.210
Fire!

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:02.680
The houses are too close together,

00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:03.760
and they are made of wood.

00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:04.810
We must put out the fire,

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:06.670
or they'll all be consumed
one after another.

00:02:06.730 --> 00:02:07.930
- Liu Chang, Cheng Hu.
- Yes.

00:02:07.930 --> 00:02:09.170
Evacuate the people here.

00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:09.710
- Yes.
- Yes.

00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:10.510
The rest of you,

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:12.820
borrow water and fire extinguishers
to put out the fire

00:02:12.820 --> 00:02:13.680
and save the people.

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:14.680
Yes.

00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:16.270
- Let's go.
- Go with Liu Chang.

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:17.950
Take care of yourself and your family.

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:19.080
Stay safe.

00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:20.870
How to deal with this?

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:22.430
We are all neighbors.

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:24.200
We can't just stand by and do nothing.

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:25.870
How could we just stand by?

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:27.760
Hurry up.

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:29.530
- Put out the fire.
- Hurry.

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:30.480
Watch over Yangyang.

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:31.810
- We will go, too.
- Be careful.

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:33.750
Ming is still in the diner.

00:02:34.990 --> 00:02:36.360
Deyuan, take care of Yangyang.

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:38.710
Fire!

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:41.590
Put out the fire!

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:42.800
Help!

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:44.870
Help!

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:46.680
Anyone there?

00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:48.480
Help!

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:50.520
Don't worry; we are here to save you.

00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:52.830
Help!

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:53.870
Be careful.

00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:57.150
Get out of the way.

00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:01.360
Lady Yun.

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:02.200
Come with me.

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:03.550
- Careful.
- Hurry up.

00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:05.360
Be careful.

00:03:36.710 --> 00:03:37.550
Go, go.

00:03:49.150 --> 00:03:50.710
You must always remember

00:03:50.870 --> 00:03:52.800
the stories of our ancestors.

00:03:53.960 --> 00:03:54.800
Later,

00:03:55.030 --> 00:03:56.430
a fire broke out

00:03:56.960 --> 00:03:58.640
at Shen's Diner.

00:03:59.960 --> 00:04:01.640
Lady Shen and her family

00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:04.680
all perished in the fire.

00:04:07.750 --> 00:04:08.590
Mr. Shen.

00:04:08.870 --> 00:04:09.710
Mr. Shen.

00:04:13.430 --> 00:04:14.270
I remember now.

00:04:15.480 --> 00:04:16.630
This is the big fire.

00:04:16.630 --> 00:04:18.040
This is the big fire!

00:04:18.800 --> 00:04:20.440
Let's go.

00:04:36.120 --> 00:04:37.060
It should be safe now.

00:04:37.190 --> 00:04:38.480
I'll go inside and check again.

00:04:38.600 --> 00:04:39.510
Be careful.

00:04:52.550 --> 00:04:53.550
Yangyang.

00:04:57.510 --> 00:04:58.350
Here.

00:04:59.600 --> 00:05:00.440
Jicai!

00:05:00.880 --> 00:05:01.620
Jicai!

00:05:01.720 --> 00:05:02.560
Jicai!

00:05:02.720 --> 00:05:03.680
Listen.

00:05:03.680 --> 00:05:04.750
I just saw Li Ang.

00:05:04.990 --> 00:05:06.560
He is likely the one who set this fire.

00:05:06.600 --> 00:05:07.840
He was holding Ming.

00:05:08.120 --> 00:05:09.510
I chased him all the way here.

00:05:09.510 --> 00:05:11.120
He must've hidden in our diner.

00:05:11.420 --> 00:05:12.430
I'll keep following him.

00:05:12.430 --> 00:05:13.720
You go and inform the Prefecture.

00:05:14.160 --> 00:05:15.600
Jicai, listen to me.

00:05:15.600 --> 00:05:16.780
In the stories Grandpa told,

00:05:16.780 --> 00:05:18.530
this fire is our end.

00:05:24.720 --> 00:05:25.600
It's too late.

00:05:25.800 --> 00:05:26.800
Yangyang is in danger.

00:05:27.480 --> 00:05:28.420
- Yangyang!
- Yangyang!

00:05:28.750 --> 00:05:29.590
Yangyang!

00:05:41.630 --> 00:05:42.470
Yangyang!

00:05:42.630 --> 00:05:43.470
Deyuan.

00:05:44.630 --> 00:05:45.470
Yangyang.

00:05:45.870 --> 00:05:46.710
Deyuan.

00:05:53.550 --> 00:05:54.550
You set the fire.

00:05:55.240 --> 00:05:56.840
Are you happy to burn down Juxian Alley?

00:05:58.360 --> 00:05:59.200
Jicai.

00:05:59.870 --> 00:06:00.710
Yangyang.

00:06:00.940 --> 00:06:01.880
- Jicai.
- Lady Shen.

00:06:01.890 --> 00:06:02.800
- Dad, Mom.
- Jicai.

00:06:02.800 --> 00:06:03.640
Get up.

00:06:03.800 --> 00:06:04.750
Jicai.

00:06:04.850 --> 00:06:05.590
Jicai.

00:06:05.600 --> 00:06:06.950
- Yangyang.
- Jicai.

00:06:06.950 --> 00:06:07.800
Yangyang.

00:06:07.900 --> 00:06:08.720
Yangyang.

00:06:08.720 --> 00:06:09.560
Are you alright?

00:06:09.950 --> 00:06:10.790
Listen to me.

00:06:11.070 --> 00:06:12.720
Let go of my daughter.

00:06:12.990 --> 00:06:14.240
- Have you gone mad?
- Jicai.

00:06:14.240 --> 00:06:15.080
Yes.

00:06:15.800 --> 00:06:16.840
I've gone mad.

00:06:17.240 --> 00:06:19.430
My father and brothers...

00:06:19.430 --> 00:06:21.120
All my siblings were implicated.

00:06:21.120 --> 00:06:22.430
How could I not have gone mad?

00:06:22.430 --> 00:06:23.950
Who can you blame?

00:06:23.950 --> 00:06:25.120
You started the rebellion!

00:06:25.120 --> 00:06:26.310
I blame you all.

00:06:27.190 --> 00:06:29.160
I want you all to die with me.

00:06:29.360 --> 00:06:30.750
How about this?

00:06:30.750 --> 00:06:32.240
You can kill me.

00:06:32.240 --> 00:06:33.880
Let go of my daughter, okay?

00:06:34.070 --> 00:06:34.920
No, no.

00:06:34.920 --> 00:06:36.040
Why kill my father

00:06:36.040 --> 00:06:37.390
and sister? Come for me.

00:06:37.390 --> 00:06:38.480
You can just kill me.

00:06:38.950 --> 00:06:40.280
What a family.

00:06:40.950 --> 00:06:42.390
What's the point of killing you all?

00:06:43.070 --> 00:06:44.630
I want Shen Shaoguang to die.

00:06:44.630 --> 00:06:46.600
I want Lin Yan
to watch Shen Shaoguang die.

00:06:46.600 --> 00:06:48.500
Go and get him now.

00:06:48.510 --> 00:06:49.510
Don't hurt her.

00:06:49.510 --> 00:06:50.910
Father, Mother, go!

00:06:51.210 --> 00:06:52.070
Li Ang,

00:06:52.070 --> 00:06:53.430
don't you only want my life?

00:06:53.430 --> 00:06:54.990
Why bother with the others?

00:06:55.280 --> 00:06:56.630
It's more trouble, isn't it?

00:06:56.630 --> 00:06:57.800
Jicai, I beg of you.

00:06:57.800 --> 00:06:58.740
Don't say anything.

00:06:58.750 --> 00:07:00.240
Don't provoke him, alright?

00:07:00.480 --> 00:07:01.320
Go.

00:07:01.630 --> 00:07:02.920
Li Ang, kill me.

00:07:02.920 --> 00:07:03.760
I beg of you.

00:07:03.770 --> 00:07:04.630
Kill me.

00:07:04.630 --> 00:07:05.480
Don't move forward.

00:07:05.480 --> 00:07:07.120
Go and get Lin Yan.

00:07:07.120 --> 00:07:07.940
Don't hurt her.

00:07:07.940 --> 00:07:08.990
- Calm down.
- I beg you.

00:07:08.990 --> 00:07:10.310
Or I will kill her.

00:07:10.310 --> 00:07:11.190
- Hurry.
- Go.

00:07:11.430 --> 00:07:12.310
Don't be impulsive.

00:07:12.680 --> 00:07:13.680
Don't hurt her.

00:07:13.680 --> 00:07:15.840
Go and get Lin Yan.

00:07:15.840 --> 00:07:16.840
Don't hurt her.

00:07:16.840 --> 00:07:18.160
Or I'll fight you to the death.

00:07:18.160 --> 00:07:19.000
Go!

00:07:20.240 --> 00:07:21.080
Jicai!

00:07:23.430 --> 00:07:24.300
Be careful.

00:07:25.190 --> 00:07:26.550
- Go!
- Go.

00:07:26.980 --> 00:07:27.960
- Jicai.
- Be careful.

00:07:28.140 --> 00:07:28.990
Lady Shen.

00:07:28.990 --> 00:07:30.240
- Jicai.
- Jicai.

00:07:30.240 --> 00:07:31.950
- Be careful.
- Jicai.

00:07:32.040 --> 00:07:33.330
- Go!
- Go!

00:07:35.600 --> 00:07:36.800
Jicai!

00:07:37.990 --> 00:07:38.840
What to do?

00:07:38.990 --> 00:07:39.920
Jicai!

00:07:44.950 --> 00:07:45.790
Li Ang,

00:07:46.720 --> 00:07:47.560
listen to me.

00:07:48.120 --> 00:07:48.960
Listen to me.

00:07:49.390 --> 00:07:51.390
I truly understand how you feel.

00:07:51.390 --> 00:07:52.240
You hate Lin Yan

00:07:52.680 --> 00:07:54.280
because he exposed Prince Zhao,

00:07:54.720 --> 00:07:55.800
and Prince Zhao

00:07:55.800 --> 00:07:57.160
had always favored him.

00:07:57.870 --> 00:07:59.120
What you long for the most

00:07:59.430 --> 00:08:01.070
is your father's approval,

00:08:01.430 --> 00:08:02.270
isn't it?

00:08:03.720 --> 00:08:05.160
But your brother Li Sheng

00:08:05.160 --> 00:08:06.800
outshone you.

00:08:06.800 --> 00:08:07.640
Lin Yan

00:08:07.950 --> 00:08:09.390
looked like your brother

00:08:09.680 --> 00:08:11.160
and caught your father's attention.

00:08:11.160 --> 00:08:12.280
It's not fair.

00:08:23.040 --> 00:08:24.310
Lin Yan is nothing.

00:08:24.750 --> 00:08:26.510
Your father loves you the most.

00:08:26.870 --> 00:08:28.390
Why compare yourself to an adopted son?

00:08:28.870 --> 00:08:30.430
You are so smart; you don't need me

00:08:30.430 --> 00:08:31.800
to tell you that.

00:08:33.120 --> 00:08:34.960
You don't need to be jealous of Lin Yan.

00:08:35.240 --> 00:08:36.790
You are the one

00:08:36.790 --> 00:08:38.120
your father loves the most.

00:08:41.270 --> 00:08:42.480
Stop trying to confuse me.

00:08:43.120 --> 00:08:44.390
If not for you and Lin Yan,

00:08:44.710 --> 00:08:47.030
I wouldn't be in this situation.

00:08:49.910 --> 00:08:51.320
You conspired with Prince Zhao,

00:08:51.320 --> 00:08:52.060
harming the people.

00:08:52.140 --> 00:08:53.600
Your father set up Lin Yan's family,

00:08:53.600 --> 00:08:54.760
causing their wrongful deaths.

00:08:54.820 --> 00:08:55.720
You all deserve

00:08:55.720 --> 00:08:56.660
to die.

00:09:04.870 --> 00:09:05.710
I'm too late.

00:09:09.200 --> 00:09:10.040
Lin Yan.

00:09:10.840 --> 00:09:12.240
I want you to die.

00:09:17.440 --> 00:09:18.280
Be careful.

00:09:43.510 --> 00:09:44.350
What?

00:09:44.960 --> 00:09:46.990
You remember growing up with me,

00:09:47.670 --> 00:09:48.630
so you can't do this?

00:09:49.480 --> 00:09:50.320
Lin Yan,

00:09:50.480 --> 00:09:52.080
you are too emotional.

00:09:53.510 --> 00:09:55.480
Let's die together.

00:09:56.960 --> 00:09:57.800
Lin Yan!

00:10:24.320 --> 00:10:25.600
It hurts so much.

00:10:26.630 --> 00:10:28.750
When you saved me in Sushui City,

00:10:28.750 --> 00:10:29.990
you were more seriously injured,

00:10:30.270 --> 00:10:32.150
but you never let go of my hand.

00:10:41.480 --> 00:10:42.320
Jicai.

00:10:42.560 --> 00:10:43.400
Jicai.

00:10:46.670 --> 00:10:47.560
Your injury.

00:10:47.560 --> 00:10:48.400
It's okay.

00:10:51.320 --> 00:10:52.160
Come on.

00:11:04.560 --> 00:11:05.600
I'll take you out of here.

00:11:06.200 --> 00:11:07.040
Let's go.

00:11:28.750 --> 00:11:30.270
Jicai, listen to me.

00:11:30.270 --> 00:11:31.360
In the stories Grandpa told,

00:11:31.360 --> 00:11:33.150
this fire is our end.

00:11:33.790 --> 00:11:35.320
(This is the end.)

00:11:36.320 --> 00:11:38.360

in the predetermined history.)

00:11:38.910 --> 00:11:41.120
(A thousand years later,
our family still exists.)

00:11:41.750 --> 00:11:43.910
(So, history will not change.)

00:11:43.910 --> 00:11:45.030
(We will not die.)

00:11:45.360 --> 00:11:46.560
(We will disappear.)

00:11:47.270 --> 00:11:48.110
We will

00:11:48.670 --> 00:11:49.910
go back to the modern era.

00:11:53.080 --> 00:11:53.920
Hurry up.

00:11:54.360 --> 00:11:55.200
Hurry.

00:11:55.200 --> 00:11:56.600

What's wrong?

00:12:38.840 --> 00:12:40.150
We have to say goodbye.

00:12:46.320 --> 00:12:48.750

00:12:50.240 --> 00:12:52.120

Young Master,

00:14:46.990 --> 00:14:48.810
you started searching
once the fire was out.

00:14:48.960 --> 00:14:50.670
What are you looking for? Tell me.

00:14:50.670 --> 00:14:52.670
I'll help you, okay?

00:14:52.670 --> 00:14:53.510
No matter what,

00:14:53.790 --> 00:14:55.280
there should at least be some remains.

Remains?

00:15:06.390 --> 00:15:07.510
Mr. Cui, greetings.

00:15:07.910 --> 00:15:09.960
Thank you for saving us last night.

00:15:09.960 --> 00:15:10.800
Last night,

00:15:10.810 --> 00:15:12.440
it was Lady Shen who saved you.

00:15:12.910 --> 00:15:13.750
Don't you remember?

00:15:13.750 --> 00:15:15.840
Lady Shen?

00:15:15.840 --> 00:15:17.870
It was you and the Prefecture officials

00:15:18.240 --> 00:15:19.150
who saved us.

00:15:19.870 --> 00:15:20.710
What about the family

00:15:20.870 --> 00:15:22.500
that ran the diner here?

00:15:23.200 --> 00:15:24.820
This house has been abandoned for years.

00:15:25.080 --> 00:15:26.200
We've never seen

00:15:26.200 --> 00:15:27.360
any diner.

00:15:27.720 --> 00:15:28.870
You're wrong.

00:15:28.870 --> 00:15:29.720
Young Master,

00:15:29.820 --> 00:15:31.240
I've told you many times.

00:15:31.240 --> 00:15:32.670
We don't know any Shen family.

00:15:32.840 --> 00:15:33.990
You must be confused

00:15:33.990 --> 00:15:35.310
from putting out the fire.

00:15:35.990 --> 00:15:36.830
It's impossible.

00:15:37.870 --> 00:15:38.710
Impossible.

00:15:42.120 --> 00:15:42.960
It's impossible.

00:15:44.390 --> 00:15:45.240
Impossible.

and...

00:16:50.150 --> 00:16:51.960
And who else?

00:16:55.270 --> 00:16:57.990
I remembered this morning
when I talked to Liu Chang.

00:16:58.020 --> 00:17:00.320
(The Shen family of five,
Shen Shaoguang, Shen Jian She)

00:17:16.870 --> 00:17:18.000
Shen...

00:17:22.950 --> 00:17:23.790
Young Master,

00:17:24.520 --> 00:17:27.000
the Shen family never existed.

00:17:27.430 --> 00:17:28.520
Forget about them.

00:17:29.670 --> 00:17:31.390
Don't make yourself feel bad.

00:17:36.390 --> 00:17:38.280
They did exist.

00:17:41.080 --> 00:17:41.920
Liu Chang,

00:17:43.770 --> 00:17:45.000
if even you don't believe me...

00:17:45.000 --> 00:17:45.840
I believe you.

00:17:49.910 --> 00:17:50.800
I believe you.

00:17:58.190 --> 00:17:59.080
She was once

00:18:00.630 --> 00:18:02.000
my wife.

00:18:03.800 --> 00:18:05.000
They were once

00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:07.360
my family.

00:18:12.460 --> 00:18:14.740
(The Shen family of five,
Shen Shaoguang, Shen Jian She)

00:18:14.760 --> 00:18:15.840
But every day,

00:18:17.280 --> 00:18:18.630
I forget a little more.

00:18:21.080 --> 00:18:22.680
If this continues,

00:18:24.760 --> 00:18:26.190
I will forget her one day.

00:18:28.080 --> 00:18:29.150
Then, in this world,

00:18:31.190 --> 00:18:32.760
who will remember them?

00:18:34.760 --> 00:18:36.360
And what can I remember?

00:21:02.520 --> 00:21:03.360
Young Master,

00:21:04.360 --> 00:21:05.470
what's this?

00:21:06.840 --> 00:21:07.680
This is the diner

00:21:09.080 --> 00:21:11.470
she ran with her family.

00:21:12.080 --> 00:21:13.320
Before I forget,

00:21:14.320 --> 00:21:15.520
I must draw what it looks like.

00:21:17.520 --> 00:21:18.560
It was the place

00:21:19.120 --> 00:21:20.800
where we spent every day together.

00:21:22.390 --> 00:21:23.630
If I look at it every day,

00:21:25.150 --> 00:21:26.520
I won't forget.

00:21:29.230 --> 00:21:30.670
If she ever comes back

00:21:32.390 --> 00:21:33.870
and sees the diner

00:21:35.800 --> 00:21:36.800
is still there,

00:21:38.630 --> 00:21:40.280
she won't feel lost.

00:28:05.170 --> 00:28:06.670
and we found you fainted here.

00:28:06.670 --> 00:28:08.040
Don't scare us like this.

00:28:08.320 --> 00:28:09.160
Auntie,

00:28:09.320 --> 00:28:11.360
did you faint from heatstroke?

00:28:11.630 --> 00:28:13.230
Grandma has called the hospital.

00:28:13.360 --> 00:28:14.670
The ambulance will be here soon.

00:28:14.910 --> 00:28:16.520
Yes, the ambulance will be here soon.

00:28:19.160 --> 00:28:20.040
Auntie.

00:28:20.040 --> 00:28:21.150
Why is she crying?

00:28:21.430 --> 00:28:22.430
What's the matter?

00:28:23.000 --> 00:28:24.190
- Don't cry.
- What's wrong?

00:28:24.190 --> 00:28:25.600
- She's gone silly.
- Are you okay?

00:28:25.640 --> 00:28:26.320
She's gone silly.

00:28:26.320 --> 00:28:27.520
Don't talk nonsense.

00:28:27.520 --> 00:28:28.620
- Stop it.
- Jicai.

00:28:29.040 --> 00:28:30.110
It's okay, it's okay.

00:28:30.110 --> 00:28:30.980
What should we do?

00:28:30.990 --> 00:28:31.950
Your mom is here.

00:28:34.880 --> 00:28:36.280

- Thanks.
- So popular.

Come by and have a meal.

00:29:44.320 --> 00:29:45.630
I won't be able to get a table.

Of course, you can.

- Goodbye.
- Okay, bye.

Listen.

Ever since Jicai's video

00:31:03.800 --> 00:31:04.670
made our diner

popular,

00:31:06.360 --> 00:31:07.560
I've somehow felt more

00:31:07.560 --> 00:31:09.630
and more inspired while working.

00:31:10.700 --> 00:31:11.600
I seem to have

00:31:11.600 --> 00:31:12.670
more energy.

00:31:13.000 --> 00:31:14.140
That's great.

Got it. Stay humble and focused.

00:31:28.180 --> 00:31:30.320
Here comes the Agate Meat
that took down the villain.

00:31:30.320 --> 00:31:31.320

00:31:33.250 --> 00:31:34.090
Go for it.

00:31:36.230 --> 00:31:37.030
Miss,

00:31:37.030 --> 00:31:38.170
the bill for Table 3, please.

00:31:38.210 --> 00:31:39.080
Sure.

00:31:39.080 --> 00:31:39.920
Over here.

00:31:41.040 --> 00:31:42.440
Yangyang, Table 3.

00:31:47.560 --> 00:31:48.820
What a genius.

00:31:49.120 --> 00:31:50.800
You did the math just by looking at it?

00:31:51.190 --> 00:31:52.040
So adorable.

00:31:52.430 --> 00:31:53.270
So cute.

00:31:53.670 --> 00:31:54.600
Thank you.

00:31:54.600 --> 00:31:55.790
- Goodbye.
- Come again.

Auntie,

00:31:57.870 --> 00:31:59.230
thanks to your short videos

00:31:59.230 --> 00:32:00.460

an internet sensation.

I didn't invent the new dishes.

00:32:06.230 --> 00:32:07.600
I just brought over the dishes

00:32:07.600 --> 00:32:09.040
we made in ancient times.

00:32:09.760 --> 00:32:10.600
Auntie,

00:32:11.000 --> 00:32:12.950
are you still thinking about that dream

00:32:13.120 --> 00:32:14.470
where you met our ancestor?

00:32:15.390 --> 00:32:17.230
But didn't Grandpa and Grandma

00:32:17.470 --> 00:32:18.800
ask you to forget about it?

00:32:22.120 --> 00:32:23.360

00:32:23.670 --> 00:32:24.600

00:32:24.600 --> 00:32:26.070
(start cooking such delicious food?)

00:32:26.670 --> 00:32:28.710
(Why did Gongcai suddenly become
so diligent?)

00:32:29.280 --> 00:32:30.320
(And Yangyang,)

Jicai,

00:33:15.520 --> 00:33:17.520
these cherries your dad bought online

00:33:17.670 --> 00:33:19.270
are really fresh. Try some.

We've told you

00:33:28.840 --> 00:33:30.760
that what you write is your privacy,

00:33:31.000 --> 00:33:32.040
and we won't snoop.

00:33:33.600 --> 00:33:35.120
But you've been

00:33:35.120 --> 00:33:36.000
absent-minded

00:33:36.000 --> 00:33:36.840
and upset lately.

00:33:37.800 --> 00:33:39.190
We're worried about you.

00:33:39.950 --> 00:33:41.040
I'm fine.

00:33:41.840 --> 00:33:42.950
I just...

00:33:43.030 --> 00:33:44.560
You're still thinking about that dream.

00:33:44.560 --> 00:33:45.400
Right?

00:33:48.280 --> 00:33:49.320
Silly girl.

00:33:49.630 --> 00:33:51.120
I told you.

00:33:51.360 --> 00:33:52.710

once you wake up from the dream,

00:34:00.720 --> 00:34:01.560
you should live

00:34:06.070 --> 00:34:07.390
I know what I'm doing.

00:34:07.390 --> 00:34:09.460
I'm just a bit obsessed lately.

00:34:09.460 --> 00:34:10.670
It's like chasing a celebrity.

00:34:10.670 --> 00:34:11.830
I'll be fine in a few days.

00:34:12.000 --> 00:34:13.960
When I chase a celebrity,

00:34:13.960 --> 00:34:15.670
I can only last a few months at most.

00:34:17.750 --> 00:34:18.590
Okay.

00:34:19.080 --> 00:34:21.190
I hope you let this go soon.

00:34:21.520 --> 00:34:23.070
Stop overthinking it, okay?

00:34:24.520 --> 00:34:26.080
Alright, it's about time.

00:34:26.080 --> 00:34:27.150
Go to bed now.

00:34:27.150 --> 00:34:27.990
Okay.

00:34:28.600 --> 00:34:29.930
Don't forget to eat the cherries.

00:34:32.790 --> 00:34:34.040
I'll close the door for you.

The white peach oolong

00:35:30.480 --> 00:35:31.860
and the matcha are good.

00:35:31.860 --> 00:35:33.700

The white peach one.
