00:00:03.503 --> 00:00:04.704
Yudai?

00:00:10.610 --> 00:00:12.479
Who are you?

00:00:15.382 --> 00:00:16.716
I'm her...

00:00:18.084 --> 00:00:19.652
ex-husband.

00:00:25.625 --> 00:00:28.995
- Who are you and what are you doing?
- Stop it.

00:00:30.597 --> 00:00:31.664
Kotaro.

00:00:33.066 --> 00:00:34.200
I'm sorry.

00:00:35.535 --> 00:00:39.072
Can I get back to you later?

00:00:41.041 --> 00:00:42.142
I understand.

00:00:49.015 --> 00:00:50.050
But...

00:00:53.453 --> 00:00:54.621
no matter what happens

00:00:56.990 --> 00:00:58.058
I'm

00:00:59.159 --> 00:01:00.860
on your side, Minori.

00:01:05.665 --> 00:01:07.434
What was that?

00:01:10.870 --> 00:01:12.072
Are you okay?

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:14.774
Yeah.

00:01:16.709 --> 00:01:18.611
Why are you here?

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:25.318
I'M SORRY FOR THE OTHER DAY.

00:01:25.385 --> 00:01:28.788
I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO SAY,
BUT I DON'T CARE HOW LONG IT TAKES...

00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:41.201
Don't make my mom suffer any more.

00:02:01.354 --> 00:02:03.323
What happened between

00:02:04.257 --> 00:02:05.658
you and my mom in the past?

00:02:06.226 --> 00:02:07.494
What?

00:02:10.029 --> 00:02:13.466
I KNOW YOUR PAST WITH WATARU MIYAKE.
DO YOU THINK YOU'RE FORGIVEN?

00:02:19.639 --> 00:02:21.975
What is this?

00:02:24.577 --> 00:02:26.112
It's your fault.

00:02:28.948 --> 00:02:30.984
Things got messed up
since you arrived.

00:03:22.769 --> 00:03:27.507
UNTIL I DESTROYED
MY HUSBAND'S OTHER FAMILY

00:03:27.574 --> 00:03:29.576
I KNOW YOUR PAST WITH WATARU MIYAKE.
DO YOU THINK YOU'RE FORGIVEN?

00:03:29.642 --> 00:03:31.144
What the hell is this?

00:03:31.711 --> 00:03:32.979
Don't play dumb.

00:03:34.581 --> 00:03:36.883
- It was you, wasn't it?
- Huh?

00:03:38.351 --> 00:03:41.321
Why? Why would you do
something like this?

00:03:41.387 --> 00:03:44.457
Calm down! I didn't do this.

00:03:44.524 --> 00:03:47.293
I didn't know anything
until Riko told me.

00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:48.962
I didn't know Wataru had moved here.

00:03:49.028 --> 00:03:50.063
Riko?

00:03:52.565 --> 00:03:53.600
You're...

00:03:54.801 --> 00:03:56.769
still in contact with her?

00:03:57.937 --> 00:03:59.305
Well, uh...

00:04:01.774 --> 00:04:03.476
Did that woman do this too?

00:04:04.844 --> 00:04:07.680
Did she tell you to come
and spy on us?

00:04:07.747 --> 00:04:09.682
- No.
- Then why?

00:04:10.950 --> 00:04:12.485
Uh, well...

00:04:14.120 --> 00:04:15.955
All this time

00:04:17.190 --> 00:04:18.891
I thought about you and Tsubasa.

00:04:24.731 --> 00:04:26.199
I was feeling remorse

00:04:27.834 --> 00:04:29.335
for seven years.

00:04:32.238 --> 00:04:35.875
Of course, I won't say
we should start over, but...

00:04:39.412 --> 00:04:41.514
Just once in a while

00:04:44.250 --> 00:04:45.418
can't I come

00:04:47.186 --> 00:04:48.988
and visit you two like this?

00:04:55.895 --> 00:04:57.063
Go home.

00:05:14.447 --> 00:05:15.615
Minori...

00:05:18.284 --> 00:05:20.453
Tsubasa has a quiet life now.

00:05:22.121 --> 00:05:24.757
He doesn't ask about you these days.

00:05:26.359 --> 00:05:28.094
I don't want to upset him.

00:05:35.802 --> 00:05:37.303
Seven years have passed, you know.

00:05:39.539 --> 00:05:40.673
We're already

00:05:41.374 --> 00:05:43.910
leading a new life now.

00:05:45.978 --> 00:05:48.314
Why can't you live your life, too?

00:06:02.762 --> 00:06:03.930
So that makes you think

00:06:04.897 --> 00:06:06.532
dating Wataru is a good idea?

00:06:08.835 --> 00:06:09.836
What?

00:06:12.038 --> 00:06:15.108
What are you thinking?
He's Riko's son, you know.

00:06:20.913 --> 00:06:22.715
Of all people...

00:06:29.222 --> 00:06:30.423
Why...

00:06:32.125 --> 00:06:33.659
does it have to be Wataru?

00:06:36.362 --> 00:06:37.630
Do you really think

00:06:39.432 --> 00:06:41.834
you can be happy with him?

00:06:50.710 --> 00:06:52.311
Megu.

00:06:52.378 --> 00:06:53.613
What is it?

00:07:08.795 --> 00:07:12.465
WATARU, WE NEED TO TALK.
DO YOU HAVE TIME?

00:07:13.900 --> 00:07:15.334
Mr. Miyake, over here.

00:07:18.404 --> 00:07:19.505
Let me see.

00:07:34.353 --> 00:07:36.823
- Sorry to call you over so suddenly.
- It's okay.

00:07:37.657 --> 00:07:39.392
I wanted to talk to you too.

00:07:55.141 --> 00:07:56.776
I heard from Tsubasa

00:07:57.910 --> 00:07:59.412
about the threatening letter.

00:08:01.547 --> 00:08:02.782
Tsubasa told you?

00:08:06.118 --> 00:08:07.320
I want to apologize.

00:08:09.522 --> 00:08:10.590
Maybe

00:08:11.491 --> 00:08:13.226
it was created by my mom.

00:08:16.128 --> 00:08:17.396
I'm so sorry.

00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:22.468
I'll handle it.

00:08:23.102 --> 00:08:26.005
I'll talk to her and make her stop.

00:08:29.642 --> 00:08:30.877
Don't worry about it.

00:08:34.080 --> 00:08:37.884
I feel that we shouldn't have met
in the first place.

00:08:43.489 --> 00:08:44.690
You know what?

00:08:45.658 --> 00:08:47.360
I decided to move away
from this town.

00:08:49.428 --> 00:08:50.963
Why do you have to go?

00:08:53.699 --> 00:08:56.669
- You didn't do anything bad.
- Wataru.

00:08:57.370 --> 00:08:58.838
That's not true.

00:09:01.340 --> 00:09:03.342
Because I used you

00:09:04.277 --> 00:09:05.711
to get back at Riko and hurt her.

00:09:09.315 --> 00:09:10.550
That's the sin I committed.

00:09:12.885 --> 00:09:14.120
It's not fair...

00:09:16.222 --> 00:09:18.624
Then I'd go with you.

00:09:23.696 --> 00:09:24.864
There's someone else

00:09:26.465 --> 00:09:27.900
I'm going with.

00:09:30.870 --> 00:09:32.438
Is it Mr. Taguchi?

00:09:45.284 --> 00:09:46.285
Why?

00:09:54.727 --> 00:09:57.663
I take responsibility
for what happened.

00:09:59.465 --> 00:10:01.300
I'm going to support

00:10:03.603 --> 00:10:06.472
Minori and Tsubasa properly.

00:10:12.378 --> 00:10:13.446
Minori.

00:10:15.414 --> 00:10:16.549
Is it true?

00:10:20.119 --> 00:10:21.721
With all that's happened?

00:10:23.823 --> 00:10:24.824
Why would you...

00:10:28.227 --> 00:10:29.328
Because Yudai

00:10:30.296 --> 00:10:31.464
regrets what he did.

00:10:36.168 --> 00:10:40.740
It's better for Tsubasa to have
his real dad back, right?

00:10:41.540 --> 00:10:43.142
What about your feelings?

00:10:46.012 --> 00:10:47.813
Are really you fine with it?

00:10:50.516 --> 00:10:54.587
I promise to protect you.
Both you and Tsubasa.

00:10:55.855 --> 00:10:56.856
So please...

00:11:02.028 --> 00:11:03.262
You're bothersome to me.

00:11:11.671 --> 00:11:14.206
If only I weren't a coward...

00:11:17.510 --> 00:11:18.711
The fact that

00:11:19.779 --> 00:11:22.314
you have feelings for me

00:11:24.183 --> 00:11:25.484
is bothersome for me.

00:11:30.656 --> 00:11:31.724
So...

00:11:34.026 --> 00:11:35.027
I'm sorry.

00:11:37.630 --> 00:11:38.731
If only

00:11:40.232 --> 00:11:41.901
I could express

00:11:44.103 --> 00:11:46.806
my honest feelings...

00:11:48.407 --> 00:11:49.475
I'm sorry.

00:11:55.147 --> 00:11:57.149
Things got messed up
since you arrived.

00:12:00.052 --> 00:12:01.120
My mom

00:12:02.254 --> 00:12:04.123
stopped laughing again.

00:12:10.963 --> 00:12:12.231
I understand.

00:12:16.869 --> 00:12:18.070
I'm sorry.

00:12:20.239 --> 00:12:22.908
I rushed ahead
without considering your feelings.

00:12:43.729 --> 00:12:46.132
I wanted to make you happy.

00:12:49.535 --> 00:12:50.803
I loved you so much.

00:12:56.942 --> 00:12:58.377
This is how it should be.

00:13:00.913 --> 00:13:01.981
I'm not allowed

00:13:04.450 --> 00:13:06.418
to choose him.

00:13:11.757 --> 00:13:12.892
Yudai.

00:13:14.126 --> 00:13:15.394
I need your cooperation.

00:13:35.881 --> 00:13:37.783
What happened between

00:13:38.350 --> 00:13:40.219
you and my mom in the past?

00:13:48.694 --> 00:13:49.895
Tsubasa.

00:13:52.331 --> 00:13:53.866
Let's play games at my house today.

00:13:53.933 --> 00:13:55.634
Um, okay.

00:13:55.701 --> 00:13:57.469
I'll go and set it up. See you later.

00:13:57.536 --> 00:13:58.671
Bye-bye.

00:14:17.990 --> 00:14:20.125
Tsubasa has a quiet life now.

00:14:21.794 --> 00:14:24.463
He doesn't ask about you these days.

00:14:25.965 --> 00:14:27.833
I don't want to upset him.

00:14:53.359 --> 00:14:55.527
Um, I'm sorry about the other day

00:14:55.594 --> 00:14:58.497
for losing my composure.

00:14:58.564 --> 00:15:02.935
Don't be. A letter like that
would cause anybody to panic.

00:15:03.002 --> 00:15:06.672
I'm so sorry, Mr. Taguchi.
I should've known it couldn't be you.

00:15:06.739 --> 00:15:07.873
It's all right.

00:15:09.541 --> 00:15:11.377
By the way...

00:15:14.813 --> 00:15:16.282
the reason I came here today is...

00:15:19.318 --> 00:15:20.352
This.

00:15:22.321 --> 00:15:23.789
Have you seen it?

THE OWNER IS
IN A ROMANTIC RELATIONSHIP

00:15:33.332 --> 00:15:34.433
WITH A YOUNGER TEACHER "M"

00:15:34.500 --> 00:15:37.770
"M" WAS IN HIGH SCHOOL
WHEN THE TRAMP SEDUCED HIM

00:15:41.040 --> 00:15:42.207
What's this?

00:15:43.275 --> 00:15:44.910
I didn't want to scare you.

00:15:46.045 --> 00:15:47.446
But this is a small town.

00:15:48.580 --> 00:15:50.916
These kinds of rumors
spread very quickly.

00:15:52.351 --> 00:15:54.286
I would be worried about Tsubasa.

00:15:59.425 --> 00:16:01.660
Are you all right, Minori?

00:16:05.664 --> 00:16:07.733
I can understand
you being shocked by this.

00:16:07.800 --> 00:16:10.169
But you should deal with this
as soon as possible.

00:16:12.137 --> 00:16:13.639
If there's anything I can do

00:16:14.139 --> 00:16:15.975
I will help in any way.

00:16:21.347 --> 00:16:22.614
Do you have any idea

00:16:23.282 --> 00:16:24.883
who the culprit could be?

00:16:27.286 --> 00:16:28.454
Culprit...

00:16:41.033 --> 00:16:42.768
It could be Mr. Miyake's...

00:16:45.104 --> 00:16:46.638
mom.

00:16:51.043 --> 00:16:52.144
I see.

00:16:54.847 --> 00:16:56.582
It's hard to believe, though...

00:16:58.083 --> 00:17:00.686
What mom would degrade her own son?

00:17:05.124 --> 00:17:07.693
Anyway, we should
report it to the police.

00:17:09.395 --> 00:17:10.629
Wait.

00:17:12.431 --> 00:17:15.834
If we consulted the police,
Mr. Miyake would be...

00:17:21.240 --> 00:17:22.674
Pull yourself together.

00:17:24.410 --> 00:17:26.311
Mr. Miyake is a full grown adult.

00:17:28.047 --> 00:17:29.214
What's more important

00:17:30.282 --> 00:17:32.084
is to protect Tsubasa.

00:17:37.256 --> 00:17:39.458
It's always the children
who are at the mercy

00:17:41.360 --> 00:17:43.062
of adult circumstances.

What mom would degrade her own son?

00:18:32.611 --> 00:18:33.779
Hello?

00:18:35.647 --> 00:18:37.883
There's something
I want you to look into.

00:18:56.869 --> 00:18:58.203
What the hell...

00:19:06.678 --> 00:19:07.746
Mom?

00:19:09.348 --> 00:19:10.449
What happened?

00:19:15.254 --> 00:19:16.255
Where's Reika?

00:19:17.990 --> 00:19:19.925
It's that woman's fault.

00:19:21.527 --> 00:19:23.328
For these seven years

00:19:24.863 --> 00:19:29.835
I worked like crazy
only for the sake of you and Reika.

00:19:31.603 --> 00:19:34.273
I forgot all about the past.

00:19:37.042 --> 00:19:38.210
And yet...

00:19:38.944 --> 00:19:41.146
Excuse me for disturbing you
on your break, Riko.

00:19:41.213 --> 00:19:42.514
Can we talk to for a minute?

00:19:42.581 --> 00:19:45.350
- What's the matter?
- Did you see our online reviews?

00:19:49.154 --> 00:19:51.089
THE OWNER RIKO HAD AN AFFAIR
SHE EVEN HAD A KID WITH A MARRIED MAN

00:19:51.156 --> 00:19:52.357
What is this?

00:19:53.192 --> 00:19:56.028
Bad rumors spread quickly.

00:19:56.094 --> 00:19:59.498
Customers and staff have all left.

00:19:59.565 --> 00:20:02.935
I wasn't supposed to be born, was I?

00:20:05.304 --> 00:20:07.372
What are you saying?

00:20:07.439 --> 00:20:09.541
Why do you think so?

00:20:11.109 --> 00:20:12.711
My friend said

00:20:13.345 --> 00:20:16.481
"Reika is an illegitimate child."

00:20:17.416 --> 00:20:20.285
My friends don't play
with me anymore.

00:20:26.491 --> 00:20:27.526
Where is Reika?

00:20:29.661 --> 00:20:30.896
Where is she now?

00:20:33.899 --> 00:20:37.135
She's living with my parents now.

00:20:46.545 --> 00:20:48.413
I have no doubt it was that woman

00:20:49.047 --> 00:20:50.916
who posted the rumors.

00:20:55.854 --> 00:20:56.955
It's been...

00:20:57.489 --> 00:20:59.858
seven years already.

00:21:00.993 --> 00:21:04.396
She still hasn't forgiven me.

00:21:07.733 --> 00:21:09.701
She took you from me.

00:21:10.435 --> 00:21:12.738
And now she's taken my work,
and Reika too.

00:21:15.641 --> 00:21:16.808
Minori is not

00:21:19.211 --> 00:21:20.646
someone who could do that.

00:21:24.516 --> 00:21:28.120
Why are you taking her side?

00:21:28.186 --> 00:21:32.224
She's the devil!
Why can't you see that?

00:21:33.425 --> 00:21:35.627
I'll never forgive her.

00:21:40.032 --> 00:21:41.066
Is that why

00:21:42.968 --> 00:21:44.736
you took revenge on Minori?

00:21:48.340 --> 00:21:51.209
- What are you talking about?
- Don't play dumb.

00:21:53.045 --> 00:21:55.814
It was you who sent her
the threatening letter, wasn't it?

00:21:56.448 --> 00:21:57.816
Threatening letter?

00:22:01.687 --> 00:22:02.754
Oh.

00:22:06.558 --> 00:22:09.795
I receive threatening letters
every day.

00:22:09.861 --> 00:22:12.831
I just know
that woman is sending them to me.

00:22:15.701 --> 00:22:16.735
This is...

00:22:16.802 --> 00:22:19.404
DO YOU THINK A MISTRESS
COULD FIND HAPPINESS?

00:22:32.651 --> 00:22:34.086
Hey, Wataru.

00:22:36.621 --> 00:22:38.623
Can't you come home?

00:22:43.862 --> 00:22:46.398
Aren't we family?

00:22:48.734 --> 00:22:50.068
You still are

00:22:51.470 --> 00:22:56.007
my very precious only son.

00:22:58.810 --> 00:23:00.345
I understand you

00:23:01.313 --> 00:23:05.183
better than anyone else.

00:23:18.397 --> 00:23:19.498
Mom.

00:23:23.869 --> 00:23:24.870
I'm sorry.

00:23:29.541 --> 00:23:30.675
Wataru?

00:23:32.844 --> 00:23:34.012
I can no longer

00:23:36.314 --> 00:23:38.250
live with you, Mom.

00:23:42.020 --> 00:23:43.321
Wataru.

00:23:45.290 --> 00:23:46.425
I'm going now.

00:23:48.827 --> 00:23:50.028
Wataru.

00:24:03.608 --> 00:24:06.778
My mom wasn't the one who
sent a letter to Minori.

00:24:08.213 --> 00:24:10.382
Whoever is sending the letters
to my mom

00:24:11.116 --> 00:24:12.617
is probably the same person.

00:24:14.553 --> 00:24:15.754
Who could it be?

00:24:42.647 --> 00:24:45.116
- Did you see it?
- Yeah, I did.

00:24:45.183 --> 00:24:47.452
- He's got a problem.
- He does, doesn't he?

00:24:47.519 --> 00:24:50.222
I was told not to be
friends with him, too.

00:25:00.832 --> 00:25:01.933
Let's go home together.

00:25:09.741 --> 00:25:10.942
Aren't parents

00:25:11.776 --> 00:25:12.844
the most self-centered?

00:25:14.613 --> 00:25:16.882
I had a tough time, too.

00:25:18.783 --> 00:25:19.818
What?

00:25:21.052 --> 00:25:24.155
My mom left home one day
without warning.

00:25:26.558 --> 00:25:27.626
She said

00:25:28.193 --> 00:25:30.395
she couldn't be happy
with dad anymore.

00:25:33.198 --> 00:25:35.934
After that, by chance

00:25:36.601 --> 00:25:38.236
I saw my mom walking holding hands.

00:25:38.970 --> 00:25:40.972
with a man who wasn't my dad.

00:25:49.114 --> 00:25:50.348
Grown-ups are self-centered.

00:25:51.149 --> 00:25:52.317
That's how it is.

00:25:55.554 --> 00:25:57.455
Yeah. They are.

00:26:01.293 --> 00:26:02.460
But you know

00:26:04.462 --> 00:26:05.864
I can't hate her.

00:26:07.866 --> 00:26:09.000
I don't hate my mom.

00:26:13.772 --> 00:26:15.073
Isn't it the same with you?

00:26:16.274 --> 00:26:17.642
You still love your dad

00:26:18.310 --> 00:26:19.477
don't you?

00:26:22.948 --> 00:26:24.115
I thought

00:26:25.350 --> 00:26:29.054
I have to hate my mom

00:26:30.055 --> 00:26:32.724
who left us and disappeared.

00:26:33.925 --> 00:26:34.993
But

00:26:36.494 --> 00:26:40.565
my dad told me
it's okay to still love her.

00:26:42.901 --> 00:26:46.504
He said I don't have to
force myself to forget her.

00:26:48.773 --> 00:26:51.676
Although I know
it's tough on him, too.

00:26:54.713 --> 00:26:58.450
I'm going to believe in my dad
no matter what happens.

00:26:59.718 --> 00:27:02.253
I will always love my dad.

00:27:03.989 --> 00:27:05.290
So Tsubasa

00:27:06.091 --> 00:27:07.559
I don't know what went on

00:27:08.126 --> 00:27:10.595
between your mom and Mr. Miyake

00:27:12.397 --> 00:27:15.567
but I think you should be the one
who believes in her.

00:27:25.110 --> 00:27:26.311
TO TSUBASA

00:27:26.378 --> 00:27:29.748
THANK YOU FOR PLAYING WITH ME.
LET'S PLAY TOGETHER AGAIN.

00:27:34.052 --> 00:27:36.254
- You're home.
- Hi, Mom.

00:27:39.791 --> 00:27:41.426
How was school?

00:27:43.294 --> 00:27:46.064
I was ignored. By everyone.

00:27:51.936 --> 00:27:53.104
I'm sorry, Tsubasa.

00:27:55.240 --> 00:27:56.341
I'm sorry.

00:28:00.011 --> 00:28:03.281
I'll tell you
what happened truthfully.

00:28:11.523 --> 00:28:13.024
I'm fine, so

00:28:14.059 --> 00:28:15.460
you don't have to worry.

00:28:20.699 --> 00:28:23.301
I just want you to be happy.

00:28:24.569 --> 00:28:27.739
If you can laugh,
then it's fine by me.

00:28:30.375 --> 00:28:34.145
I'm on your side whatever happens.

00:28:42.554 --> 00:28:44.155
Thank you, Tsubasa.

00:28:53.364 --> 00:28:57.102
SHE'S GOING OUT WITH THE SON
OF HER EX'S MISTRESS. WHAT A MESS.

00:28:59.070 --> 00:29:00.905
The culprit is not my mom.

00:29:02.574 --> 00:29:04.843
Mr. Taguchi doesn't know
where my mom works

00:29:05.810 --> 00:29:07.278
so it's not him either.

00:29:09.481 --> 00:29:11.516
It's someone who holds a grudge

00:29:12.751 --> 00:29:14.285
against me, my mom, and Minori.

00:29:15.987 --> 00:29:18.123
What's with this ungrateful attitude?

00:29:27.165 --> 00:29:28.900
It's just as I thought, then.

00:29:31.469 --> 00:29:32.470
Okay.

00:29:33.404 --> 00:29:34.606
I got it.

00:29:36.808 --> 00:29:38.610
Thanks for looking into it.

00:29:39.944 --> 00:29:41.279
I'll call you later.

00:29:54.392 --> 00:29:57.362
Tsubasa, can you wait for me
at Mr. Taguchi's house?

00:29:59.764 --> 00:30:00.832
Okay.

00:30:02.233 --> 00:30:03.401
I have to go.

00:30:04.536 --> 00:30:05.804
See you later.

00:30:15.780 --> 00:30:17.215
I'll end it.

00:30:19.350 --> 00:30:20.685
I have to

00:30:22.153 --> 00:30:23.655
end it all.

00:30:35.967 --> 00:30:37.435
What do you want, Wataru?

00:30:37.502 --> 00:30:39.671
You threatened Minori, didn't you?

00:30:40.238 --> 00:30:42.540
You're mistaken. I didn't do any--

00:30:42.607 --> 00:30:44.776
Was it because
you wanted to start over with her?

00:30:44.843 --> 00:30:47.879
Did you think she'd depend on you
if you intimidated her?

00:30:48.479 --> 00:30:50.248
No, I really didn't.

00:30:50.315 --> 00:30:51.683
Then, what about my mom?

00:30:52.617 --> 00:30:53.985
Pay back for being ditched?

00:30:54.752 --> 00:30:55.854
Riko?

00:30:55.920 --> 00:30:58.423
You're defaming her
on the beauty salon website, right?

00:30:58.489 --> 00:31:02.627
Posting that the owner has a secret
love child with a married man.

00:31:02.694 --> 00:31:06.064
Hold on. A secret love child?
You mean Reika?

00:31:06.898 --> 00:31:07.999
Yeah.

00:31:08.867 --> 00:31:12.103
Nobody else knows this fact
other than you, Yudai.

00:31:14.539 --> 00:31:15.740
Yudai.

00:31:16.407 --> 00:31:18.943
- Is it true?
- Mom.

00:31:20.712 --> 00:31:24.816
Are you still doing something
that cowardly after seven years?

00:31:24.883 --> 00:31:26.651
No! It's not me!

00:31:29.020 --> 00:31:32.123
Are you taking revenge
for losing everything?

00:31:32.190 --> 00:31:35.026
How stupid of you...
Go turn yourself in to the police.

00:31:35.093 --> 00:31:37.295
I'm not going to the police
because I didn't do it!

00:31:37.362 --> 00:31:39.130
- It's okay. Let's go to the police--
- No!

00:31:39.197 --> 00:31:41.666
You're the one who should
turn yourself in.

00:31:46.137 --> 00:31:47.205
Minori.

00:31:50.608 --> 00:31:52.844
The threatening letters.

00:31:55.013 --> 00:31:57.181
The rumors on the internet.

00:31:58.950 --> 00:32:00.084
They were all your doing.

00:32:02.320 --> 00:32:04.188
Right, Hiromi?

00:32:09.594 --> 00:32:10.995
I don't know what you mean.

00:32:12.163 --> 00:32:13.932
It's no use pretending.

00:32:17.135 --> 00:32:18.937
I asked my dad
to request a disclosure

00:32:19.003 --> 00:32:22.640
of sender's information using
Tsukishiro Group's legal advisor.

00:32:24.042 --> 00:32:26.144
All the slander on the internet

00:32:27.845 --> 00:32:31.316
was posted from
your personal computer, Hiromi.

00:32:36.087 --> 00:32:37.188
I don't know.

00:32:45.596 --> 00:32:47.765
I had this checked
for fingerprints, too.

00:32:49.567 --> 00:32:52.770
This threatening letter
has your fingerprints

00:32:52.837 --> 00:32:54.806
all over it.

00:32:55.306 --> 00:32:56.741
That's...

00:32:59.477 --> 00:33:00.979
I'm sorry, Wataru.

00:33:02.113 --> 00:33:05.316
I thought at first
your mom was the culprit.

00:33:06.784 --> 00:33:07.819
But...

00:33:08.619 --> 00:33:10.054
your mom wouldn't

00:33:10.989 --> 00:33:13.725
do anything to degrade you.

00:33:18.563 --> 00:33:21.165
The only person who could do
such a despicable act

00:33:22.734 --> 00:33:26.404
is someone who used her own son
to get her way.

00:33:28.006 --> 00:33:29.941
Nobody else but her.

00:33:33.444 --> 00:33:35.346
It's too late to talk
your way out of it

00:33:37.015 --> 00:33:38.116
Hiromi.

00:33:47.825 --> 00:33:49.527
What goes around comes around, huh?

00:33:52.063 --> 00:33:53.231
All I did

00:33:54.732 --> 00:33:56.834
was give the correct punishment.

00:33:59.404 --> 00:34:00.638
Punishment?

00:34:06.411 --> 00:34:07.879
These seven years

00:34:08.379 --> 00:34:10.081
were a living hell for me.

00:34:10.148 --> 00:34:15.153
EGG GRATIN HALF PRICE

00:34:17.922 --> 00:34:20.892
Hey, Ms. Kisaragi.

00:34:20.958 --> 00:34:23.761
- Yes.
- The numbers are wrong again.

00:34:23.828 --> 00:34:24.862
I'm sorry.

00:34:25.563 --> 00:34:28.833
It seems you know how to scam people,
but you don't know how to calculate.

00:34:29.801 --> 00:34:34.138
I heard you made your son
marry into a wealthy family

00:34:34.205 --> 00:34:36.474
and tried to
con the family out of their money.

00:34:36.541 --> 00:34:38.076
Is that true?

00:34:38.142 --> 00:34:39.911
Isn't that called marriage scam?

00:34:40.511 --> 00:34:42.980
Don't people get arrested for that?

00:34:43.047 --> 00:34:46.584
I'd really rather not
be working with a criminal.

00:35:02.300 --> 00:35:04.335
HANDMADE BY US

00:35:06.771 --> 00:35:09.107
HANDMADE BY US

00:35:09.173 --> 00:35:11.275
Bad rumors spread quickly.

00:35:12.243 --> 00:35:15.012
I didn't last long at any workplace.

00:35:18.883 --> 00:35:21.919
I had no job nor money.

00:35:23.287 --> 00:35:27.024
All I had left
was a life with my son.

00:35:29.894 --> 00:35:32.597
"Why do I have to live like this?"

00:35:33.364 --> 00:35:35.199
That's what I thought everyday.

00:35:35.800 --> 00:35:38.603
If I lose my only treasure...

00:35:41.672 --> 00:35:43.908
Murder would not be enough.

00:35:46.711 --> 00:35:48.646
I thought she was absolutely right.

00:35:49.680 --> 00:35:52.316
Everything I had was taken from me.

00:35:53.117 --> 00:35:55.319
FAMILY CAFE GARDEN

00:35:56.320 --> 00:35:58.189
Murder would not be enough.

00:36:00.124 --> 00:36:02.827
I won't allow her
to walk away with a victory.

00:36:03.528 --> 00:36:05.229
She'll never get away with it.

00:36:05.296 --> 00:36:08.199
THE OWNER IS
IN A ROMANTIC RELATIONSHIP

00:36:08.266 --> 00:36:10.134
WITH YOUNGER TEACHER "M"

00:36:14.839 --> 00:36:17.375
Why did you threaten my mom too?

00:36:21.412 --> 00:36:24.649
I'm the one who let her open
that beauty salon.

00:36:26.184 --> 00:36:29.620
She kept working there
as if nothing had happened.

00:36:29.687 --> 00:36:32.490
Your mom hasn't lost
anything in the end.

00:36:32.557 --> 00:36:34.091
That's why I wrecked it.

00:36:37.361 --> 00:36:38.563
I was going to

00:36:39.297 --> 00:36:42.066
put all the blame on him.

00:36:46.070 --> 00:36:47.104
Yudai.

00:36:50.007 --> 00:36:52.410
It's true you are
the root of the problem.

00:36:54.011 --> 00:36:55.813
If only you didn't have an affair...

00:36:57.615 --> 00:37:03.654
If you'd listened to me and stay
married to her until we got rich...

00:37:03.721 --> 00:37:09.727
without being swayed by a dumb thing
like love and even have a baby...

00:37:10.728 --> 00:37:14.565
then child support
wouldn't be a problem now!

00:37:14.632 --> 00:37:16.067
You idiot!

00:37:21.872 --> 00:37:23.074
But you're his mom.

00:37:25.876 --> 00:37:28.312
I never considered you
my daughter, you know!

00:37:34.452 --> 00:37:35.553
I've just recorded

00:37:37.221 --> 00:37:39.123
everything you said.

00:37:45.196 --> 00:37:46.530
Hiromi.

00:37:49.166 --> 00:37:50.635
It's over, okay?

00:37:56.474 --> 00:37:57.675
Why?

00:38:02.446 --> 00:38:04.515
Why am I the only one
who has to suffer?

00:38:12.056 --> 00:38:13.591
Why?

00:38:32.276 --> 00:38:33.978
I didn't do anything wrong.

00:38:34.045 --> 00:38:36.647
We destroyed

00:38:36.714 --> 00:38:38.082
everyone's lives.

00:38:38.149 --> 00:38:41.852
We hurt the one
who's more precious than my life.
