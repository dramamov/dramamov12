WEBVTT

00:00:03.536 --> 00:00:04.537
Wataru?

00:00:11.244 --> 00:00:15.048
What's going on?
Why are they here together?

00:00:18.284 --> 00:00:19.753
Is he a friend of yours?

00:00:24.724 --> 00:00:25.725
Yes.

00:00:26.993 --> 00:00:28.661
He's the son of a friend

00:00:29.062 --> 00:00:30.830
who was in a club with me in college.

00:00:31.598 --> 00:00:32.599
Right?

00:00:36.636 --> 00:00:37.737
Yes.

00:00:38.304 --> 00:00:41.441
Oh, this is my wife and my son.

00:00:45.045 --> 00:00:46.246
Pleased to meet you.

00:00:47.247 --> 00:00:48.548
I'm Minori, his wife.

00:00:50.717 --> 00:00:52.085
I'm Wataru Miyake.

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:55.755
This is a surprise.
It's been a long time.

00:00:56.723 --> 00:00:58.224
Yes, it's been a while.

00:01:01.828 --> 00:01:03.563
Is your father well?

00:01:05.331 --> 00:01:06.366
Yes.

00:01:06.866 --> 00:01:12.105
This must mean you came for advice
on something you can't ask your dad.

00:01:12.772 --> 00:01:13.840
Yes.

00:01:14.707 --> 00:01:15.809
Kind of.

00:01:17.677 --> 00:01:22.248
Sorry, I want to have a man-to-man
talk in private. Go on home.

00:01:25.185 --> 00:01:26.186
Okay.

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:29.022
Let's go.

00:01:40.533 --> 00:01:41.701
Yes.

00:01:42.802 --> 00:01:45.638
Daddy's friends come over a lot
these days, don't they?

00:01:46.506 --> 00:01:47.740
Friends?

00:01:48.608 --> 00:01:52.812
Yes. A lady stopped by when
we were playing in the park.

00:01:54.814 --> 00:01:55.849
A lady?

00:01:56.382 --> 00:01:59.085
A pretty lady with long hair.

00:01:59.152 --> 00:02:00.787
Are you friends with her too?

00:02:03.423 --> 00:02:04.591
That woman

00:02:05.625 --> 00:02:07.160
met Tsubasa?

00:02:09.062 --> 00:02:10.063
No.

00:02:11.397 --> 00:02:12.932
I don't think I do.

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:15.568
She gave me candy.

00:02:37.123 --> 00:02:38.491
What did you do with it?

00:02:38.558 --> 00:02:39.859
I ate it.

00:02:39.926 --> 00:02:42.495
Why did you eat candy
from a stranger?

00:02:46.132 --> 00:02:47.534
I'm sorry.

00:02:50.904 --> 00:02:52.605
If she harms Tsubasa

00:02:53.706 --> 00:02:54.774
I'll kill her.

00:02:57.177 --> 00:03:00.580
What are you doing? I told you
not to come near this house.

00:03:01.247 --> 00:03:03.683
I didn't think
I would bump into your wife.

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:05.885
Why didn't you text me?

00:03:06.452 --> 00:03:08.454
You know better than to do this.

00:03:13.493 --> 00:03:14.494
Your wife...

00:03:16.229 --> 00:03:17.630
She's beautiful.

00:03:18.131 --> 00:03:20.266
What? What are you saying
all of a sudden?

00:03:21.234 --> 00:03:23.870
Mom and your wife
are different types, I noticed.

00:03:25.772 --> 00:03:27.373
Never mind that.

00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:30.543
What's so important for you
to have come all the way here?

00:03:34.681 --> 00:03:35.682
Well...

00:03:36.549 --> 00:03:38.718
I've got to fake it somehow.

00:03:39.419 --> 00:03:41.554
I can never let Minori find out

00:03:42.188 --> 00:03:45.458
that I have another family.

00:04:31.771 --> 00:04:36.809
UNTIL I DESTROYED
MY HUSBAND'S OTHER FAMILY

00:04:37.143 --> 00:04:39.012
- Squeeze.
- Squeeze.

00:04:40.013 --> 00:04:41.347
Finished!

00:04:41.414 --> 00:04:43.983
Wow, you drew such a cute cat!

00:04:44.050 --> 00:04:45.251
Next one's Daddy's.

00:04:45.318 --> 00:04:47.487
You should draw
a heart for him, Mommy.

00:04:47.553 --> 00:04:48.621
Me?

00:04:48.688 --> 00:04:50.757
Daddy drew one
for you before, remember?

00:04:55.028 --> 00:04:56.029
There.

00:04:56.429 --> 00:04:59.132
I'm done.
Now it's your turn to draw a heart.

00:05:00.033 --> 00:05:02.402
- What?
- A heart.

00:05:06.205 --> 00:05:07.674
Okay.

00:05:34.600 --> 00:05:36.269
That's a lot of ketchup.

00:05:37.303 --> 00:05:39.772
Sorry. I squeezed a little too much.

00:05:41.674 --> 00:05:44.944
Mommy drew a heart for you, Daddy.

00:05:45.011 --> 00:05:46.779
It just didn't work out today.

00:05:47.547 --> 00:05:48.748
Oh, okay.

00:05:50.249 --> 00:05:51.417
That's nice of you.

00:05:52.518 --> 00:05:53.753
Thank you for the meal.

00:05:55.221 --> 00:05:57.256
How can he keep smiling?

00:05:58.491 --> 00:06:00.693
What did Wataru come here to say?

00:06:02.095 --> 00:06:03.162
Did he come

00:06:03.629 --> 00:06:05.965
to tell Yudai about me?

00:06:06.733 --> 00:06:08.000
That boy who came...

00:06:08.768 --> 00:06:10.103
What was his name? Miyake?

00:06:11.204 --> 00:06:14.307
What was such an emergency
that he had to come and see you?

00:06:15.041 --> 00:06:16.109
Well, he...

00:06:17.543 --> 00:06:18.745
Well...

00:06:20.012 --> 00:06:22.782
he had questions
about which college to go to.

00:06:23.583 --> 00:06:27.353
He has a college he wants to go to
but his parents are against it.

00:06:28.221 --> 00:06:29.489
I see.

00:06:30.990 --> 00:06:33.126
Which college does he want to go to?

00:06:33.192 --> 00:06:34.193
What?

00:06:34.494 --> 00:06:37.397
What was it... Oh, an art university.

00:06:38.364 --> 00:06:40.233
He says he likes art.

00:06:40.700 --> 00:06:42.635
Keiho, the Faculty of Education.

00:06:48.474 --> 00:06:49.976
Mommy, I want milk.

00:06:51.978 --> 00:06:53.312
Just a second.

00:07:00.753 --> 00:07:03.656
Sorry, Tsubasa, we're out of milk.

00:07:03.723 --> 00:07:06.025
But I want to drink milk.

00:07:06.759 --> 00:07:09.996
Okay, then I'll go buy some milk.

00:07:10.062 --> 00:07:11.931
- Watch Tsubasa for me.
- Sure.

00:07:21.407 --> 00:07:22.608
Wataru.

00:07:23.409 --> 00:07:24.510
Ms. Kume.

00:07:26.245 --> 00:07:27.280
I...

00:07:36.189 --> 00:07:38.524
Why did you come to our house?

00:07:42.495 --> 00:07:44.297
Is it because I used you?

00:07:46.699 --> 00:07:48.134
Did you come to reveal everything?

00:07:48.768 --> 00:07:49.869
That's not it.

00:07:52.205 --> 00:07:53.539
I wanted to see you.

00:07:58.911 --> 00:07:59.946
I...

00:08:01.681 --> 00:08:03.649
I've been thinking
since the last time we met

00:08:05.184 --> 00:08:06.686
that day we went to the sea.

00:08:08.387 --> 00:08:09.489
Ms. Kume.

00:08:11.390 --> 00:08:12.992
Minori, you said to me that day...

00:08:14.894 --> 00:08:17.463
You are plunging
the family of your lover into hell

00:08:17.964 --> 00:08:18.998
You made me think about

00:08:21.501 --> 00:08:23.769
why I was okay with infidelity.

00:08:26.005 --> 00:08:27.039
I realized...

00:08:29.275 --> 00:08:31.477
I was running away from it
this whole time.

00:08:34.280 --> 00:08:36.682
If Mom was happy,
then it was fine for me too.

00:08:39.619 --> 00:08:40.720
So

00:08:41.888 --> 00:08:44.757
I was just looking away
from the reality of their affair.

00:08:44.824 --> 00:08:47.193
I was trying not to think about it.

00:08:52.832 --> 00:08:53.866
That's why

00:08:55.268 --> 00:08:57.403
I wanted to see you in person
and apologize to you.

00:08:59.305 --> 00:09:01.340
I know my apology
won't solve anything.

00:09:05.044 --> 00:09:07.013
It's not for you to apologize.

00:09:09.348 --> 00:09:10.483
But...

00:09:11.817 --> 00:09:14.220
it was also my fault
it got awkward just now.

00:09:21.260 --> 00:09:22.361
Tell me.

00:09:25.932 --> 00:09:27.934
What did you talk about
with Yudai just now?

00:09:30.636 --> 00:09:33.773
I asked him if he was serious
about getting married to Mom.

00:09:37.410 --> 00:09:38.578
And?

00:09:40.546 --> 00:09:41.948
Yudai said...

00:09:43.282 --> 00:09:45.785
You don't have to worry about it.

00:09:46.319 --> 00:09:47.353
But

00:09:47.920 --> 00:09:50.523
didn't you marry your wife
because you loved her?

00:09:51.123 --> 00:09:53.225
- Then why--
- The one I love is...

00:09:55.194 --> 00:09:57.263
Your mother is the only one I love.

00:10:01.233 --> 00:10:02.768
I already knew the answer, but...

00:10:13.646 --> 00:10:14.780
I'm sorry.

00:10:17.450 --> 00:10:18.618
But

00:10:19.518 --> 00:10:21.220
I don't want to lie anymore.

00:10:25.591 --> 00:10:26.792
Minori.

00:10:38.537 --> 00:10:40.006
Hey, Wataru.

00:10:41.073 --> 00:10:42.942
Are you on my side?

00:10:44.577 --> 00:10:45.678
What?

00:10:46.345 --> 00:10:48.614
Would you do anything I say?

00:10:51.317 --> 00:10:52.618
Anything?

00:10:53.819 --> 00:10:54.920
Yes.

00:10:55.821 --> 00:10:57.089
Anything.

00:11:12.204 --> 00:11:13.506
I'm home.

00:11:13.906 --> 00:11:16.609
Tsubasa, I got milk.

00:11:16.676 --> 00:11:18.344
What is going on?

00:11:29.989 --> 00:11:31.123
Yes, and?

00:11:32.692 --> 00:11:33.726
Okay.

00:11:36.295 --> 00:11:38.698
I already know that.

00:11:38.764 --> 00:11:41.701
But if we're found out,
everything will be in vain.

00:11:41.767 --> 00:11:43.803
How long do we have to wait
for the money?

00:11:45.337 --> 00:11:47.273
We don't have much time.

00:11:47.339 --> 00:11:49.575
My marriage to Minori
would become pointless!

00:11:59.852 --> 00:12:01.120
KANON MUTO

00:12:01.187 --> 00:12:02.855
COME TO THE CRAM SCHOOL RIGHT NOW!

00:12:02.922 --> 00:12:04.256
MOM, MISSED CALL

00:12:25.978 --> 00:12:30.449
- It's hot, isn't it?
- This never happened before.

00:12:30.516 --> 00:12:34.120
It's fine. The kids are in their
sensitive years.

00:12:34.186 --> 00:12:36.822
He's probably
letting off steam somewhere.

00:12:37.056 --> 00:12:38.457
I'm so sorry.

00:12:39.058 --> 00:12:41.427
You don't have to worry, Ms. Miyake.

00:12:42.128 --> 00:12:44.897
Wataru is doing very well recently.

00:12:45.331 --> 00:12:48.134
-Really?
-Look at this.

00:12:48.200 --> 00:12:49.835
It's his study plan sheet.

00:12:51.771 --> 00:12:52.805
Mom.

00:12:53.139 --> 00:12:55.574
Wataru. Where were you?

00:12:56.075 --> 00:12:58.177
I just had to go get
something I left at school.

00:12:58.978 --> 00:13:01.847
You know you should have
contacted your teacher.

00:13:03.816 --> 00:13:05.384
- I'm sorry.
- It's all right.

00:13:06.318 --> 00:13:09.622
But don't worry your mother so much.

00:13:14.560 --> 00:13:15.561
Sorry.

00:13:17.263 --> 00:13:20.266
- Wataru?
- I'll come home after studying.

00:13:21.333 --> 00:13:24.203
- You can go home without me.
- Hey, Wataru.

00:13:28.174 --> 00:13:31.043
I'm really sorry
for all this trouble.

00:13:31.110 --> 00:13:32.478
No worries. Please take a look.

00:13:38.584 --> 00:13:40.152
Keiho University?

00:13:40.586 --> 00:13:43.222
His scores for English
are improving rapidly

00:13:43.923 --> 00:13:46.892
so if he keeps it up, it's not
impossible for him to be admitted.

00:13:49.428 --> 00:13:51.163
Is that so?

00:13:53.632 --> 00:13:55.000
I didn't know.

00:13:55.067 --> 00:13:57.002
FIRST CHOICE: KEIHO UNIVERSITY
TUTOR: KUME

00:13:59.605 --> 00:14:00.873
Were you okay?

00:14:03.108 --> 00:14:05.211
Yes.

00:14:08.547 --> 00:14:10.983
- Give me.
- What?

00:14:12.184 --> 00:14:13.652
I want that.

00:14:15.721 --> 00:14:17.623
What? This?

00:14:18.424 --> 00:14:20.893
-Why?
-You owe me, don't you?

00:14:21.861 --> 00:14:22.895
Here.

00:14:34.373 --> 00:14:35.407
Thank you.

00:14:38.878 --> 00:14:40.546
Where were you really?

00:14:43.883 --> 00:14:45.951
I bet you went to see Ms. Kume.

00:14:49.288 --> 00:14:53.025
- I seriously think you shouldn't.
- It's nothing like that.

00:14:53.092 --> 00:14:54.793
What's it to you?

00:15:05.437 --> 00:15:07.706
My marriage to Minori
would become pointless!

00:15:09.074 --> 00:15:10.709
Why did he say
there wasn't much time?

00:15:12.478 --> 00:15:14.046
Wait for what money?

00:15:16.148 --> 00:15:18.817
Why would marrying me be pointless?

00:15:22.488 --> 00:15:23.589
Hey.

00:15:24.390 --> 00:15:25.491
Yes?

00:15:26.458 --> 00:15:28.394
Who were you talking to on the phone?

00:15:30.062 --> 00:15:31.063
What?

00:15:33.332 --> 00:15:34.333
Well...

00:15:35.501 --> 00:15:36.502
You were

00:15:37.403 --> 00:15:39.004
raising your voice, so...

00:15:40.105 --> 00:15:41.206
I see.

00:15:42.374 --> 00:15:44.009
It was about work.

00:15:44.910 --> 00:15:46.812
Kusunoki messed up again.

00:15:49.415 --> 00:15:50.582
I see.

00:15:51.917 --> 00:15:53.786
It must be hard working late.

00:15:54.286 --> 00:15:55.554
It is.

00:15:57.623 --> 00:15:59.224
I'm going to take a bath.

00:16:11.770 --> 00:16:13.105
Can I come in for a second?

00:16:14.239 --> 00:16:15.274
What?

00:16:19.712 --> 00:16:20.746
Guess what?

00:16:21.347 --> 00:16:26.051
Your teacher said getting into Keiho
is possible if you work hard.

00:16:27.686 --> 00:16:30.189
- I was pleasantly surprised.
- Mom.

00:16:31.323 --> 00:16:32.324
Yes?

00:16:34.393 --> 00:16:35.461
Do you...

00:16:38.564 --> 00:16:41.033
really believe
you could get married to Yudai?

00:16:43.702 --> 00:16:45.204
Why all of a sudden?

00:16:47.539 --> 00:16:48.574
You know...

00:16:50.342 --> 00:16:52.544
he has his real family over there.

00:16:56.715 --> 00:16:59.218
Why are you bringing
something like that up now?

00:17:02.988 --> 00:17:05.224
I believe in Yudai.

00:17:06.992 --> 00:17:08.060
I see.

00:17:11.530 --> 00:17:12.898
You're acting strange lately.

00:17:13.732 --> 00:17:14.867
Did something happen?

00:17:15.334 --> 00:17:16.468
Not really.

00:17:22.307 --> 00:17:23.409
Are you done?

00:17:24.443 --> 00:17:25.611
I have to study.

00:17:27.246 --> 00:17:28.447
Oh. Okay.

00:17:29.882 --> 00:17:30.983
Try your best.

00:17:46.632 --> 00:17:49.802
It's only a matter of time
before Minori finds out.

00:17:51.036 --> 00:17:52.104
Wataru?

00:17:52.671 --> 00:17:54.506
Who were you talking to on the phone?

00:17:54.573 --> 00:17:56.241
I've got to do something.

00:18:03.982 --> 00:18:06.085
Hey, are you free on Friday?

00:18:06.718 --> 00:18:07.886
Friday?

00:18:07.953 --> 00:18:09.455
Isn't it our first date anniversary?

00:18:10.222 --> 00:18:13.826
I'll take off work,
so how about we eat out together?

00:18:16.095 --> 00:18:18.163
What's gotten into him?

00:18:22.101 --> 00:18:23.735
Wow. You remembered?

00:18:24.303 --> 00:18:26.038
Of course.

00:18:28.807 --> 00:18:30.109
I'm glad you did.

00:18:31.176 --> 00:18:33.245
We can let my mother babysit Tsubasa

00:18:33.312 --> 00:18:35.214
and spend some time alone together.

00:18:35.981 --> 00:18:37.516
Do you have a restaurant in mind?

00:18:41.253 --> 00:18:44.022
I'd go anywhere you choose.

00:18:44.656 --> 00:18:47.426
Okay, then I'll search for one.

00:18:48.861 --> 00:18:50.062
I can't wait.

00:18:58.437 --> 00:19:00.672
It sure is suspicious.

00:19:01.974 --> 00:19:03.108
Right?

00:19:03.742 --> 00:19:07.646
Wataru's visit made him nervous.
He's trying to get on my good side.

00:19:07.713 --> 00:19:08.747
Yes.

00:19:09.948 --> 00:19:12.317
And that phone call is concerning.

00:19:13.051 --> 00:19:16.655
Not having much time could be
about the baby being born.

00:19:17.322 --> 00:19:21.693
But marriage to you being pointless?
What is he plotting?

00:19:25.264 --> 00:19:27.366
Fancy!

00:19:27.432 --> 00:19:30.636
- A date with your wife?
- You've got to once in a while.

00:19:31.236 --> 00:19:35.340
I've never eaten anywhere like this.
You're loaded.

00:19:35.407 --> 00:19:39.178
It's just like our Chief
to take good care of his wife.

00:19:39.244 --> 00:19:40.812
That's why he's married.

00:19:41.647 --> 00:19:45.517
That looks like a nice place. I want
to go there with you someday.

00:19:46.518 --> 00:19:47.519
What?

00:19:48.220 --> 00:19:50.255
I've never been
to a restaurant like this.

00:19:51.557 --> 00:19:54.026
Right. Someday.

00:19:54.493 --> 00:19:56.929
Really? All right!

00:19:58.530 --> 00:20:00.132
It went that way.

00:20:00.199 --> 00:20:03.669
I'm sorry to make you come by
after work when you're tired.

00:20:03.735 --> 00:20:06.471
No, I don't mind. What do you want?

00:20:06.538 --> 00:20:11.109
I made a lot of chikuwa salad that
Tsubasa likes, so take some home.

00:20:11.176 --> 00:20:14.012
You can still eat it tomorrow
if you store it in the fridge.

00:20:14.079 --> 00:20:15.948
You called me for this?

00:20:16.014 --> 00:20:17.349
Don't be silly.

00:20:17.416 --> 00:20:18.884
Just wait a second.

00:20:28.427 --> 00:20:29.428
Sorry.

00:20:42.874 --> 00:20:44.376
Yudai.

00:20:44.443 --> 00:20:45.544
Take this.

00:20:47.546 --> 00:20:49.414
This is the main reason I called you.

00:20:50.115 --> 00:20:51.250
What is it?

00:20:52.884 --> 00:20:54.253
This is what's in it.

00:20:57.022 --> 00:20:58.090
Expensive!

00:20:58.156 --> 00:21:00.559
- It's an anniversary gift for her.
- What?

00:21:01.660 --> 00:21:04.229
You have to take
special care of Minori.

00:21:04.963 --> 00:21:07.766
Only then we can be happy, right?

00:21:13.438 --> 00:21:14.673
I know.

00:21:18.176 --> 00:21:19.611
Do you remember

00:21:20.445 --> 00:21:22.414
our first date anniversary?

00:21:22.481 --> 00:21:27.219
Of course I do. You wanted
to go to Disneyland so badly.

00:21:28.120 --> 00:21:33.425
My dream was to take a picture
with you wearing Mickey Mouse ears.

00:21:33.492 --> 00:21:35.594
I took so many part-time jobs
to pay for it.

00:21:36.228 --> 00:21:41.833
We ate churros for the first time
that day, remember?

00:21:41.900 --> 00:21:43.335
What? What's that?

00:21:43.402 --> 00:21:46.705
They're those long,
stick-like things that have ridges--

00:21:46.772 --> 00:21:49.574
- Those doughnuts.
- Yes. That's it.

00:21:53.478 --> 00:21:56.381
That was 17 years ago...

00:21:59.618 --> 00:22:00.752
Does that feel long ago?

00:22:02.721 --> 00:22:03.989
Or does it feel recent?

00:22:08.560 --> 00:22:10.295
I don't know.

00:22:13.865 --> 00:22:16.034
My marriage to Minori
would become pointless!

00:22:26.378 --> 00:22:27.412
This bracelet.

00:22:29.581 --> 00:22:31.483
This was what started it all.

00:22:34.353 --> 00:22:35.721
Tonight

00:22:37.255 --> 00:22:39.524
let's start by making a toast
to our first encounter.

00:22:40.258 --> 00:22:41.259
Yes.

00:22:43.795 --> 00:22:44.830
Cheers.

00:22:45.397 --> 00:22:46.665
Cheers.

00:23:05.584 --> 00:23:06.585
Hey.

00:23:10.789 --> 00:23:12.958
I've been wanting to ask you.

00:23:18.196 --> 00:23:20.065
How do you feel about me?

00:23:22.234 --> 00:23:23.869
Why do you ask?

00:23:32.611 --> 00:23:34.413
We've had 17 years together.

00:23:37.716 --> 00:23:39.017
During this time...

00:23:41.119 --> 00:23:42.387
have you really

00:23:44.156 --> 00:23:45.257
loved me?

00:23:58.737 --> 00:23:59.771
I...

00:24:16.988 --> 00:24:18.156
Sorry.

00:24:22.227 --> 00:24:23.495
Just a minute.

00:24:26.264 --> 00:24:27.699
Hello?

00:24:30.235 --> 00:24:31.236
Yes.

00:24:33.672 --> 00:24:34.673
What?

00:24:37.342 --> 00:24:38.944
I see. I'll be right there.

00:24:39.578 --> 00:24:42.914
- What's the matter?
- Grandpa got taken to the hospital.

00:24:42.981 --> 00:24:44.783
- What?
- I have to go.

00:24:44.850 --> 00:24:46.218
I'll go too.

00:24:46.284 --> 00:24:48.019
I need you to go pick up Tsubasa.

00:25:08.073 --> 00:25:10.542
Hello? It's me.

00:25:25.156 --> 00:25:26.324
Grandpa.

00:25:28.994 --> 00:25:30.629
The cancer is spreading?

00:25:31.396 --> 00:25:34.165
Unfortunately, it's advanced further.

00:25:35.400 --> 00:25:38.837
With it spreading to this level,
treatment by surgery is difficult.

00:25:43.742 --> 00:25:45.977
I didn't realize it at all.

00:25:47.746 --> 00:25:48.914
I'm sorry.

00:25:56.021 --> 00:25:57.088
Grandpa.

00:26:02.594 --> 00:26:03.795
Minori, it's you.

00:26:05.530 --> 00:26:06.765
You must have been surprised.

00:26:07.532 --> 00:26:08.533
Sorry.

00:26:10.702 --> 00:26:13.405
Have you been suffering
for a long time?

00:26:14.573 --> 00:26:16.641
Why didn't you tell me?

00:26:17.709 --> 00:26:20.612
I didn't want to worry you.

00:26:26.518 --> 00:26:28.420
Were you doing
something special today?

00:26:33.058 --> 00:26:35.560
It was my anniversary with Yudai.

00:26:36.328 --> 00:26:37.462
I see.

00:26:38.597 --> 00:26:39.831
I feel bad for ruining it.

00:26:40.765 --> 00:26:41.800
It's okay.

00:26:42.801 --> 00:26:45.503
I seems I don't have long to live.

00:26:50.475 --> 00:26:51.743
Minori.

00:26:54.379 --> 00:26:56.648
There's something I want to tell you
before I die.

00:26:57.616 --> 00:26:59.017
Stop it.

00:26:59.818 --> 00:27:01.586
Don't say something like that.

00:27:03.288 --> 00:27:04.756
That bracelet...

00:27:06.891 --> 00:27:08.860
- This?
- Yes.

00:27:09.828 --> 00:27:11.696
Do you know where it's from?

00:27:12.731 --> 00:27:13.798
Where it's from?

00:27:14.332 --> 00:27:15.934
Tsukishiro Jewelry, right?

00:27:16.835 --> 00:27:17.836
Yes.

00:27:19.771 --> 00:27:20.939
That was given

00:27:22.374 --> 00:27:24.142
by Susumu Tsukishiro

00:27:25.176 --> 00:27:26.978
to Miyuki.

00:27:27.812 --> 00:27:31.383
Susumu Tsukishiro...

00:27:32.250 --> 00:27:35.153
He's the chairman
of Tsukishiro Group.

00:27:49.300 --> 00:27:50.335
This man?

00:27:50.402 --> 00:27:51.403
SUSUMU TSUKISHIRO

00:27:53.672 --> 00:27:54.773
Yes.

00:27:58.109 --> 00:28:01.279
Why did this prominent man
give this to Mom?

00:28:06.351 --> 00:28:07.719
That man...

00:28:10.355 --> 00:28:11.990
is your father.

00:28:19.164 --> 00:28:22.233
Forgive me for not telling you
until now.

00:28:27.539 --> 00:28:28.606
Really?

00:28:32.844 --> 00:28:33.978
Why?

00:28:35.280 --> 00:28:37.248
Why didn't you tell me?

00:28:39.117 --> 00:28:40.351
Minori.

00:28:42.320 --> 00:28:44.122
You probably were aware of

00:28:45.256 --> 00:28:47.158
why you didn't have a father.

00:28:48.426 --> 00:28:51.563
Karma got her for having an affair.

00:28:54.599 --> 00:28:56.201
What Miyuki did

00:28:57.035 --> 00:28:59.003
was unacceptable.

00:29:00.672 --> 00:29:01.973
But the same can be said

00:29:02.774 --> 00:29:04.676
about Susumu Tsukishirio.

00:29:08.246 --> 00:29:09.280
In spite of that

00:29:11.983 --> 00:29:14.352
the moment he knew
that Miyuki was pregnant

00:29:15.420 --> 00:29:16.554
he abruptly

00:29:17.088 --> 00:29:19.057
left Miyuki.

00:29:24.562 --> 00:29:25.764
But...

00:29:28.099 --> 00:29:30.869
after Miyuki died in an accident

00:29:31.636 --> 00:29:34.606
he came to see me.

00:29:37.442 --> 00:29:38.576
On the day

00:29:40.445 --> 00:29:42.113
of the accident

00:29:44.048 --> 00:29:45.884
he and Miyuki saw each other.

00:29:47.318 --> 00:29:49.053
What happened, Mom?

00:29:49.120 --> 00:29:50.488
You look pretty today.

00:29:53.391 --> 00:29:54.526
So that's why.

00:29:56.161 --> 00:29:57.228
He tried

00:29:58.930 --> 00:30:02.567
to settle everything with money.

00:30:04.435 --> 00:30:05.703
I couldn't forgive him.

00:30:09.140 --> 00:30:10.575
That kind of man...

00:30:13.678 --> 00:30:15.847
wasn't worthy of being called
a father.

00:30:19.717 --> 00:30:21.085
That's why I never told you

00:30:21.619 --> 00:30:25.423
the true identity of your father.

00:30:28.226 --> 00:30:29.561
I'm sorry.

00:30:33.832 --> 00:30:34.899
Minori.

00:30:38.002 --> 00:30:39.838
Can you hand me my bag?

00:31:00.692 --> 00:31:02.660
There's a passbook inside.

00:31:11.669 --> 00:31:12.770
That passbook

00:31:13.805 --> 00:31:15.173
is what he gave me

00:31:15.874 --> 00:31:18.943
as child support for you, Minori.

00:31:36.594 --> 00:31:37.695
So much...

00:31:40.098 --> 00:31:42.066
He also gave me stocks.

00:31:45.136 --> 00:31:46.404
I have it arranged

00:31:48.139 --> 00:31:50.875
so that when I die,
you will get all of them.

00:31:56.214 --> 00:31:58.383
Don't talk about dying.

00:32:00.585 --> 00:32:02.654
What am I going to do

00:32:03.321 --> 00:32:05.456
without you, Grandpa?

00:32:06.491 --> 00:32:07.825
You have your

00:32:08.426 --> 00:32:10.695
beloved family, don't you, Minori?

00:32:13.698 --> 00:32:15.166
You should live happily

00:32:16.701 --> 00:32:17.902
with Yudai

00:32:20.104 --> 00:32:21.539
and Tsubasa.

00:32:25.143 --> 00:32:26.411
I can't let my grandpa

00:32:28.279 --> 00:32:30.815
worry about me.

00:32:32.050 --> 00:32:33.051
Yes.

00:32:35.820 --> 00:32:36.955
I will.

00:33:00.979 --> 00:33:02.613
Susumu Tsukishiro left my mother

00:33:03.781 --> 00:33:06.050
as soon as he found out

00:33:07.051 --> 00:33:08.619
my mother was pregnant.

00:33:10.388 --> 00:33:11.389
On the other hand

00:33:12.490 --> 00:33:13.624
Yudai said....

00:33:15.493 --> 00:33:18.129
He says he can't wait
to meet the baby.

00:33:23.134 --> 00:33:24.268
Why?

00:33:27.772 --> 00:33:29.007
Grandpa

00:33:30.808 --> 00:33:32.810
no matter how much money you give me

00:33:34.512 --> 00:33:37.048
my happy home is no more...

00:33:38.049 --> 00:33:40.451
How long do we have to wait
for the money?

00:33:44.355 --> 00:33:45.690
TSUKISHIRO ANNOUNCES
THEIR FIRST EUROPEAN STORE

00:33:59.303 --> 00:34:00.405
Could it be...

00:34:05.376 --> 00:34:06.444
But

00:34:07.512 --> 00:34:09.580
how would Yudai know about

00:34:10.982 --> 00:34:12.650
a secret that's unknown to me?

00:34:25.897 --> 00:34:27.131
Coming.

00:34:29.300 --> 00:34:31.536
I'm so sorry I'm late.

00:34:31.602 --> 00:34:33.538
Haven't you heard from Yudai?

00:34:34.072 --> 00:34:36.774
He took Tsubasa home a while ago.

00:34:39.243 --> 00:34:40.378
I forgot.

00:34:40.978 --> 00:34:44.816
I'm the one who told him to,
but I got confused.

00:34:44.882 --> 00:34:46.551
Don't worry, it can't be helped.

00:34:47.218 --> 00:34:49.587
So, how is your grandfather doing?

00:34:53.024 --> 00:34:54.659
The cancer is spreading?

00:34:55.960 --> 00:34:58.329
They can only delay the spread
with medication.

00:34:59.363 --> 00:35:00.498
Nothing else they can do.

00:35:01.065 --> 00:35:05.103
But with the recent advancements
in medicine

00:35:07.638 --> 00:35:09.340
I'm sure he'll be all right.

00:35:11.042 --> 00:35:12.410
Minori.

00:35:13.878 --> 00:35:15.379
Try to stay strong.

00:35:18.649 --> 00:35:20.218
Thank you.

00:35:23.387 --> 00:35:26.924
Yudai told me
you didn't have time to eat.

00:35:27.592 --> 00:35:29.861
Oh. I guess so.

00:35:30.862 --> 00:35:33.898
I wish I had some sweets
in the house.

00:35:33.965 --> 00:35:37.268
I know, I'll go get some
at the convenience store.

00:35:37.668 --> 00:35:40.471
- It'll only be a minute.
- Don't worry about it.

00:35:41.305 --> 00:35:42.807
Okay. What?

00:35:43.374 --> 00:35:45.176
Where did I put my wallet?

00:35:45.676 --> 00:35:48.679
I keep putting it somewhere
but I forget where.

00:35:52.583 --> 00:35:53.718
YUDAI KISARAGI

00:35:53.784 --> 00:35:55.186
YOU MUST HAVE HEARD FROM MINORI.

00:35:55.253 --> 00:35:56.387
WHEN I RECEIVE THE MONEY,
WE SHOULD GET MOVING.

00:36:01.259 --> 00:36:02.360
Minori.

00:36:03.728 --> 00:36:04.762
Yes.

00:36:05.129 --> 00:36:06.564
I'll be right back.

00:36:09.200 --> 00:36:11.469
- Be careful.
- I will.

00:36:40.498 --> 00:36:43.034
TALK

00:36:44.335 --> 00:36:45.436
Talk.

00:36:47.438 --> 00:36:48.873
KISARAGI NEW FAMILY (3)

00:36:52.443 --> 00:36:53.477
Kisaragi

00:36:55.313 --> 00:36:56.314
New family.

00:36:56.380 --> 00:36:57.448
KISARAGI NEW FAMILY (3)

00:36:58.883 --> 00:36:59.984
YUDAI KISARAGI:
YOU MUST HAVE HEARD FROM MINORI.

00:37:00.051 --> 00:37:01.052
WHEN I RECEIVE THE MONEY,
WE SHOULD GET MOVING.

00:37:05.056 --> 00:37:07.425
IT SOUNDED BAD.
MAYBE HE ONLY HAS A FEW MONTHS.

00:37:17.635 --> 00:37:19.303
THANK YOU. I HOPE WE CAN
LIVE TOGETHER AS A NEW FAMILY SOON.

00:37:25.309 --> 00:37:26.377
GOOD NIGHT. THANK YOU AS ALWAYS.

00:37:26.444 --> 00:37:27.578
I'LL SEND YOU PHOTOS FROM OUR
DINNER TOGETHER THE OTHER DAY.

00:37:29.680 --> 00:37:32.416
KISARAGI NEW FAMILY (3)

00:37:50.501 --> 00:37:54.238
How can even my mother-in-law
betray me?

00:37:56.173 --> 00:37:59.310
How can they be hoping to make
a new family?

00:38:14.258 --> 00:38:15.293
I won't let them.

00:38:18.195 --> 00:38:19.463
I can't let them.

00:38:26.604 --> 00:38:27.638
I won't let them.

00:38:31.309 --> 00:38:34.712
It's our family's big project.

00:38:34.779 --> 00:38:38.449
They were all involved in a plot
to steal your assets?

00:38:38.516 --> 00:38:40.151
You'll catch a cold like that.

00:38:40.217 --> 00:38:41.852
I'm on your side, Minori.
