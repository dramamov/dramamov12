WEBVTT

00:00:13.446 --> 00:00:14.447
Excuse me.

00:00:14.514 --> 00:00:16.249
Did the girl who's always playing
that game show up today?

00:00:16.850 --> 00:00:19.586
– I haven't seen her yet today.
– Thank you.

00:00:21.421 --> 00:00:23.456
Does Tominaga always come here?

00:00:23.556 --> 00:00:25.425
This is the only place
I could think of.

00:00:29.195 --> 00:00:31.598
– The girl was messed up.
– Was she drunk?

00:00:31.931 --> 00:00:33.767
Sure, she was even
in her school uniform.

00:00:52.152 --> 00:00:54.254
You managed to send an SOS.

00:00:55.388 --> 00:00:56.456
You did great.

00:01:09.502 --> 00:01:12.605
My place is nearby.
Let's go there for now.

00:01:13.306 --> 00:01:15.208
Tominaga, think you can make it?

00:01:15.642 --> 00:01:18.311
Okay, ready, one, two! All right.

00:01:34.527 --> 00:01:38.598
Pretty hilarious to see
all three of us wearing my clothes.

00:01:43.002 --> 00:01:44.003
What?

00:01:46.873 --> 00:01:47.874
Sorry.

00:01:49.309 --> 00:01:50.710
If you want to talk, I'll listen.

00:01:51.411 --> 00:01:53.480
And if you don't want to,
it's okay not to talk about it.

00:01:54.414 --> 00:01:56.282
If it's better to wait,
then I'll wait.

00:01:58.618 --> 00:02:04.691
You already know, don't you, Okami?

00:02:07.193 --> 00:02:08.928
I kind of suspected it.

00:02:10.597 --> 00:02:13.133
This is about your precious family.

00:02:18.471 --> 00:02:24.410
MR. MIKAMI'S CLASSROOM

00:02:25.445 --> 00:02:30.083
I know that your younger brother
has a disability.

00:02:31.417 --> 00:02:35.088
He has a congenital condition
with his spine and can't walk.

00:02:35.889 --> 00:02:38.091
He also has a mild
intellectual disability.

00:02:38.358 --> 00:02:41.394
I also heard your parents are
completely devoted to his care.

00:02:44.097 --> 00:02:49.769
What concerned me was that
despite those circumstances

00:02:50.103 --> 00:02:52.205
you were always killing time
at the game arcade.

00:02:53.506 --> 00:02:54.507
And yet...

00:02:55.642 --> 00:02:57.610
Seeing how positive you always were

00:02:58.978 --> 00:03:01.548
I convinced myself
that couldn't be the case.

00:03:02.749 --> 00:03:08.421
Is Detective Okami's deduction
right, Tominaga?

00:03:15.361 --> 00:03:16.529
My brother...

00:03:20.533 --> 00:03:22.835
He gets unstable when I'm around.

00:03:24.370 --> 00:03:27.840
He has this rule where

00:03:27.941 --> 00:03:30.376
he goes into his room
at 8 p.m. every night.

00:03:31.311 --> 00:03:35.882
So I make sure to
come home after that time.

00:03:37.217 --> 00:03:38.718
That's tough.

00:03:40.119 --> 00:03:41.321
I still remember...

00:03:44.023 --> 00:03:45.458
Ryu...

00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:49.062
That's my brother's name.

00:03:51.531 --> 00:03:54.133
I remember the day
he stopped liking me.

00:03:57.103 --> 00:04:01.808
You know those relatives
who mean well

00:04:03.142 --> 00:04:05.979
but always say the wrong things?

00:04:08.348 --> 00:04:09.549
One of them told him

00:04:11.251 --> 00:04:13.553
"Your sister's going to
Tokyo University, right?

00:04:19.125 --> 00:04:22.495
She should've given half
her brains to you, Ryu."

00:04:23.296 --> 00:04:24.597
Are you serious?

00:04:26.132 --> 00:04:31.004
I got so mad and yelled,
"That's not funny!"

00:04:32.872 --> 00:04:36.142
But, ever since then...

00:04:39.112 --> 00:04:43.583
Ryu hasn't been the same.

00:04:48.021 --> 00:04:50.023
Can I ask what happened today?

00:04:52.025 --> 00:04:55.628
Lately, Ryu's been really agitated.

00:04:57.163 --> 00:04:59.365
I got a call from my mom

00:05:00.700 --> 00:05:02.368
saying she couldn't
calm him down by herself.

00:05:03.870 --> 00:05:06.339
So, I rushed home.

00:05:07.073 --> 00:05:08.775
When I got home,
he really was out of control.

00:05:12.779 --> 00:05:14.414
Without thinking, I said...

00:05:19.519 --> 00:05:21.220
"That's enough! Cut it out!"

00:05:23.389 --> 00:05:27.093
When I saw Ryu's palm
covered in blood

00:05:28.494 --> 00:05:30.330
I thought to myself...

00:05:32.365 --> 00:05:35.335
"Maybe the only thing
I can do is not be here."

00:05:36.769 --> 00:05:38.237
That's what crossed my mind.

00:05:51.317 --> 00:05:52.352
I see.

00:05:54.987 --> 00:05:56.756
Thanks for calling me.

00:06:02.161 --> 00:06:03.463
It meant a lot.

00:06:04.997 --> 00:06:05.998
What?

00:06:07.100 --> 00:06:08.301
Sounds silly, doesn't it?

00:06:10.570 --> 00:06:12.939
But having a student
rely on me like that...

00:06:14.474 --> 00:06:16.309
makes me really happy.

00:06:23.282 --> 00:06:24.751
We're in the middle of something
right now!

00:06:24.851 --> 00:06:27.019
Come on! Open up!

00:06:29.055 --> 00:06:30.123
Sorry.

00:06:36.763 --> 00:06:39.599
You must be starving.

00:06:39.699 --> 00:06:42.201
Here, warm yourself up
with something hot.

00:06:42.301 --> 00:06:44.404
Thank you.

00:06:44.504 --> 00:06:47.974
It's nothing. If anything,
you're the one working late.

00:06:49.142 --> 00:06:50.343
Say, Tominaga.

00:06:51.377 --> 00:06:53.212
Why don't you stay over tonight?

00:06:53.379 --> 00:06:54.380
What?

00:06:54.514 --> 00:06:55.782
Tomorrow's Saturday, anyway.

00:06:56.082 --> 00:06:58.050
I figured I might be meddling

00:06:58.151 --> 00:06:59.619
but I already called your mom.

00:06:59.685 --> 00:07:02.188
Wow, Mom for the win!

00:07:03.055 --> 00:07:05.224
She told me a little bit
about what's going on.

00:07:06.058 --> 00:07:07.393
So if you're okay with it...

00:07:08.561 --> 00:07:09.962
Thank you.

00:07:11.531 --> 00:07:13.833
All right then, it's settled!
Here, have some udon!

00:07:14.400 --> 00:07:17.370
Most things are manageable
if you eat udon.

00:07:18.538 --> 00:07:21.741
– Thank you for the food!
– Go ahead, enjoy.

00:07:22.008 --> 00:07:23.042
Take your time.

00:07:23.609 --> 00:07:24.811
Thank you.

00:07:41.794 --> 00:07:43.463
I've been worried this whole time.

00:07:45.231 --> 00:07:46.599
For these past four years

00:07:46.666 --> 00:07:48.768
I kept thinking
something might happen.

00:07:49.902 --> 00:07:54.207
Tokura told me everything.

00:07:56.175 --> 00:07:59.979
He hacked into the school system
to get the test questions.

00:08:01.981 --> 00:08:03.449
And he got caught.

00:08:08.287 --> 00:08:10.890
It was during a time
when I was struggling mentally

00:08:12.859 --> 00:08:14.861
and was completely unable to
keep up with my studies.

00:08:16.395 --> 00:08:19.499
So I panicked, and that's why...

00:08:20.833 --> 00:08:22.068
Please tell me.

00:08:24.203 --> 00:08:25.505
What really happened?

00:08:28.140 --> 00:08:30.476
I desperately negotiated
with the school

00:08:30.543 --> 00:08:33.112
so Tokura wouldn't be punished.

00:08:33.813 --> 00:08:34.814
That's all.

00:08:35.214 --> 00:08:37.517
I should've properly
faced the consequences.

00:08:38.451 --> 00:08:39.519
But...

00:08:42.221 --> 00:08:45.424
There must've been
some strings attached.

00:08:46.659 --> 00:08:49.695
It's way too suspicious that
he didn't face any consequences.

00:08:50.897 --> 00:08:54.033
He had always been
a dedicated student.

00:08:54.534 --> 00:08:56.536
He was pushed to the edge

00:08:56.636 --> 00:08:59.472
because the school failed to
look after his mental well-being.

00:09:00.273 --> 00:09:02.942
In other words,
it was my fault, wasn't it?

00:09:05.545 --> 00:09:06.846
When you put it like that...

00:09:08.381 --> 00:09:11.784
So a deal really was made, wasn't it?

00:09:14.086 --> 00:09:17.857
And the real reason
you left the school...

00:09:19.892 --> 00:09:21.527
It wasn't because of an affair.

00:09:23.396 --> 00:09:24.830
It was sexual assault.

00:09:29.535 --> 00:09:31.003
I looked up to you.

00:09:31.804 --> 00:09:34.106
You always put your students first

00:09:35.474 --> 00:09:37.376
and put yourself last.

00:09:39.011 --> 00:09:40.279
But maybe, Ms. Saejima...

00:09:41.180 --> 00:09:46.352
There are some things
you shouldn't put off, right?

00:09:49.488 --> 00:09:51.157
By protecting me

00:09:52.558 --> 00:09:54.860
you threw everything off balance.

00:09:56.228 --> 00:10:00.600
Because of that,
your daughter got hurt.

00:10:02.068 --> 00:10:04.003
She ended up
doing something terrible.

00:10:08.574 --> 00:10:09.809
I'm sorry.

00:10:14.413 --> 00:10:15.548
I'm so sorry.

00:10:16.782 --> 00:10:17.950
I'm really sorry.

00:10:33.232 --> 00:10:38.971
I was helping the school

00:10:41.140 --> 00:10:42.575
cover up its wrongdoing.

00:10:44.076 --> 00:10:45.144
Wrongdoing?

00:10:48.047 --> 00:10:49.882
For a long time,

00:10:50.182 --> 00:10:53.052
Rintoku had been accepting students
through illegitimate admissions.

00:10:55.254 --> 00:10:56.389
Don't tell me...

00:10:57.556 --> 00:11:01.027
Did Mr. Tsutsui find out
and he started blackmailing you?

00:11:03.095 --> 00:11:04.096
Yes.

00:11:05.531 --> 00:11:08.401
Do you have any kind of proof?

00:11:08.801 --> 00:11:09.902
No, I don't.

00:11:15.975 --> 00:11:17.243
Tokura.

00:11:20.746 --> 00:11:23.049
I should be the one apologizing.

00:11:25.017 --> 00:11:26.919
I was going in circles all on my own.

00:11:28.621 --> 00:11:29.989
I hurt people.

00:11:32.591 --> 00:11:33.959
I hurt you.

00:11:36.362 --> 00:11:37.797
I hurt my daughter, too.

00:11:43.836 --> 00:11:44.837
Ms. Saejima.

00:11:47.673 --> 00:11:48.908
I will never forget.

00:11:51.110 --> 00:11:52.511
I'll never forget that

00:11:52.978 --> 00:11:54.980
you protected me
with everything you had.

00:11:56.348 --> 00:11:59.318
I'll remember it
for the rest of my life.

00:12:45.631 --> 00:12:46.799
To Mayama Yuzuru

00:12:52.571 --> 00:12:55.541
You can solve it easily if you think
about gradient with tangent, right?

00:12:55.641 --> 00:12:56.642
I see.

00:12:56.742 --> 00:12:58.410
You don't have to force it
into the cosine rule.

00:12:58.544 --> 00:13:01.280
Wait! My synapses are firing!

00:13:01.380 --> 00:13:04.416
Yeah, and now the brain cells
are connecting with a bang!

00:13:04.517 --> 00:13:08.387
What's going on? It's like,
"Good morning, new world!"

00:13:08.487 --> 00:13:10.289
I might be having
a "good morning" too.

00:13:10.756 --> 00:13:12.258
Yeah!

00:13:12.792 --> 00:13:15.127
Let's move on to the next question.
Try solving this as a challenge.

00:13:15.227 --> 00:13:16.228
Sure, sounds good!

00:13:16.328 --> 00:13:18.464
Hold up. This might not be
a good morning for me.

00:13:18.931 --> 00:13:21.433
This is from Mai.

00:13:23.702 --> 00:13:25.404
– Here.
– What's this?

00:13:30.609 --> 00:13:33.179
It's adorable. Thanks.

00:13:33.712 --> 00:13:34.980
Mai really wanted to come.

00:13:35.080 --> 00:13:38.484
– Yeah, I know.
– You really are loved.

00:13:38.584 --> 00:13:40.152
I'm not sure about that.

00:13:41.153 --> 00:13:45.724
She's mad at me because
I'm useless when it counts.

00:13:49.328 --> 00:13:50.429
Tsubuki.

00:13:52.298 --> 00:13:54.099
What are you going to do
after the surgery?

00:13:55.134 --> 00:13:57.102
What? What do you mean?

00:13:57.203 --> 00:13:59.471
Are you coming back to
the Ministry of Education?

00:14:04.777 --> 00:14:08.714
I'm not in the state of mind to
think about that right now.

00:14:13.986 --> 00:14:15.354
Personally...

00:14:16.689 --> 00:14:18.924
Of course, I want you to come back.

00:14:21.126 --> 00:14:24.530
Now, with that in mind,
I want you to hear me out.

00:14:26.665 --> 00:14:29.768
If you're going to quit,
now's the time.

00:14:35.474 --> 00:14:37.243
That's ridiculous.

00:14:41.313 --> 00:14:42.481
Tsubuki...

00:14:45.150 --> 00:14:46.819
You're the second one, you know.

00:14:51.123 --> 00:14:52.324
Yeah, I know.

00:14:56.228 --> 00:14:59.398
He collapsed, which led to
a mental breakdown.

00:14:59.899 --> 00:15:03.335
And in the end, he took his own life.

00:15:12.678 --> 00:15:14.146
I saw the signs.

00:15:16.015 --> 00:15:18.751
But having Mikami
point it out for me...

00:15:21.320 --> 00:15:22.855
My pride got the best of me.

00:15:50.849 --> 00:15:52.017
You're afraid and worried,
aren't you?

00:15:53.452 --> 00:15:54.453
Yeah.

00:15:57.389 --> 00:16:01.493
I'm so scared that I can't sleep.

00:16:16.241 --> 00:16:18.844
If you do come back, I'll support you
with everything I've got.

00:16:19.712 --> 00:16:22.915
And if you change careers,
I'll help you in any way I can.

00:16:28.754 --> 00:16:30.089
Thank you.

00:16:36.261 --> 00:16:37.696
But...

00:16:39.198 --> 00:16:41.500
Are you really in a position
to be worrying about me?

00:16:42.267 --> 00:16:45.204
You're looking pretty terrible
right now, Makino.

00:16:50.642 --> 00:16:53.679
I'm fine, really.

00:16:57.649 --> 00:16:58.650
See?

00:17:00.252 --> 00:17:02.154
That looks good.

00:17:02.654 --> 00:17:04.923
When you were little

00:17:05.024 --> 00:17:07.159
your mom never let you have any cake
when you asked for it.

00:17:07.960 --> 00:17:10.462
– Yeah, it's delicious.
– Yeah.

00:17:12.798 --> 00:17:14.333
I was able to talk to Mr. Tokui.

00:17:14.767 --> 00:17:17.369
I heard that the chairman
and Mr. Tokui

00:17:17.469 --> 00:17:19.004
were high school classmates.

00:17:19.538 --> 00:17:22.941
But, he didn't donate
which seemed suspicious.

00:17:23.542 --> 00:17:26.211
Actually, Mr. Tokui was
involved as an external auditor

00:17:26.278 --> 00:17:29.448
when the prep school
was first established.

00:17:29.681 --> 00:17:30.916
Really?

00:17:31.350 --> 00:17:33.118
And even back then

00:17:33.752 --> 00:17:36.722
there were rumors about
under-the-table money.

00:17:36.789 --> 00:17:38.357
That's why he pulled out.

00:17:40.726 --> 00:17:45.531
Mr. Tokui said maybe
Mr. Kodai is the kind of person

00:17:45.631 --> 00:17:49.168
who ends up deceiving even himself
while spouting his ideals.

00:17:49.601 --> 00:17:51.370
Chairman Kodai had a way of

00:17:51.437 --> 00:17:56.141
making everyone he meets
believe he was a wonderful educator.

00:17:57.109 --> 00:17:59.011
Even I was one of them.

00:18:10.122 --> 00:18:12.858
Your mom used to worry.

00:18:15.094 --> 00:18:18.063
Because you were
frail and a picky eater

00:18:18.831 --> 00:18:22.701
she would say, "If I let her
eat cake, she won't eat dinner."

00:18:27.039 --> 00:18:30.943
She was also the one
who connected you to Mr. Tokui.

00:18:31.844 --> 00:18:32.845
What?

00:18:34.379 --> 00:18:38.050
I'm sure your feelings
got through to her.

00:18:53.732 --> 00:18:54.867
Tominaga.

00:18:56.602 --> 00:18:58.403
Tominaga, are you okay?

00:18:58.504 --> 00:18:59.671
What are you talking about?

00:19:00.439 --> 00:19:04.076
Okami's got to be up to something
if he called us out here, right?

00:19:06.211 --> 00:19:08.147
I felt better after eating the udon.

00:19:08.413 --> 00:19:10.082
So, I'm all good.

00:19:10.182 --> 00:19:11.183
Got it.

00:19:11.850 --> 00:19:13.152
Sorry you had to come
all the way out here.

00:19:13.252 --> 00:19:15.521
– No worries.
– Shall we go?

00:19:22.995 --> 00:19:23.996
Mom.

00:19:26.064 --> 00:19:28.634
Kota, you came?

00:19:28.967 --> 00:19:29.968
I want you to meet some people.

00:19:30.802 --> 00:19:35.374
These are my students,
Tominaga and Tsugimoto.

00:19:35.941 --> 00:19:38.644
– Nice to meet you.
– Hello.

00:19:42.114 --> 00:19:46.285
Mom, can we talk outside for a bit?

00:20:00.666 --> 00:20:02.701
Would you mind listening too?

00:20:03.869 --> 00:20:06.338
I think it's finally
time to deal with

00:20:06.805 --> 00:20:08.540
something I've been
putting off for far too long.

00:20:10.142 --> 00:20:11.777
Will you stay with me
while I face it?

00:20:17.449 --> 00:20:20.319
This place is one of
my mother's favorite places.

00:20:57.256 --> 00:20:58.724
Hey, Mom.

00:21:02.427 --> 00:21:04.096
I'm Takashi.

00:21:06.632 --> 00:21:08.567
Do you understand?

00:21:08.634 --> 00:21:09.968
Takashi.

00:21:11.003 --> 00:21:12.638
What are you saying?

00:21:12.704 --> 00:21:14.439
You're Kota.

00:21:17.542 --> 00:21:18.744
Kota...

00:21:22.781 --> 00:21:24.149
He died.

00:21:25.317 --> 00:21:26.885
Twenty-two years ago.

00:21:30.956 --> 00:21:32.924
If it was what you needed, Mom...

00:21:35.227 --> 00:21:36.628
If it made you feel better...

00:21:39.398 --> 00:21:41.066
I was okay with being Kota.

00:21:45.537 --> 00:21:46.538
But...

00:21:50.375 --> 00:21:51.777
But that was a lie.

00:21:55.080 --> 00:22:02.087
Every time you called me Kota

00:22:08.560 --> 00:22:10.295
I felt like I couldn't breathe.

00:22:15.000 --> 00:22:16.335
That's how much it hurt.

00:22:21.406 --> 00:22:23.275
I knew I had to face it.

00:22:25.977 --> 00:22:27.179
That's what I thought.

00:22:36.588 --> 00:22:42.361
I am Mikami Takashi.

00:22:46.932 --> 00:22:49.034
Mikami Kota died.

00:22:52.804 --> 00:22:56.675
I'm the one who killed him.

00:22:57.976 --> 00:22:59.478
It's not your fault, Mom.

00:23:02.013 --> 00:23:03.215
Kota...

00:23:05.484 --> 00:23:11.857
Big brother made that choice himself.

00:23:13.625 --> 00:23:15.193
No...

00:23:16.595 --> 00:23:19.564
It was all my fault.

00:23:22.734 --> 00:23:23.735
Mom.

00:23:27.205 --> 00:23:28.440
I...

00:23:33.678 --> 00:23:36.148
I've always lived as if I were
living for both Kota and myself.

00:23:43.755 --> 00:23:48.293
It's always been that way.

00:23:52.297 --> 00:23:53.532
And it always will.

00:24:09.781 --> 00:24:10.782
Takashi?

00:24:30.502 --> 00:24:31.903
That's right.

00:24:34.239 --> 00:24:35.574
I'm Takashi.

00:25:05.570 --> 00:25:09.040
I'm going to talk with Ryu.

00:25:13.578 --> 00:25:14.613
But...

00:25:16.948 --> 00:25:17.949
Yes?

00:25:19.584 --> 00:25:21.019
This is just my guess...

00:25:23.855 --> 00:25:28.393
But the next time I see my mom

00:25:29.528 --> 00:25:36.434
she'll act like nothing happened
and just call me Kota again.

00:25:37.936 --> 00:25:43.942
Your brother might not respond
the way you hope he will, either.

00:25:46.244 --> 00:25:47.846
You understand that, right?

00:25:50.649 --> 00:25:51.816
I do.

00:25:54.152 --> 00:25:56.855
I know that his feelings and
his words don't always match.

00:25:59.524 --> 00:26:00.525
I understand that.

00:26:03.261 --> 00:26:05.163
If even we struggle with that

00:26:08.633 --> 00:26:11.670
then it's probably
much harder for Ryu.

00:26:17.275 --> 00:26:18.276
But...

00:26:22.547 --> 00:26:23.682
Today...

00:26:27.118 --> 00:26:31.790
I just want to say,
"I love you, Ryu."

00:26:34.426 --> 00:26:39.064
I adore him, I love him so much.

00:26:41.866 --> 00:26:43.668
But I've never been able to say it.

00:26:47.405 --> 00:26:53.044
And that's what hurt the most.

00:26:57.449 --> 00:27:01.519
If the next time you see her

00:27:03.321 --> 00:27:05.557
she were to call you Kota again...

00:27:09.761 --> 00:27:13.865
You'd still be glad you told her,
wouldn't you, Okami?

00:27:16.334 --> 00:27:17.469
I would.

00:27:32.751 --> 00:27:34.953
What the heck, Jigen?

00:27:39.157 --> 00:27:41.259
What the heck, Okami?

00:27:41.493 --> 00:27:42.494
I'm good.

00:27:42.627 --> 00:27:44.329
Here you go, Okami.

00:27:52.937 --> 00:27:54.639
You know, it's kind of amazing.

00:27:54.973 --> 00:27:56.274
What's this about?

00:27:57.542 --> 00:27:59.010
If I'm going to be a prosecutor

00:27:59.411 --> 00:28:01.846
I need to learn more
about how different people live.

00:28:02.647 --> 00:28:04.883
You'll make a great
legal professional.

00:28:05.250 --> 00:28:06.251
What?

00:28:06.851 --> 00:28:10.021
It's a job that you probably can't do
you don't understand what love is.

00:28:10.755 --> 00:28:12.991
In fact, you shouldn't do it.

00:28:14.392 --> 00:28:18.963
Wow, you suddenly dumped
a lot of pressure on me.

00:28:19.531 --> 00:28:22.500
– I can walk alone from here.
– I see, okay.

00:28:24.803 --> 00:28:26.771
– Good luck.
– I'll do my best.

00:28:32.444 --> 00:28:36.147
Miyazawa, Fuyuki,
did you pass the AO exam?

00:28:36.347 --> 00:28:38.683
– Yeah, kind of.
– What about you?

00:28:38.817 --> 00:28:41.219
I've changed gears and decided to
focus on the standardized test.

00:28:41.319 --> 00:28:43.888
So you didn't pass?

00:28:45.190 --> 00:28:46.224
Did something happen?

00:28:46.391 --> 00:28:49.227
Wakui's too popular.
I haven't gotten my turn yet.

00:28:49.427 --> 00:28:52.363
Guess I have no choice.
You'll have to help me, Okami.

00:28:52.597 --> 00:28:54.199
That's no way to ask for help.

00:28:54.299 --> 00:28:57.402
Then be as nice as Wakui.

00:28:57.502 --> 00:28:59.938
Jeez. So what don't you get?

00:29:00.038 --> 00:29:01.039
The inverse image method...

00:29:01.773 --> 00:29:03.441
– I've mostly recovered.
– That's good.

00:29:04.075 --> 00:29:07.946
Ms. Koreeda. Do you
also teach classical Chinese?

00:29:08.046 --> 00:29:10.782
I do! In fact, I'd be happy to.

00:29:11.082 --> 00:29:12.817
Okay, if you're lost in
classical Chinese

00:29:12.917 --> 00:29:13.918
gather around Ms. Koreeda!

00:29:14.018 --> 00:29:15.820
– Yes!
– Let's go. Let's do it.

00:29:15.920 --> 00:29:17.555
– Want to try something else?
– Yeah.

00:29:19.023 --> 00:29:22.293
– Good morning, Tominaga!
– Good morning!

00:29:22.393 --> 00:29:23.628
How did it go?

00:29:24.129 --> 00:29:25.930
It was pretty emotional.

00:29:26.030 --> 00:29:28.533
Wow, that's great.

00:29:35.840 --> 00:29:37.809
For the specified X and Y pair,

00:29:37.909 --> 00:29:41.012
check if a T exists
that meets the condition.

00:29:42.347 --> 00:29:43.915
– Good job.
– What?

00:29:44.048 --> 00:29:46.251
– Congrats!
– Yay!

00:29:48.586 --> 00:29:51.756
The attitude of
agreeing with one's lord...

00:29:52.423 --> 00:29:53.725
Wait, hey, listen.

00:29:54.125 --> 00:29:56.394
Pointing out mistakes
and correcting them...

00:29:56.561 --> 00:29:59.330
– Your handwriting sucks.
– What?

00:29:59.564 --> 00:30:02.100
– Write properly.
– My handwriting?

00:30:04.869 --> 00:30:05.870
Begin.

00:30:41.706 --> 00:30:42.707
Stop.

00:30:48.580 --> 00:30:49.581
Okami.

00:30:52.217 --> 00:30:57.589
Tomorrow, Yuzuru is
meeting with Ms. Saejima.

00:30:58.723 --> 00:31:00.158
Are you going to be there?

00:31:00.825 --> 00:31:02.594
Yes.

00:31:02.694 --> 00:31:03.761
I see.

00:31:03.862 --> 00:31:06.431
Let's do a post-test review,
Kanzaki!

00:31:07.065 --> 00:31:08.066
Got it.

00:31:10.902 --> 00:31:11.903
Excuse me.

00:31:12.303 --> 00:31:13.538
Come on.

00:31:14.505 --> 00:31:16.574
Thanks to you, I was able to
nail the essay questions.

00:31:16.674 --> 00:31:17.809
That's good.

00:31:20.778 --> 00:31:22.413
About the other day...

00:31:22.981 --> 00:31:26.217
I'd like for you
to take over for Mizohata

00:31:26.551 --> 00:31:30.688
and help make Rintoku
an even better school.

00:31:32.557 --> 00:31:33.791
Thank you.

00:31:34.792 --> 00:31:38.630
I'd like you to
meet with Nakaoka next time.

00:31:38.730 --> 00:31:39.731
Of course.

00:31:39.831 --> 00:31:40.899
When that time comes

00:31:40.965 --> 00:31:43.001
there's something
I'd like to ask of you.

00:31:43.468 --> 00:31:44.469
Sure.

00:31:46.604 --> 00:31:49.107
I'll be in touch.

00:31:54.545 --> 00:31:56.080
Hello, Tsukada speaking.

00:31:56.447 --> 00:31:58.082
I spoke with Mikami.

00:31:58.416 --> 00:32:00.818
And what did he say?

00:32:01.085 --> 00:32:02.453
He accepted the offer.

00:32:04.722 --> 00:32:07.292
So you're choosing Mikami.

00:32:07.525 --> 00:32:10.161
Yes. We hope he'll handle
the damage control

00:32:10.261 --> 00:32:12.997
regarding ex-Chief Cabinet
Secretary Azuma as well.

00:32:13.097 --> 00:32:17.602
I also got word from Nakaoka
that Makino's no good.

00:32:18.569 --> 00:32:19.971
Because of his jealousy toward Mikami

00:32:20.305 --> 00:32:22.407
he's turning into Mizohata.

00:32:22.540 --> 00:32:29.380
Anyone without a vision for
education needs to step aside.

00:32:30.415 --> 00:32:31.416
Talk to you soon.

00:32:39.590 --> 00:32:41.259
It's just as I thought.

00:32:41.859 --> 00:32:44.095
If they want to revise
the national budget estimates

00:32:44.195 --> 00:32:45.330
they need to act now.

00:32:45.463 --> 00:32:47.332
He is trying to win me over.

00:32:47.432 --> 00:32:49.334
– It'll get soggy.
– What?

00:32:51.903 --> 00:32:53.638
If you let ramen this good go soggy

00:32:54.906 --> 00:32:57.108
you'll get bad luck.

00:33:07.485 --> 00:33:11.522
I believe Mr. Mizohata
will come around.

00:33:13.091 --> 00:33:17.795
When I joined, he was
passionate about education.

00:33:18.796 --> 00:33:22.000
But somewhere
along the way, he changed.

00:33:23.434 --> 00:33:29.674
Many people have become victims of
Chairman Kodai's ideal of education.

00:33:30.675 --> 00:33:31.876
Like baboons.

00:33:34.012 --> 00:33:38.850
Baboons pretend to kindly warn
the gazelles of an approaching lion.

00:33:39.984 --> 00:33:41.552
And once the gazelles
let their guard down

00:33:41.652 --> 00:33:43.788
the baboons eat their babies.

00:33:45.089 --> 00:33:48.526
Well, to Chairman Kodai, his ideal of
education probably isn't a lie.

00:33:48.626 --> 00:33:50.461
After all, there really is
a lion out there.

00:33:50.561 --> 00:33:52.930
Yeah, that's true.

00:33:53.231 --> 00:33:55.833
And thinking it's better
than being eaten by the lion

00:33:55.933 --> 00:33:58.569
he eats
the gazelle's children himself.

00:34:00.304 --> 00:34:02.473
– Good, isn't it?
– What?

00:34:02.807 --> 00:34:03.841
This ramen...

00:34:04.275 --> 00:34:06.277
Half-Day Off

00:34:06.944 --> 00:34:08.513
Makino, are you leaving for the day?

00:34:08.780 --> 00:34:09.847
Yes.

00:34:09.914 --> 00:34:12.116
Tsubuki is having surgery today

00:34:12.683 --> 00:34:14.986
and his wife's been in labor
since yesterday.

00:34:15.186 --> 00:34:17.288
You're taking
half a day off for that?

00:34:18.156 --> 00:34:20.525
That's right, I'm taking
half a day off for that.

00:35:05.336 --> 00:35:06.370
Listen...

00:35:08.072 --> 00:35:09.073
What is it?

00:35:13.644 --> 00:35:18.249
I didn't want to forget
what I wanted to say

00:35:18.349 --> 00:35:19.817
so I wrote it down.

00:35:30.828 --> 00:35:31.863
First...

00:35:36.267 --> 00:35:38.503
I won't see you anymore.

00:35:38.803 --> 00:35:39.804
What?

00:35:40.071 --> 00:35:41.072
Second...

00:35:43.541 --> 00:35:48.746
Mom, please forget about me.

00:35:50.381 --> 00:35:51.415
Third...

00:35:53.484 --> 00:35:59.257
I'm the one who killed
Shibutani Yusuke.

00:35:59.490 --> 00:36:00.758
Yuzuru...

00:36:00.858 --> 00:36:01.926
Fourth...

00:36:06.564 --> 00:36:08.099
It's not your fault.

00:36:09.233 --> 00:36:10.635
Yuzuru, stop...

00:36:10.735 --> 00:36:11.836
Fifth...

00:36:20.411 --> 00:36:25.483
I'm really sorry.

00:36:27.652 --> 00:36:30.254
Yuzuru, listen...

00:36:30.555 --> 00:36:31.822
That's everything.

00:36:43.501 --> 00:36:44.702
Yuzuru...

00:36:48.206 --> 00:36:49.373
I understand.

00:36:50.875 --> 00:36:52.743
I really do, but...

00:36:52.843 --> 00:36:55.046
This is between me and my mother.

00:37:01.385 --> 00:37:03.955
Yuzuru, listen.

00:37:06.791 --> 00:37:12.263
Everyone here carries
some kind of guilt.

00:37:16.767 --> 00:37:18.603
A guilt that
can't be shared with anyone else.

00:37:21.906 --> 00:37:23.474
That guilt doesn't go away.

00:37:25.076 --> 00:37:28.913
Because no matter what we do

00:37:28.980 --> 00:37:31.482
Shibutani Yusuke isn't coming back.

00:37:35.319 --> 00:37:36.320
But...

00:37:39.423 --> 00:37:41.058
I know...

00:37:43.394 --> 00:37:46.163
how much it means
for Ms. Saejima to be here.

00:37:49.133 --> 00:37:54.505
I do know that.

00:38:05.416 --> 00:38:08.686
I understand
what you're trying to say.

00:38:12.123 --> 00:38:13.824
I think I understand.

00:38:16.394 --> 00:38:20.164
You want to
take responsibility on your own.

00:38:24.168 --> 00:38:29.507
Kanzaki and Mr. Mikami...

00:38:31.042 --> 00:38:35.413
They taught you that, didn't they?

00:38:41.886 --> 00:38:43.854
And here I was...

00:38:44.588 --> 00:38:47.024
thinking it would be enough
if I just sacrificed myself.

00:38:49.026 --> 00:38:51.195
I left you all alone.

00:38:55.499 --> 00:38:57.335
I told myself it was all for you.

00:38:59.103 --> 00:39:00.938
That it was all for my students.

00:39:02.406 --> 00:39:04.909
But I never stopped to see that
setting that kind of example

00:39:07.378 --> 00:39:10.948
was the worst thing I could have done

00:39:11.148 --> 00:39:16.087
as a mother and as a teacher.

00:39:19.757 --> 00:39:24.662
And I pushed you to the edge.

00:39:29.500 --> 00:39:32.970
I'll think carefully
about what you said.

00:39:34.772 --> 00:39:36.640
But please, just give me
one more chance.

00:39:39.143 --> 00:39:41.112
Let me talk with you.

00:39:52.123 --> 00:39:54.425
– Wow...
– What is it?

00:39:54.725 --> 00:39:57.561
The results from the mock exam
the other day are out.

00:39:57.661 --> 00:40:00.064
Class 3-2 had
an unbelievable jump in grades.

00:40:00.698 --> 00:40:02.800
Wow, you're right. That's amazing.

00:40:02.900 --> 00:40:05.169
– It's wild, right?
– Even their geography improved.

00:40:05.302 --> 00:40:06.604
That's awesome.

00:40:09.540 --> 00:40:12.777
Mr. Mikami, everyone said
their rankings improved.

00:40:12.877 --> 00:40:14.812
It looks like your head's
still on your shoulders.

00:40:14.912 --> 00:40:18.115
Yeah, I came back
from the guillotine.

00:40:19.183 --> 00:40:20.184
All right!

00:40:20.918 --> 00:40:23.020
Let's get started!

00:40:24.422 --> 00:40:26.090
All right, let's do this!

00:40:26.190 --> 00:40:28.392
– Let's give it a shot.
– Yeah.

00:40:32.029 --> 00:40:33.364
This is amazing.

00:40:36.801 --> 00:40:40.905
They're talking
about studying, right?

00:40:42.673 --> 00:40:43.774
Yes.

00:40:43.874 --> 00:40:46.110
– Should we start with math?
– Can we?

00:40:46.210 --> 00:40:48.045
I didn't know
something like this was possible.

00:40:48.145 --> 00:40:49.713
Geography?
What about geography?

00:40:49.847 --> 00:40:54.285
Geography went up by,
let's see... seven points.

00:40:57.655 --> 00:40:58.656
Right.

00:41:05.896 --> 00:41:07.998
Thanks again for the other day.

00:41:08.165 --> 00:41:09.366
Don't mention it.

00:41:10.134 --> 00:41:11.802
If you hadn't been there,

00:41:11.869 --> 00:41:16.006
I might've just pretended to be
a reasonable adult and left again.

00:41:17.875 --> 00:41:22.379
When you're my age, it's not easy to
change even if you want to.

00:41:24.915 --> 00:41:28.552
It's hard for people
to change, period.

00:41:30.154 --> 00:41:31.689
It's not about age.

00:41:34.492 --> 00:41:35.493
You're right.

00:41:39.730 --> 00:41:42.933
This is the first time
you reached out.

00:41:45.870 --> 00:41:46.971
Actually...

00:41:48.806 --> 00:41:49.807
Here you go.

00:41:58.249 --> 00:41:59.617
What? What's this?

00:42:01.485 --> 00:42:02.853
Aren't you going to
look at what's on here?

00:42:03.220 --> 00:42:06.290
I want to, but Okami said to wait.

00:42:07.291 --> 00:42:08.459
They should be here soon.

00:42:08.726 --> 00:42:10.394
What? Someone's coming?

00:42:10.494 --> 00:42:12.096
I don't know who it is either.

00:42:16.834 --> 00:42:18.769
Mr. Yamato Takeru is here.

00:42:18.869 --> 00:42:19.870
What?

00:42:20.170 --> 00:42:21.605
What are you talking about?

00:42:21.939 --> 00:42:23.908
He said you'd know.

00:42:24.141 --> 00:42:25.442
What's that about?

00:42:30.748 --> 00:42:31.749
What?

00:42:34.051 --> 00:42:35.052
What?

00:42:36.554 --> 00:42:38.622
W-Wait, seriously?!

00:42:38.722 --> 00:42:39.924
Let me introduce you.

00:42:40.024 --> 00:42:41.926
This is my colleague from
the Ministry of Education

00:42:43.294 --> 00:42:44.728
Makino Kyosuke.

00:42:45.696 --> 00:42:47.398
Also known as Yamato Takeru.

00:42:48.198 --> 00:42:50.334
Nice to meet you. I'm Makino.

00:42:50.834 --> 00:42:52.369
What's going on?

00:42:53.270 --> 00:42:54.738
Makino and I are colleagues.

00:42:54.838 --> 00:42:58.108
While I've been investigating Rintoku

00:42:58.208 --> 00:42:59.977
Makino has been tracking
any movements within the ministry.

00:43:00.077 --> 00:43:02.012
So you've been
working together from the start?

00:43:02.112 --> 00:43:03.314
Pretty much.

00:43:03.514 --> 00:43:05.849
I thought we promised
no more secrets?

00:43:06.016 --> 00:43:07.618
This really is the last one.

00:43:07.718 --> 00:43:09.687
You bureaucrats are so irritating!

00:43:09.787 --> 00:43:12.289
You must be Tominaga.

00:43:12.389 --> 00:43:13.791
Yeah, is there a problem?

00:43:13.891 --> 00:43:16.093
I heard you gave Okami
a piece of your mind.

00:43:17.361 --> 00:43:21.465
Which means you're the landlord,
right, Jigen?

00:43:21.565 --> 00:43:24.468
And you must be Kanzaki.

00:43:24.568 --> 00:43:25.569
Nice to meet you.

00:43:25.669 --> 00:43:28.639
So much for privacy.

00:43:28.739 --> 00:43:31.008
I've been looking forward to
meeting you all.

00:43:32.910 --> 00:43:34.011
Let's look at the data.

00:43:37.381 --> 00:43:39.550
She gave it all to me

00:43:40.951 --> 00:43:42.286
including the reason
it couldn't be shared before.

00:43:42.920 --> 00:43:44.355
This is?

00:43:44.588 --> 00:43:46.557
It's the data I took. All of it.

00:43:47.925 --> 00:43:49.627
But you said there wasn't any proof.

00:43:49.727 --> 00:43:51.996
There was a reason
I couldn't bring it out.

00:43:55.065 --> 00:43:59.236
Tokura Itsuki wasn't the only one
you were protecting.

00:43:59.470 --> 00:44:02.306
Giving this to you will place
a heavy burden on your shoulders

00:44:03.240 --> 00:44:06.844
but I've chosen to trust you.

00:44:09.380 --> 00:44:10.381
I see.

00:44:11.749 --> 00:44:12.750
Device detected.

00:44:13.917 --> 00:44:15.452
Hey, Lupin. Let's do this.

00:44:15.786 --> 00:44:16.787
Gotcha.

00:44:16.854 --> 00:44:18.789
The names on this list...

00:44:19.323 --> 00:44:21.592
They're probably the reason
she couldn't release it.

00:44:27.231 --> 00:44:29.867
So these are the students
who were fraudulently admitted?

00:44:30.868 --> 00:44:32.636
There aren't as many as I expected.

00:44:33.404 --> 00:44:35.739
We might be
the top school in the prefecture

00:44:35.873 --> 00:44:37.408
but it's probably about right
since this isn't Tokyo.

00:44:40.044 --> 00:44:41.045
What?

00:44:46.083 --> 00:44:48.018
Sis, dinner's ready.

00:45:01.865 --> 00:45:03.000
Coming.

00:45:04.902 --> 00:45:06.270
Chigira Haruka
Donor and Relationship: Father

00:45:06.904 --> 00:45:08.105
Chigira?

00:45:24.888 --> 00:45:26.690
Final Episode

00:45:26.790 --> 00:45:29.026
We can finally expose the full scope
of Rintoku's corruption.

00:45:29.126 --> 00:45:31.095
Here is an assignment
from Yamato Takeru.

00:45:31.195 --> 00:45:33.764
Photos, audio data, witnesses...
All of it is there.

00:45:33.864 --> 00:45:34.932
All the dots have been connected.

00:45:35.032 --> 00:45:36.467
The school took
that freedom away from you.

00:45:36.533 --> 00:45:38.335
- I am involved too.
- It's finally starting...

00:45:38.435 --> 00:45:41.305
It's a fight for the survival
of Japan's education.

00:45:41.405 --> 00:45:43.540
This year was way more difficult
than I ever imagined.

00:45:43.640 --> 00:45:46.844
But every time, you all came up
with solutions that defied belief.
