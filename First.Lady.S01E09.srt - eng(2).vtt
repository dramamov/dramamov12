ALL NAMES, CHARACTERS,
AND EVENTS ARE FICTIONAL

00:00:43.106 --> 00:00:45.066
CHILD AND ANIMAL WELFARE
REGULATIONS WERE OBSERVED

00:00:47.735 --> 00:00:49.153
There are no secrets.

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:52.156
There are

00:00:53.324 --> 00:00:54.826
no copies or recordings.

00:00:57.954 --> 00:00:58.955
But

00:01:00.039 --> 00:01:01.416
vote based on

00:01:04.210 --> 00:01:06.963
your individual choice,
not based on your party.

00:01:08.214 --> 00:01:10.049
The weight your vote holds…

00:01:11.092 --> 00:01:13.678
Don't share it
with your fellow assemblymen.

00:01:15.138 --> 00:01:17.515
The right and responsibility
of the vote belongs

00:01:18.641 --> 00:01:19.684
solely to you.

00:01:21.269 --> 00:01:23.897
Don't lay your responsibility
on your party.

00:01:23.980 --> 00:01:26.691
Just like how I named the special act
after one person,

00:01:27.734 --> 00:01:28.943
for today's vote,

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:31.654
vote as an individual,

00:01:32.739 --> 00:01:34.866
not as a party member.

00:01:36.326 --> 00:01:38.411
I just want to know.

00:01:39.454 --> 00:01:40.705
Fifteen years ago.

00:01:42.957 --> 00:01:44.918
April 2, 2012.

00:01:49.297 --> 00:01:51.758
Why Tae-hun had to face such a death.

00:01:53.051 --> 00:01:54.510
I just want to know that.

00:01:56.262 --> 00:01:59.307
Why people try to stop me
from uncovering that day's truth.

00:02:01.517 --> 00:02:04.145
And what exactly happened on that day.

00:02:09.651 --> 00:02:11.694
I must know the truth.

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:30.338
AGREEMENT

00:02:32.423 --> 00:02:35.009
SUSPECT'S GUARDIAN: LEE HWA-JIN
ATTESTED BY ATTORNEY KANG SEON-HO

00:02:37.512 --> 00:02:39.597
You can sign there.

00:02:43.518 --> 00:02:46.437
LEE HWA-JIN

00:02:54.278 --> 00:02:55.822
I'll get going then.

00:02:57.782 --> 00:02:58.866
U-yeong…

00:03:00.910 --> 00:03:02.704
Are you bringing him next time?

00:03:11.963 --> 00:03:13.548
I'll do my best.

00:03:14.257 --> 00:03:15.758
Did you talk to Reporter Son?

00:03:16.759 --> 00:03:18.720
Yes. I'm meeting her today.

00:03:19.345 --> 00:03:22.306
After the interview,
U-yeong will be released.

00:03:23.016 --> 00:03:25.810
I'm counting on you.

00:03:43.328 --> 00:03:44.829
What did he say?

00:03:45.371 --> 00:03:48.333
Will he disclose the ledger
if the special act doesn't pass?

00:03:51.502 --> 00:03:54.839
You should step up
and stop the assemblymen from voting yes.

00:03:54.922 --> 00:03:58.593
No. Stop them from entering
the plenary meeting at all. Right now!

00:03:58.676 --> 00:03:59.761
The president-elect

00:04:00.261 --> 00:04:03.056
has a very different way
of handling things from you.

00:04:04.182 --> 00:04:06.434
He didn't ask us to vote yes or no.

00:04:06.517 --> 00:04:09.103
He gave us a choice.

00:04:09.896 --> 00:04:13.066
Are you saying
you're not going to listen to me?

00:04:14.233 --> 00:04:16.778
Do you realize I might have the copies?

00:04:16.861 --> 00:04:18.237
It doesn't matter

00:04:18.321 --> 00:04:20.490
whether there are copies or not.

00:04:21.240 --> 00:04:22.158
What?

00:04:22.241 --> 00:04:24.577
If everyone knows, it's not a secret.

00:04:24.660 --> 00:04:29.123
Since the president-elect disclosed it,
that secret has lost its power.

00:04:29.207 --> 00:04:33.544
Whether there's a copy or not
doesn't matter anymore.

00:04:33.628 --> 00:04:37.340
The problem now is,
anyone who votes against it

00:04:37.423 --> 00:04:40.635
will have to be responsible for it.

00:04:41.302 --> 00:04:42.303
Mr. Noh.

00:04:42.387 --> 00:04:47.141
This is probably the last time
we'll talk on the phone like this.

00:04:47.225 --> 00:04:50.228
Once the special act is passed,
you'll get in trouble too.

00:04:50.728 --> 00:04:53.147
Do you think
I'll just let you get away with this?

00:04:53.231 --> 00:04:55.149
I'm not sure what you're talking about,

00:04:55.233 --> 00:04:58.403
but there's one thing
that you don't have but I do.

00:04:58.903 --> 00:05:01.906
It's the National Assembly member's

00:05:01.989 --> 00:05:04.033
immunity.

00:05:04.951 --> 00:05:05.785
What?

00:05:05.868 --> 00:05:08.496
I suggest you first look into
how the president-elect

00:05:08.579 --> 00:05:10.039
got a hold of the ledger.

00:05:10.123 --> 00:05:13.709
After the special act is passed
and the investigation starts,

00:05:13.793 --> 00:05:17.505
if information still keeps leaking,
you'll be in serious trouble.

00:05:17.588 --> 00:05:18.881
Goodbye, then.

00:05:24.262 --> 00:05:25.221
I'll get going now.

00:05:27.640 --> 00:05:29.267
By the way,

00:05:29.851 --> 00:05:31.561
I didn't get to eat today.

00:05:31.644 --> 00:05:35.606
Before I go, can I have ramyeon
down in the kitchen?

00:05:41.112 --> 00:05:42.822
LAWYER KANG SEON-HO

00:05:51.914 --> 00:05:54.125
INCOMING CALL
CHA SU-YEON

00:05:57.879 --> 00:05:59.922
PETITION FOR LENIENCY FOR SEON U-YEONG

00:06:09.473 --> 00:06:11.058
INCOMING CALL
CHA SU-YEON

00:06:15.396 --> 00:06:18.649
It looks like Ms. Cha's calling.
Aren't you going to answer?

00:06:22.236 --> 00:06:27.450
Later. There's a lot to catch up.
It'd be better to do it all at once later.

00:06:38.920 --> 00:06:40.171
What do you think?

00:06:40.880 --> 00:06:45.885
This was written by Lee Hwa-jin,
she even signed it.

00:06:45.968 --> 00:06:47.178
So it must be true.

00:06:47.261 --> 00:06:49.430
"I'm having an affair
with the president-elect

00:06:49.513 --> 00:06:50.681
and carrying his baby."

00:06:50.765 --> 00:06:53.726
That's what Ms. Cha forced her to say
at the interview.

00:06:53.809 --> 00:06:57.813
In return, she promised to argue that
the stolen necklace was actually a gift,

00:06:58.356 --> 00:07:00.858
and to have Seon U-yeong released.

00:07:01.901 --> 00:07:05.696
I told Hwa-jin this
so she'd accept the interview.

00:07:08.449 --> 00:07:10.952
I don't know much about law,

00:07:11.536 --> 00:07:14.622
but doesn't a lawyer have
a confidentiality obligation

00:07:14.705 --> 00:07:15.831
to their client?

00:07:15.915 --> 00:07:19.752
Right. Under Article 26
of the Attorney-at-Law Act,

00:07:19.835 --> 00:07:21.671
lawyers, even former ones, are prohibited

00:07:21.754 --> 00:07:25.633
from disclosing any confidential
information they learn through their work.

00:07:25.716 --> 00:07:27.552
You shouldn't break the law.

00:07:28.970 --> 00:07:30.388
Of course not.

00:07:30.471 --> 00:07:33.349
Ms. Cha hired me,
knowing that from the start.

00:07:34.934 --> 00:07:38.312
She knew I couldn't disclose it
no matter what the secret was,

00:07:38.854 --> 00:07:40.231
and she wanted to use that.

00:07:41.190 --> 00:07:42.733
But I'm not a lawyer anymore.

00:07:43.901 --> 00:07:44.735
What?

00:07:47.863 --> 00:07:50.157
Why did you become a reporter?

00:07:54.495 --> 00:07:55.997
Well…

00:07:56.080 --> 00:07:58.082
There must've been a reason, right?

00:08:00.626 --> 00:08:03.421
There was definitely a reason,

00:08:04.380 --> 00:08:07.174
but it's been so long that I've forgotten.

00:08:08.092 --> 00:08:10.761
I became a lawyer to get

00:08:10.845 --> 00:08:12.597
the special act passed.

00:08:14.015 --> 00:08:17.184
The special act is
being voted on today, right?

00:08:18.853 --> 00:08:21.480
It didn't seem easy.

00:08:24.525 --> 00:08:27.028
It will pass.

00:08:37.371 --> 00:08:39.915
What great weather.

00:08:40.750 --> 00:08:42.835
The sun is nice, and the wind

00:08:44.170 --> 00:08:45.379
is nice too.

00:08:54.847 --> 00:08:56.474
Please comment.

00:08:56.557 --> 00:08:59.602
Why did he visit
the Party for Peace and Freedom?

00:08:59.685 --> 00:09:03.064
The assemblymen are now entering
the plenary chamber,

00:09:03.147 --> 00:09:06.233
as the vote on the special act
is beginning shortly.

00:09:06.317 --> 00:09:09.862
Since the president-elect tried to
convince the Party for Peace and Freedom

00:09:09.945 --> 00:09:11.322
until just before the vote,

00:09:11.405 --> 00:09:14.992
the result is expected to shake up
the nation's political landscape.

00:09:19.080 --> 00:09:21.415
The person you've reached is unavailable.

00:09:21.499 --> 00:09:23.834
You'll be redirected
to voicemail after the beep.

00:09:23.918 --> 00:09:25.419
And charges will be applied.

00:09:26.170 --> 00:09:27.213
Mr. Jo.

00:09:27.713 --> 00:09:29.256
The special act shouldn't pass.

00:09:29.340 --> 00:09:31.092
You're with Assemblyman Han, right?

00:09:31.175 --> 00:09:33.135
Don't enter the chamber.

00:09:33.928 --> 00:09:37.139
If you stop the special act,
I'll do whatever you want.

00:09:37.890 --> 00:09:40.351
We already talked about this with Mr. Noh.

00:09:42.812 --> 00:09:46.190
Do you think I'll just
let you people get away with this?

00:09:46.273 --> 00:09:48.609
You'll all be done for if I start to talk!

00:09:48.693 --> 00:09:51.404
It's only a matter of time
before you lose your badge!

00:09:51.487 --> 00:09:52.738
Not the special act.

00:09:52.822 --> 00:09:54.657
The special act can't be passed!

00:10:01.831 --> 00:10:03.541
MBS REPORTER SON MIN-JU

00:10:14.260 --> 00:10:17.263
ASSEMBLYWOMAN HAN KYUNG-AE
PARTY FOR PEACE AND FREEDOM

00:10:34.363 --> 00:10:35.823
What is it this time?

00:10:36.407 --> 00:10:38.993
Now the case will be
forwarded to the prosecution.

00:10:40.244 --> 00:10:43.998
It seems Seon U-yeong is my last client,

00:10:44.081 --> 00:10:47.460
so I came to take care
of my last case properly.

00:10:50.171 --> 00:10:53.758
It's a petition claiming that Cha Su-yeon
gave a necklace to Lee Hwa-jin,

00:10:53.841 --> 00:10:56.969
who had quit her job as a stylist,
as severance pay.

00:10:58.512 --> 00:11:01.474
And this is a petition claiming that

00:11:01.557 --> 00:11:04.226
Lee Hwa-jin asked Seon U-yeong to sell it

00:11:04.894 --> 00:11:06.228
for her.

00:11:09.982 --> 00:11:13.652
So the theft charge doesn't stand
in the first place.

00:11:17.781 --> 00:11:21.076
If it's forwarded to the prosecution,
this will free him.

00:11:21.994 --> 00:11:22.828
So…

00:11:23.996 --> 00:11:26.040
save yourself the hassle.

00:11:28.125 --> 00:11:30.127
You should've given this to me sooner.

00:11:30.211 --> 00:11:34.173
Look at the date. I'm giving it to you now
because I received it today.

00:11:34.256 --> 00:11:37.009
Ms. Cha is a very busy person, you know.

00:11:41.639 --> 00:11:42.681
By the way,

00:11:44.266 --> 00:11:46.894
the weather is amazing today.

00:11:47.520 --> 00:11:50.814
It's a perfect weather
to be released, isn't it?

00:12:03.452 --> 00:12:06.705
We're interrupting our regular programming
to bring you breaking news.

00:12:06.789 --> 00:12:09.583
The Special Act on the Investigation
of the H Chemical Fire

00:12:09.667 --> 00:12:11.835
and the Establishment of a Safer Society,

00:12:11.919 --> 00:12:14.505
aka the Do Tae-hun Special Act,
has been passed.

00:12:49.039 --> 00:12:52.710
Despite opposition
from the Party for Peace and Freedom,

00:12:52.793 --> 00:12:54.962
the special act has passed

00:12:55.045 --> 00:12:58.340
with 267 votes in favor,
far exceeding the required majority.

00:13:01.510 --> 00:13:02.970
The Do Tae-hun Special Act,

00:13:03.053 --> 00:13:06.015
considered the president-elect's
number one campaign pledge,

00:13:06.098 --> 00:13:08.225
shows the new administration's
strong commitment.

00:13:08.309 --> 00:13:11.061
All eyes are on
whether the truth from 15 years ago

00:13:11.145 --> 00:13:12.771
will finally come to light.

00:13:52.686 --> 00:13:55.606
Hi, Lawyer Song. This is Shin Hae-rin.

00:13:57.566 --> 00:13:58.525
Yes.

00:13:59.109 --> 00:14:00.569
It's all taken care of.

00:14:02.571 --> 00:14:04.031
Nothing has changed.

00:14:04.865 --> 00:14:06.450
Please handle it as discussed.

00:14:28.263 --> 00:14:31.767
There has been no official response yet
from the president-elect.

00:14:31.850 --> 00:14:34.895
We'll bring it to you
as soon as it's released.

00:14:37.106 --> 00:14:38.857
-Mr. Hyun!
-Mr. Hyun!

00:14:45.572 --> 00:14:47.199
-Hyun Min-cheol!
-Hyun Min-cheol!

00:14:47.282 --> 00:14:50.202
-Hyun Min-cheol!
-Hyun Min-cheol!

00:14:50.285 --> 00:14:52.997
-Hyun Min-cheol!
-Hyun Min-cheol!

00:14:53.080 --> 00:14:55.165
Congratulations on
getting the special act passed.

00:14:55.249 --> 00:14:57.626
You worked so hard for it!

00:14:57.710 --> 00:14:59.628
-Good job!
-Good job!

00:15:02.589 --> 00:15:05.009
It's all thanks to you.

00:15:11.849 --> 00:15:15.227
Leave the phones,
and please go home early today.

00:15:16.228 --> 00:15:18.105
Since the special act has been passed,

00:15:18.188 --> 00:15:20.482
we're going to be even busier
from tomorrow.

00:15:20.566 --> 00:15:21.734
Good job, everyone.

00:15:25.946 --> 00:15:27.281
We'll work even harder!

00:15:35.914 --> 00:15:38.125
-We'll work even harder!
-Thank you!

00:15:39.126 --> 00:15:40.419
Secretary Lee.

00:15:40.502 --> 00:15:42.629
Are you crying?

00:15:42.713 --> 00:15:44.131
No, I'm not crying.

00:15:45.799 --> 00:15:47.217
No, really. I'm not crying.

00:15:47.301 --> 00:15:49.553
-Really?
-No.

00:15:49.636 --> 00:15:51.638
I'm really not crying.

00:15:51.722 --> 00:15:53.140
My eyes are just sweaty.

00:15:53.223 --> 00:15:54.266
Oh, come on.

00:15:54.349 --> 00:15:55.476
-Get him a tissue.
-No.

00:15:55.559 --> 00:15:57.227
-Get him a tissue.
-I'm really not crying.

00:15:57.311 --> 00:15:59.104
Come on. Don't cry.

00:15:59.188 --> 00:16:00.522
Don't cry.

00:16:10.074 --> 00:16:12.826
Sir, are you okay?

00:16:15.037 --> 00:16:16.205
Do I look okay to you?

00:16:21.543 --> 00:16:24.213
Don't you have to go see a doctor?

00:16:31.220 --> 00:16:33.472
Come here.

00:16:35.140 --> 00:16:36.141
I told you

00:16:36.225 --> 00:16:38.852
to keep an eye on the president-elect!

00:16:38.936 --> 00:16:40.145
Didn't I?

00:16:48.153 --> 00:16:49.530
I'm sorry.

00:16:50.906 --> 00:16:52.449
I'm sorry, sir.

00:16:56.203 --> 00:16:58.163
MBS NEWS MAGAZINE
WILL START SHORTLY AT 7 P.M.

00:17:07.881 --> 00:17:10.759
Is this really newsworthy?
The special act passed today.

00:17:10.843 --> 00:17:12.761
Everyone's covering the follow-up on that.

00:17:12.845 --> 00:17:15.389
We'll be the only one
talking about Cha's stylist.

00:17:17.099 --> 00:17:18.058
That's right.

00:17:18.142 --> 00:17:20.144
Now, they'll form
a special investigation committee

00:17:20.227 --> 00:17:23.063
and the truth from 15 years ago
will come to light.

00:17:23.772 --> 00:17:26.150
The world moves slowly,

00:17:26.233 --> 00:17:28.902
but it heads in the right direction.

00:17:29.570 --> 00:17:31.113
But none of that's for today.

00:17:31.196 --> 00:17:33.490
You're talking like some hermit.

00:17:35.367 --> 00:17:36.577
Don't worry.

00:17:37.077 --> 00:17:38.954
Today's episode's going to be fun.

00:18:12.946 --> 00:18:14.907
WE PROMISE SINCERITY!

00:18:14.990 --> 00:18:16.992
WIFE

00:18:28.879 --> 00:18:30.923
Now you're stealing?

00:18:33.300 --> 00:18:34.384
Let's talk in person.

00:18:35.010 --> 00:18:37.054
Should I come to you,
or do you want to come over?

00:18:38.055 --> 00:18:39.431
You…

00:18:40.891 --> 00:18:42.559
I'll come to you. Wait for me.

00:18:58.283 --> 00:18:59.409
One second.

00:19:01.161 --> 00:19:02.204
Hello?

00:19:02.996 --> 00:19:03.997
Mr. Kang.

00:19:04.498 --> 00:19:07.501
Are you in the broadcasting station now?

00:19:07.584 --> 00:19:09.378
Yes, in the green room.

00:19:10.128 --> 00:19:12.256
I think I found the room.

00:19:12.339 --> 00:19:13.340
Hang on a second.

00:19:20.138 --> 00:19:21.139
Mr. Kang.

00:19:23.141 --> 00:19:24.643
I have something to tell you.

00:19:25.852 --> 00:19:27.896
Could you leave us alone for a second?

00:19:27.980 --> 00:19:29.273
Sure.

00:19:37.322 --> 00:19:39.366
What is it you want to tell me?

00:19:43.078 --> 00:19:44.538
Hwa-jin.

00:19:45.122 --> 00:19:46.623
I lied.

00:19:47.541 --> 00:19:49.084
I lied to you.

00:19:51.378 --> 00:19:52.379
What do you mean?

00:19:52.462 --> 00:19:55.799
Whether you do the interview or not,
U-yeong was supposed to be freed.

00:19:56.717 --> 00:19:58.593
All we needed was the petition.

00:20:01.096 --> 00:20:04.975
Then why did you tell me that
I had to do the interview to free him?

00:20:07.769 --> 00:20:09.229
I was

00:20:10.564 --> 00:20:11.773
using you, Hwa-jin.

00:20:13.567 --> 00:20:14.443
Why?

00:20:18.405 --> 00:20:19.573
There must be a reason.

00:20:20.574 --> 00:20:24.494
Doing this interview will
put both you and U-yeong in trouble.

00:20:24.578 --> 00:20:26.496
So don't do the interview.

00:20:26.580 --> 00:20:28.165
I'll take care of the rest.

00:20:30.500 --> 00:20:31.918
Come on. Stand up now.

00:20:32.002 --> 00:20:33.337
The reason.

00:20:34.796 --> 00:20:36.006
You didn't tell me.

00:20:37.924 --> 00:20:39.176
There is

00:20:40.469 --> 00:20:41.678
no time.

00:20:41.762 --> 00:20:45.098
I need to know the reason
to decide whether I do it or not.

00:20:50.062 --> 00:20:52.481
Have you hated someone so much
you wanted to kill them?

00:20:54.775 --> 00:20:55.901
I have.

00:20:57.652 --> 00:20:59.780
At first, it was Do Tae-hun, the dead man.

00:20:59.863 --> 00:21:00.906
Then,

00:21:00.989 --> 00:21:03.325
it was the person who framed him.

00:21:04.034 --> 00:21:05.702
It was Ms. Cha.

00:21:08.955 --> 00:21:11.541
What did she frame him for?

00:21:13.668 --> 00:21:15.420
For killing my parents.

00:21:18.715 --> 00:21:20.467
That's why I lied to you.

00:21:20.550 --> 00:21:22.344
I wanted to use you

00:21:23.637 --> 00:21:25.847
to take my revenge on her.

00:21:27.182 --> 00:21:29.309
You must've really hated her.

00:21:37.484 --> 00:21:40.487
You asked if I've hated someone
so much I wanted to kill them.

00:21:42.739 --> 00:21:43.782
I have…

00:21:46.243 --> 00:21:47.661
killed someone.

00:21:57.754 --> 00:21:59.131
Ten minutes until the show.

00:21:59.214 --> 00:22:00.841
Please stand by in the studio.

00:22:02.717 --> 00:22:05.137
Wait, Hwa-jin. It's not too late yet.

00:22:09.266 --> 00:22:10.559
Please follow me.

00:22:12.519 --> 00:22:13.603
Hwa-jin.

00:22:18.984 --> 00:22:20.110
Don't worry.

00:22:20.944 --> 00:22:23.655
U-yeong will never be arrested again.

00:22:57.689 --> 00:22:59.316
Did you look through the questions?

00:23:01.026 --> 00:23:03.945
We'll take it slow, so don't worry.

00:23:04.613 --> 00:23:07.365
Remember what we talked about earlier?

00:23:07.449 --> 00:23:09.910
Just think this is a replay of that.

00:23:12.829 --> 00:23:14.956
Where's the camera I should be looking at?

00:23:15.040 --> 00:23:17.334
Oh, you can just look at me.

00:23:17.959 --> 00:23:21.838
You need to act naturally
for the viewers to be convinced.

00:23:21.922 --> 00:23:23.048
That's most crucial.

00:23:24.507 --> 00:23:25.508
Okay.

00:23:26.551 --> 00:23:28.803
Thirty seconds until the intro.

00:23:42.025 --> 00:23:43.068
Dad.

00:23:45.237 --> 00:23:46.112
Hey.

00:23:46.988 --> 00:23:48.323
Have you had dinner yet?

00:23:49.824 --> 00:23:52.202
You should've given me a heads-up.

00:23:52.285 --> 00:23:54.120
We just had dinner.

00:24:00.168 --> 00:24:02.879
Ji-yu, can we talk a little bit later?

00:24:02.963 --> 00:24:04.631
I need to talk to your mom first.

00:24:10.679 --> 00:24:11.972
Okay.

00:24:40.542 --> 00:24:41.751
Would you like a drink?

00:24:43.962 --> 00:24:45.672
Your usual tea?

00:24:46.423 --> 00:24:47.340
Ma'am.

00:24:48.550 --> 00:24:49.968
Could you bring us some wine?

00:24:53.930 --> 00:24:57.142
The special act you wanted so badly
has been passed.

00:24:58.184 --> 00:25:00.353
We should have a toast, don't you think?

00:25:04.566 --> 00:25:06.234
I'll bring one right away.

00:25:13.575 --> 00:25:14.534
When was it?

00:25:15.827 --> 00:25:17.537
I'm talking about Lawyer Kang.

00:25:18.204 --> 00:25:20.749
I doubt
he was on your side from the start.

00:25:23.001 --> 00:25:24.669
What did you offer in return

00:25:24.753 --> 00:25:26.296
to make him steal it?

00:25:28.923 --> 00:25:30.008
Right.

00:25:30.633 --> 00:25:32.135
Was he also

00:25:32.761 --> 00:25:34.679
going for the special act?

00:25:41.853 --> 00:25:43.396
I'll answer all your questions.

00:25:43.480 --> 00:25:45.231
What happened

00:25:45.899 --> 00:25:47.609
and everything.

00:25:47.692 --> 00:25:49.194
Everything you want to know.

00:25:51.112 --> 00:25:52.322
And in return,

00:25:53.573 --> 00:25:54.783
answer this one question.

00:25:54.866 --> 00:25:56.284
What is it?

00:25:56.368 --> 00:25:58.661
Why were you
so strongly against the special act?

00:26:00.830 --> 00:26:02.040
Just tell me that.

00:26:11.716 --> 00:26:13.301
It's not what you think.

00:26:15.178 --> 00:26:17.055
You just needed to trust me.

00:26:17.847 --> 00:26:20.809
Just like you always have,
you should've trusted me.

00:26:20.892 --> 00:26:22.477
But you chose

00:26:23.436 --> 00:26:25.063
the special act over me.

00:26:25.146 --> 00:26:26.689
That's not what happened.

00:26:27.357 --> 00:26:29.567
It wasn't about choosing or not choosing.

00:26:29.651 --> 00:26:30.985
You…

00:26:31.694 --> 00:26:33.071
never change.

00:26:33.613 --> 00:26:35.115
You can't give up on anyone.

00:26:36.032 --> 00:26:39.285
No matter how much I tell you
what helps you win,

00:26:39.369 --> 00:26:40.662
you just won't listen.

00:26:40.745 --> 00:26:42.038
Because

00:26:42.997 --> 00:26:45.708
you went into politics
just for that one person.

00:26:45.792 --> 00:26:48.128
You think politics is
all about that one person!

00:26:48.211 --> 00:26:50.964
If you knew that,
why did you go against it so hard?

00:27:24.622 --> 00:27:27.000
Now it's passed,
you'll find out eventually.

00:27:28.626 --> 00:27:31.713
That's why you were so determined
to get it passed, right?

00:27:31.796 --> 00:27:32.881
That's right.

00:27:34.924 --> 00:27:37.135
But I want to hear it from you.

00:27:39.220 --> 00:27:40.763
The truth of that day.

00:27:50.773 --> 00:27:51.816
Mom! Lee Hwa-jin is…

00:27:53.109 --> 00:27:54.777
Lee Hwa-jin is on TV!

00:27:54.861 --> 00:27:55.778
What?

00:27:56.988 --> 00:27:58.323
She's on TV now.

00:28:01.826 --> 00:28:04.454
Today, we have a special guest here.

00:28:04.537 --> 00:28:06.539
LEE HWA-JIN
CHA SU-YEON'S STYLIST

00:28:13.546 --> 00:28:15.465
Lee Hwa-jin will come forward herself.

00:28:15.548 --> 00:28:17.967
And say the baby is yours.

00:28:20.803 --> 00:28:21.804
You didn't…

00:28:21.888 --> 00:28:24.349
No, I didn't do this.

00:28:24.933 --> 00:28:28.728
We've received a shocking tip alleging
that Ms. Cha Su-yeon framed someone

00:28:28.811 --> 00:28:32.565
as the president-elect's affair partner
and forced her into a false interview.

00:28:33.066 --> 00:28:37.070
Ms. Lee Hwa-jin,
who provided the tip, is here with me now.

00:28:38.988 --> 00:28:42.450
Thanks for coming.
It must've been a hard decision.

00:28:43.284 --> 00:28:45.286
First, could you introduce yourself?

00:28:53.169 --> 00:28:55.880
What's wrong with the guest?
Is she frozen?

00:28:57.841 --> 00:29:00.260
Come on.
This is going to mess up the show.

00:29:00.343 --> 00:29:01.719
Reporter Son, do something.

00:29:08.935 --> 00:29:10.728
SHOCKING TRUTH BEHIND THE NEXT FIRST LADY!

00:29:13.982 --> 00:29:15.483
Damn it. Dead air.

00:29:15.567 --> 00:29:16.860
-Cut the feed.
-Hold on.

00:29:22.532 --> 00:29:23.533
Ms. Lee.

00:29:24.409 --> 00:29:27.704
I understand this can be stressful.

00:29:27.787 --> 00:29:30.707
But you took the courage to come this far.

00:29:30.790 --> 00:29:34.294
So please tell the viewers your story.

00:29:50.560 --> 00:29:51.603
I am…

00:29:53.897 --> 00:29:57.275
President-elect Hyun Min-cheol's daughter.

00:30:07.952 --> 00:30:10.038
I thought I didn't have a father,

00:30:10.121 --> 00:30:12.290
but I recently learned that I had one.

00:30:13.958 --> 00:30:14.959
Ms. Lee.

00:30:16.044 --> 00:30:19.464
Are you saying
you're the president-elect's daughter?

00:30:22.216 --> 00:30:23.217
Yes.

00:30:24.928 --> 00:30:25.762
That's right.

00:30:27.555 --> 00:30:29.098
What was it called?

00:30:29.849 --> 00:30:32.268
Ms. Cha told me.

00:30:32.977 --> 00:30:34.562
Oh, I remember now.

00:30:35.813 --> 00:30:37.231
An illegitimate child.

00:30:39.734 --> 00:30:42.153
The president-elect's illegitimate child.

00:30:43.071 --> 00:30:45.365
You said you learned about it recently.

00:30:45.448 --> 00:30:49.577
When and how exactly
did you learn about it?

00:30:50.161 --> 00:30:52.288
It was at the funeral on the election day.

00:30:53.206 --> 00:30:54.540
At the funeral?

00:30:55.208 --> 00:30:57.627
Whose funeral was it?

00:30:57.710 --> 00:30:59.629
That's what I asked too.

00:31:00.463 --> 00:31:01.714
"Who is she?"

00:31:04.300 --> 00:31:06.594
LATE EOM SUN-JEONG

00:32:04.444 --> 00:32:05.903
Who is she?

00:32:06.487 --> 00:32:08.072
What is she to you?

00:32:08.656 --> 00:32:09.949
This pendant.

00:32:11.576 --> 00:32:13.661
You said your friend gave it to you.

00:32:15.621 --> 00:32:16.497
Yes.

00:32:16.581 --> 00:32:18.082
She's that friend's mom.

00:32:27.383 --> 00:32:28.426
But…

00:32:30.219 --> 00:32:31.763
you didn't tell me

00:32:32.346 --> 00:32:33.473
what she was to you.

00:32:37.060 --> 00:32:38.811
She's someone…

00:32:42.190 --> 00:32:43.816
I had to meet again at least once.

00:32:44.817 --> 00:32:46.444
But I was too late.

00:32:47.028 --> 00:32:48.780
I came too far.

00:32:53.618 --> 00:32:54.786
That friend.

00:32:56.746 --> 00:32:58.206
You said she died, right?

00:33:07.757 --> 00:33:09.634
Five years ago in a road accident.

00:33:11.594 --> 00:33:14.639
She was on a motorcycle, and it slipped.

00:33:52.301 --> 00:33:53.469
What is it?

00:33:54.262 --> 00:33:56.097
Why are you looking at me like that?

00:33:58.850 --> 00:33:59.976
It's nothing.

00:34:01.102 --> 00:34:03.771
By the way,
what happened between you and Ji-yu?

00:34:03.855 --> 00:34:05.773
There seems to be a big misunderstanding.

00:34:05.857 --> 00:34:07.525
It's because of the pendant.

00:34:08.317 --> 00:34:11.195
I don't know if she was joking,
but she refused to return it.

00:34:12.572 --> 00:34:13.573
I see.

00:34:14.657 --> 00:34:16.742
Anyway, why here?

00:34:16.826 --> 00:34:19.495
Why did you bring me here?

00:34:20.454 --> 00:34:21.706
I have a favor to ask.

00:34:25.293 --> 00:34:26.752
Can you stay here

00:34:27.962 --> 00:34:30.256
for the next three days
until the funeral's over.

00:34:31.799 --> 00:34:32.800
Why?

00:34:35.469 --> 00:34:37.180
If she's here all alone,

00:34:38.389 --> 00:34:40.183
she might feel very lonely.

00:34:42.310 --> 00:34:44.645
She had a very lonely life.

00:34:46.063 --> 00:34:47.815
Her daughter's friend staying here

00:34:49.108 --> 00:34:51.861
will be better than
a complete stranger doing it.

00:35:03.789 --> 00:35:05.041
Is there really

00:35:06.709 --> 00:35:09.128
no one to do it for her?

00:35:11.214 --> 00:35:12.506
There used to,

00:35:13.341 --> 00:35:14.425
but they're gone now.

00:35:17.220 --> 00:35:19.513
One friend died because of me.

00:35:22.558 --> 00:35:23.893
And the other friend is

00:35:25.269 --> 00:35:27.563
in the police station because of me.

00:35:28.314 --> 00:35:29.523
That's all?

00:35:30.858 --> 00:35:32.693
She had someone whom she called mom.

00:35:40.201 --> 00:35:42.161
She was a mother figure to her.

00:35:44.914 --> 00:35:47.541
But if she comes here,
she'll be too devastated.

00:35:55.758 --> 00:35:56.634
I'll do it.

00:36:00.137 --> 00:36:02.848
But pay me three days' worth of wages.

00:36:05.977 --> 00:36:07.520
I'll let Secretary Shin know.

00:36:08.521 --> 00:36:09.563
And

00:36:10.356 --> 00:36:11.607
I'll pay for the ring too.

00:36:14.318 --> 00:36:17.321
But you said it was a present from you.

00:36:17.405 --> 00:36:18.990
If Min-jeong gave it to you,

00:36:19.573 --> 00:36:21.284
it belongs to you now, not me.

00:36:22.451 --> 00:36:23.619
So take it.

00:36:24.662 --> 00:36:25.830
"Min-jeong"?

00:36:25.913 --> 00:36:27.832
The friend who gave you that ring.

00:36:30.418 --> 00:36:32.086
Wasn't her name Min-jeong?

00:36:33.546 --> 00:36:35.798
I never mentioned her name.

00:36:56.277 --> 00:36:59.196
Does President-elect know about this too?

00:37:00.489 --> 00:37:02.408
Did you tell him you're his daughter?

00:37:04.869 --> 00:37:06.579
I didn't have time to tell him.

00:37:07.413 --> 00:37:08.456
Why?

00:37:08.539 --> 00:37:10.291
Ms. Cha got the wrong idea

00:37:11.000 --> 00:37:13.919
that I was having an affair
with the president-elect.

00:37:14.587 --> 00:37:16.130
Did you tell her she was wrong?

00:37:16.213 --> 00:37:18.382
Of course I told her it was nonsense.

00:37:18.966 --> 00:37:22.470
But she didn't think so.

00:37:22.553 --> 00:37:26.640
She thought others would also
get the wrong idea about our relationship

00:37:26.724 --> 00:37:29.185
and tried to claim
I was Mr. Hyun's mistress.

00:37:36.901 --> 00:37:39.236
I don't really understand.

00:37:39.320 --> 00:37:44.367
You didn't say anything when you were
accused of being Mr. Hyun's mistress.

00:37:44.450 --> 00:37:46.952
Why are you revealing the truth now?

00:37:47.036 --> 00:37:50.456
Why are you announcing it so publicly?

00:38:12.645 --> 00:38:15.314
To find the hit-and-run offender
who killed my mom.

00:38:16.190 --> 00:38:19.485
It's been two months,
and they've yet to catch the offender.

00:38:20.903 --> 00:38:23.531
That's why I'm revealing
that I'm Mr. Hyun's daughter.

00:38:24.365 --> 00:38:26.033
It'll get on the news this way,

00:38:27.076 --> 00:38:28.911
and I'll be able to find witnesses.

00:38:31.705 --> 00:38:33.416
I want to find the person

00:38:34.708 --> 00:38:36.752
who killed my mom.

00:39:01.569 --> 00:39:03.779
Mom, what was she talking about?

00:39:06.574 --> 00:39:07.575
Dad.

00:39:09.034 --> 00:39:10.744
Is what Hwa-jin said true?

00:39:10.828 --> 00:39:12.496
Is she really your daughter?

00:39:16.125 --> 00:39:18.544
Answer me! Is it true?

00:39:23.883 --> 00:39:26.760
Ma'am, please take Ji-yu to her room.

00:39:26.844 --> 00:39:28.220
Yes, ma'am.

00:39:28.804 --> 00:39:30.139
Why won't you answer me?

00:39:34.518 --> 00:39:35.853
Is what Hwa-jin said true?

00:39:37.897 --> 00:39:39.857
Is she really your daughter?

00:39:46.947 --> 00:39:49.492
Mom, say something.

00:39:53.329 --> 00:39:54.163
Let's go.

00:39:57.750 --> 00:39:58.876
You're the worst.

00:40:00.252 --> 00:40:02.296
You two are the same.

00:40:03.506 --> 00:40:05.132
You're the worst.

00:40:21.232 --> 00:40:22.441
When did you

00:40:24.235 --> 00:40:25.986
find out about this?

00:40:28.906 --> 00:40:30.074
I had a guess.

00:40:30.157 --> 00:40:31.784
At the funeral,

00:40:32.910 --> 00:40:33.953
as she claims?

00:40:34.787 --> 00:40:35.788
No.

00:40:38.707 --> 00:40:41.335
On the day I saw the ring on her pendant.

00:40:52.721 --> 00:40:53.931
That ring…

00:40:54.515 --> 00:40:55.516
Pardon?

00:40:59.270 --> 00:41:00.104
This?

00:41:00.688 --> 00:41:01.772
Can I

00:41:03.232 --> 00:41:04.441
have a look?

00:41:28.465 --> 00:41:30.884
What's wrong?

00:41:42.313 --> 00:41:43.897
SECRETARY LEE BEOM-SEOK

00:41:47.443 --> 00:41:49.236
Yes, I'll head out now.

00:41:55.826 --> 00:41:57.077
I forgot to take this.

00:41:58.203 --> 00:42:01.290
I should've packed it. I forgot.

00:42:03.792 --> 00:42:06.045
Let's talk on the way. I'm running late.

00:42:06.879 --> 00:42:08.547
Oh, okay.

00:42:19.808 --> 00:42:22.603
When I asked how she got the ring,
she said

00:42:23.187 --> 00:42:24.897
her friend had gifted it to her.

00:42:26.482 --> 00:42:28.400
And that friend was dead.

00:42:29.818 --> 00:42:33.280
That means Lee Hwa-jin is lying.

00:42:33.364 --> 00:42:35.658
She could be passing off
as her dead friend.

00:42:35.741 --> 00:42:36.659
No.

00:42:37.409 --> 00:42:38.911
I don't know why,

00:42:40.746 --> 00:42:42.331
but she lied to me.

00:42:43.457 --> 00:42:45.292
Sun-jeong was the same.

00:42:46.043 --> 00:42:47.670
What do you mean, the same?

00:42:47.753 --> 00:42:49.755
She would faint every now and then,

00:42:50.923 --> 00:42:52.508
just like Hwa-jin.

00:42:59.056 --> 00:43:00.599
It's often hereditary.

00:43:00.683 --> 00:43:04.812
For example, if the mom has the symptom,
the daughter has it too.

00:43:09.108 --> 00:43:10.484
So I was always concerned.

00:43:10.567 --> 00:43:11.694
No.

00:43:13.821 --> 00:43:15.322
You just want to believe it.

00:43:16.573 --> 00:43:20.703
You just want to believe that
the child you've never met is still alive.

00:43:21.245 --> 00:43:23.872
Hwa-jin is assuming
the dead girl was your daughter

00:43:23.956 --> 00:43:26.083
and is simply spouting nonsense,

00:43:26.166 --> 00:43:28.210
and you just want to believe her.

00:43:34.466 --> 00:43:35.968
Twenty years ago,

00:43:37.928 --> 00:43:40.264
when Sun-jeong left, I had this thought.

00:43:43.183 --> 00:43:44.768
That it might be you

00:43:46.979 --> 00:43:48.689
that made her leave.

00:43:51.066 --> 00:43:52.609
Why bring that up now--

00:43:52.693 --> 00:43:54.403
Like how you chased Ki-ju away,

00:43:56.739 --> 00:43:58.907
you might've chased Sun-jeong away.

00:44:01.493 --> 00:44:02.911
Was it you?

00:44:05.748 --> 00:44:07.750
Did you force Sun-jeong to leave?

00:44:13.255 --> 00:44:15.215
Did you know

00:44:18.385 --> 00:44:19.845
she was pregnant?

00:44:30.272 --> 00:44:32.316
Let's do a paternity test.

00:44:32.858 --> 00:44:33.901
That comes first.

00:44:55.464 --> 00:44:56.465
I think

00:44:57.591 --> 00:44:59.635
we need to talk, don't you think?

00:45:02.513 --> 00:45:05.474
This is totally messed up.

00:45:07.392 --> 00:45:08.852
Is this really okay?

00:45:11.438 --> 00:45:13.524
You said today's news would be fun.

00:45:13.607 --> 00:45:14.608
This is impressive.

00:45:15.108 --> 00:45:18.445
Was it a surprise?
I thought it was going to be a blooper.

00:45:18.529 --> 00:45:21.615
I told you
we'd definitely get the upcoming show,

00:45:21.698 --> 00:45:23.200
didn't I?

00:45:27.329 --> 00:45:28.830
Are you serious right now?

00:45:28.914 --> 00:45:33.377
We almost took Cha Su-yeon's word for it
and reported her as Mr. Hyun's mistress.

00:45:33.460 --> 00:45:35.629
If what Lee Hwa-jin claims is true,

00:45:35.712 --> 00:45:38.549
we almost made a false report
of them having an affair!

00:45:38.632 --> 00:45:40.926
That would've been a disaster.

00:45:41.009 --> 00:45:42.010
A disaster that

00:45:42.094 --> 00:45:44.304
would've destroyed a person, no, a family.

00:45:44.388 --> 00:45:45.430
And you're talking

00:45:46.181 --> 00:45:47.224
about the next show?

00:45:47.808 --> 00:45:48.684
But it didn't happen.

00:45:54.773 --> 00:45:56.817
What's with her? She was fine just now.

00:45:56.900 --> 00:45:58.902
-Shame on you!
-Hyun Min-cheol!

00:45:58.986 --> 00:46:00.862
-You don't deserve it!
-Hyun Min-cheol!

00:46:00.946 --> 00:46:02.906
-Step down!
-Hyun Min-cheol!

00:46:02.990 --> 00:46:04.783
-Shame on you!
-Hyun Min-cheol!

00:46:04.866 --> 00:46:06.952
-You're an embarrassment!
-Hyun Min-cheol!

00:46:07.035 --> 00:46:10.664
Before he could enjoy the excitement
of getting the special act passed,

00:46:10.747 --> 00:46:14.585
the president-elect is facing a scandal
involving an illegitimate child.

00:46:14.668 --> 00:46:15.836
That's his car.

00:46:15.919 --> 00:46:18.255
-He's here!
-He's here!

00:46:20.090 --> 00:46:21.758
Step down, Hyun Min-cheol!

00:46:21.842 --> 00:46:23.385
-Step down!
-Step down!

00:46:23.468 --> 00:46:25.345
Step down, Hyun Min-cheol!

00:46:25.429 --> 00:46:26.597
-Step down!
-Step down!

00:46:26.680 --> 00:46:28.599
Step down, Hyun Min-cheol!

00:46:28.682 --> 00:46:30.434
-Step down!
-Step down!

00:46:30.517 --> 00:46:32.436
Step down, Hyun Min-cheol!

00:46:32.519 --> 00:46:34.563
Contrary to the prediction

00:46:34.646 --> 00:46:37.149
that he'd refrain
from responding officially,

00:46:37.232 --> 00:46:39.568
the president-elect showed up himself.

00:46:39.651 --> 00:46:41.278
-Step down!
-Step down!

00:46:41.361 --> 00:46:42.863
Step down!

00:46:42.946 --> 00:46:44.364
-Step down!
-Step down!

00:46:44.448 --> 00:46:45.782
Is what she said true?

00:46:45.866 --> 00:46:47.784
Is Ms. Lee Hwa-jin your daughter?

00:46:47.868 --> 00:46:50.329
People are demanding a paternity test.

00:46:50.412 --> 00:46:51.663
Will you agree to it?

00:46:54.458 --> 00:46:56.585
STEP DOWN, GET LOST

00:46:56.668 --> 00:47:00.631
STEP DOWN, HYUN MIN-CHEOL

00:47:09.723 --> 00:47:11.016
Ask me again.

00:47:11.099 --> 00:47:14.603
Some are demanding
a paternity test regarding this issue.

00:47:17.773 --> 00:47:19.274
I need her consent

00:47:19.775 --> 00:47:21.735
to do a paternity test.

00:47:21.818 --> 00:47:25.364
I'm asking about your willingness.
Are you willing to take the test?

00:47:25.447 --> 00:47:28.825
If that's what the people want,
I will take the test.

00:47:28.909 --> 00:47:32.412
What will you do if the test result says
she is your daughter?

00:47:32.496 --> 00:47:34.122
Take responsibility!

00:47:34.206 --> 00:47:35.874
Take responsibility!

00:47:35.957 --> 00:47:37.501
Take responsibility!

00:47:37.584 --> 00:47:39.127
Take responsibility!

00:47:39.211 --> 00:47:42.506
I will take responsibility
if the situation calls for it.

00:47:42.589 --> 00:47:45.384
What kind of responsibility
are you talking about?

00:47:48.720 --> 00:47:51.223
A responsibility as a father.

00:47:58.188 --> 00:48:00.357
But my responsibility for the nation

00:48:01.358 --> 00:48:03.402
and its people is just as important.

00:48:04.903 --> 00:48:06.321
What's important now

00:48:06.863 --> 00:48:09.116
is the special act
for the people's safety.

00:48:09.199 --> 00:48:11.368
-Boo!
-Boo!

00:48:11.451 --> 00:48:12.869
Step down!

00:48:12.953 --> 00:48:14.413
-Step down!
-Step down!

00:48:14.496 --> 00:48:17.332
The committee
with investigation and prosecution rights

00:48:17.416 --> 00:48:19.334
is being formed in the wrong way.

00:48:19.418 --> 00:48:21.753
Kim Jeong-taek, Chair of the committee,

00:48:21.837 --> 00:48:25.757
is the CEO of the law firm which recently
merged with the law firm appointed

00:48:25.841 --> 00:48:27.467
for H Group's illegal succession.

00:48:27.551 --> 00:48:29.678
Vice Chairman Shim Yun-seop

00:48:29.761 --> 00:48:34.015
caused controversy by defining
the workers on strike as terrorists.

00:48:34.599 --> 00:48:36.727
The special act is to uncover the truth

00:48:37.894 --> 00:48:41.106
of the fire
and stop tragic accidents from recurring.

00:48:41.189 --> 00:48:45.235
Thus, the current committee members
must be reconsidered to support the act.

00:48:45.318 --> 00:48:46.820
Step down, Hyun Min-cheol!

00:48:46.903 --> 00:48:48.488
-Step down!
-Step down!

00:48:48.572 --> 00:48:50.031
Step down, Hyun Min-cheol!

00:48:50.115 --> 00:48:51.992
President-elect, you should go in.

00:48:52.075 --> 00:48:53.285
President Yu,

00:48:54.119 --> 00:48:56.037
prior to the special investigation,

00:48:56.121 --> 00:48:59.374
started sealing up the relevant documents
as presidential records.

00:48:59.458 --> 00:49:01.585
To uncover the truth,

00:49:01.668 --> 00:49:05.922
we need
your constant attention and monitoring.

00:49:11.720 --> 00:49:13.430
You should go in.

00:49:13.513 --> 00:49:14.848
We'll continue next time.

00:49:14.931 --> 00:49:16.516
-Step down!
-Step down!

00:49:16.600 --> 00:49:18.268
Step down, Hyun Min-cheol!

00:49:18.351 --> 00:49:19.644
-Step down!
-Step down!

00:49:19.728 --> 00:49:23.315
President-elect emphasized
the neutrality of the committee members

00:49:23.398 --> 00:49:25.442
and the independence of the committee.

00:49:25.525 --> 00:49:28.820
But it is being overshadowed
by the illegitimate child scandal.

00:49:28.904 --> 00:49:31.948
Some protesters are
demanding his resignation

00:49:32.032 --> 00:49:33.533
and even using violence,

00:49:33.617 --> 00:49:35.911
alluding to severe chaos.

00:49:42.459 --> 00:49:45.545
Sis. She's toying with us.

00:49:50.801 --> 00:49:51.635
Was it you?

00:49:52.344 --> 00:49:53.178
What?

00:49:53.970 --> 00:49:56.097
Hwa-jin's interview.

00:49:56.765 --> 00:49:57.933
Did you get her to do it?

00:50:01.144 --> 00:50:02.145
Did you pay her?

00:50:04.523 --> 00:50:05.941
Calm down.

00:50:06.608 --> 00:50:07.609
It wasn't me.

00:50:10.529 --> 00:50:11.863
Were you aware of it too?

00:50:11.947 --> 00:50:13.615
The illegitimate child issue?

00:50:15.367 --> 00:50:19.204
The blood test result the nurse gave me.

00:50:20.497 --> 00:50:22.374
Hwa-jin is Rh-negative.

00:50:24.000 --> 00:50:25.502
So is Ji-yu, right?

00:50:28.255 --> 00:50:31.007
That's uncommon in Korea.

00:50:31.091 --> 00:50:35.178
Between 0.15 to 0.3 percent.

00:50:35.262 --> 00:50:37.138
And I'm good at math.

00:50:37.722 --> 00:50:41.393
That's about two out of a thousand people
with that percentage.

00:50:42.519 --> 00:50:45.939
The doctor and the nurse
weren't surprised by her pregnancy.

00:50:46.022 --> 00:50:48.608
Only two out of a thousand
are Rh-negative,

00:50:48.692 --> 00:50:51.319
and two of them were rushed
to the hospital together.

00:50:51.403 --> 00:50:52.946
Of course they were surprised.

00:50:54.906 --> 00:50:56.658
So you're not 100% sure.

00:50:56.741 --> 00:50:58.118
That doesn't matter.

00:50:59.160 --> 00:51:00.704
We'll just carry on as is.

00:51:02.497 --> 00:51:04.457
The special act's been passed.

00:51:05.250 --> 00:51:08.128
I counted on you.

00:51:08.962 --> 00:51:11.172
You've no idea
how disappointed I am in you.

00:51:12.340 --> 00:51:15.969
The ledger you used like a family heirloom
has become useless now.

00:51:16.052 --> 00:51:18.763
The few committee members
that are on my side

00:51:18.847 --> 00:51:20.682
are our only barricades now.

00:51:20.765 --> 00:51:23.268
First, we need to appease
the public criticisms

00:51:23.351 --> 00:51:25.478
about the committee member appointments.

00:51:25.562 --> 00:51:29.691
I was looking high and low
for something that could do that.

00:51:29.774 --> 00:51:32.777
And at this crucial time,

00:51:33.820 --> 00:51:37.324
she drew in everyone's attention
with the illegitimate child scandal.

00:51:38.074 --> 00:51:39.910
We should be grateful, shouldn't we?

00:51:40.493 --> 00:51:44.456
So I'm supporting to the fullest
with the protesters and the media.

00:51:48.001 --> 00:51:49.294
What do you want?

00:51:50.295 --> 00:51:52.505
Why did you ask to meet me?

00:51:55.550 --> 00:51:58.178
Min-cheol said this on TV.

00:51:58.261 --> 00:52:00.889
The paternity test can't be done
without her consent.

00:52:01.890 --> 00:52:04.893
What if the test results say
Lee Hwa-jin isn't his daughter?

00:52:04.976 --> 00:52:06.061
What will happen then?

00:52:06.144 --> 00:52:08.813
The scandal will be gone
despite all my efforts.

00:52:11.441 --> 00:52:14.402
So you're saying I shouldn't try

00:52:15.278 --> 00:52:16.696
to get him to do the test.

00:52:23.703 --> 00:52:25.664
Just in case, you know.

00:52:26.247 --> 00:52:27.374
An illegitimate child.

00:52:28.124 --> 00:52:29.751
Let's keep this issue rolling.

00:52:29.834 --> 00:52:32.587
The assemblymen you controlled
with sticks,

00:52:32.671 --> 00:52:34.589
I'll get them back with carrots.

00:52:35.382 --> 00:52:38.426
They avoided me
when the special act was passed,

00:52:38.510 --> 00:52:41.805
but after this scandal,
they're slowly coming back to me.

00:52:42.305 --> 00:52:44.557
They're messaging me on Telegram, you see.

00:52:45.308 --> 00:52:46.977
Old habits die hard.

00:52:47.560 --> 00:52:48.687
Those scum

00:52:49.437 --> 00:52:50.897
can't refuse my free money.

00:52:51.856 --> 00:52:54.567
So don't do anything, Su-yeon.

00:52:54.651 --> 00:52:57.320
Put your lawsuit on hold for a while too.

00:52:58.321 --> 00:53:00.740
If the paternity test is
accepted as evidence

00:53:00.824 --> 00:53:03.493
and the result isn't what we want,
it'll be our loss.

00:53:04.744 --> 00:53:06.663
The result we want?

00:53:07.914 --> 00:53:10.667
The result you want, you mean.

00:53:11.459 --> 00:53:12.877
Come on.

00:53:12.961 --> 00:53:13.962
Su-yeon!

00:53:14.587 --> 00:53:16.840
I'm so hurt right now.

00:53:17.799 --> 00:53:21.636
We're in the same boat,
at least when it comes to the special act.

00:53:25.390 --> 00:53:28.309
If you get arrested, we all will be.

00:53:29.227 --> 00:53:31.229
If I get arrested, you all will be too.

00:53:36.317 --> 00:53:39.195
HASEONG MEMORIAL PARK

00:54:10.393 --> 00:54:11.352
Mom.

00:54:11.978 --> 00:54:13.772
Let's go now.

00:54:13.855 --> 00:54:15.398
LATE EOM SUN-JEONG

00:54:25.450 --> 00:54:26.618
Was it that day?

00:54:27.410 --> 00:54:30.413
The day you suddenly visited me
and talked about Sun-jeong.

00:54:30.497 --> 00:54:31.748
Was it that day?

00:54:32.499 --> 00:54:34.209
Why didn't you tell me?

00:54:37.504 --> 00:54:38.546
I'm sorry.

00:54:39.923 --> 00:54:41.716
That poor thing.

00:54:43.051 --> 00:54:44.928
If I'd sent her off myself,

00:54:45.011 --> 00:54:49.224
I wouldn't be feeling this devastated.

00:54:50.433 --> 00:54:52.560
And what is it about her daughter?

00:54:53.144 --> 00:54:54.270
Did you know about it?

00:54:57.732 --> 00:54:59.776
Say something.

00:54:59.859 --> 00:55:01.903
Why won't you say anything?

00:55:01.986 --> 00:55:04.155
Mom, stop it.

00:55:04.239 --> 00:55:05.323
Let's go.

00:55:07.659 --> 00:55:08.660
Let's go.

00:55:09.244 --> 00:55:10.453
Goodness.

00:55:11.204 --> 00:55:15.458
Oh, dear. That poor thing.

00:55:47.740 --> 00:55:52.245
YEAR 2007

00:56:04.591 --> 00:56:06.384
-Why're you always holed up here?
-Gosh.

00:56:09.429 --> 00:56:11.764
Is this a ring?

00:56:11.848 --> 00:56:13.766
Did you carve it yourself?

00:56:14.893 --> 00:56:17.061
You're so crafty.

00:56:17.562 --> 00:56:19.814
Or should I say you're devoted?

00:56:19.898 --> 00:56:20.857
Keep it down.

00:56:21.941 --> 00:56:23.693
Is this for Sun-jeong? A propose ring?

00:56:24.903 --> 00:56:26.988
No, it's just her birthday present.

00:56:27.071 --> 00:56:28.489
Is that so?

00:56:29.240 --> 00:56:32.076
Since her birthday is in half a year…

00:56:33.077 --> 00:56:34.662
It must be her birthday present.

00:56:35.413 --> 00:56:36.706
What is it?

00:56:39.709 --> 00:56:41.169
What are you hiding?

00:56:42.712 --> 00:56:44.756
If it's a snack, give me a bite.

00:56:44.839 --> 00:56:45.798
It's nothing.

00:56:45.882 --> 00:56:48.301
What is it? Give me some too.

00:56:48.384 --> 00:56:50.428
It's not a snack. It's not food.

00:56:52.931 --> 00:56:54.432
You're acting suspicious.

00:56:54.515 --> 00:56:56.601
Even if it's not a snack,
I want to see it.

00:56:56.684 --> 00:56:59.687
I said it was nothing. Just let it go.

00:57:00.772 --> 00:57:02.398
You're acting weird, Min-cheol.

00:57:05.235 --> 00:57:07.820
I'll count to three.
Fess up before I'm done counting.

00:57:09.155 --> 00:57:10.323
One.

00:57:11.866 --> 00:57:13.117
Two.

00:57:14.577 --> 00:57:16.371
You should just give it to her.

00:57:16.454 --> 00:57:17.747
Two and a half.

00:57:17.830 --> 00:57:19.165
Give it to her.

00:57:19.249 --> 00:57:20.708
I'll really count three.

00:57:20.792 --> 00:57:22.502
It's over if I do.

00:57:22.585 --> 00:57:24.420
Two and a quarter.

00:57:24.504 --> 00:57:26.631
I'll really count to three!

00:57:26.714 --> 00:57:29.759
Gosh, just give it to her now!
You're so frustrating.

00:57:39.394 --> 00:57:41.020
Hey, your knee!

00:57:41.604 --> 00:57:42.814
Knee!

00:57:43.481 --> 00:57:45.066
Get on your knee and do it properly.

00:57:46.484 --> 00:57:47.318
Okay.

00:57:53.283 --> 00:57:55.243
Is she punishing you? Is this a school?

00:57:57.704 --> 00:57:58.788
Get on one knee.

00:58:49.756 --> 00:58:50.757
I'm sorry.

00:58:52.675 --> 00:58:54.177
I'll buy you a real ring next time.

00:58:55.887 --> 00:58:56.971
No.

00:59:00.975 --> 00:59:02.393
I like this.

00:59:06.606 --> 00:59:09.192
It's the one and only ring in the world.

01:00:15.550 --> 01:00:16.926
Did you get the diary?

01:00:17.009 --> 01:00:20.054
Yes. But have a look at this first.

01:00:20.138 --> 01:00:23.474
About the case you asked me
to look into as a buy-one-get-one-free.

01:00:23.558 --> 01:00:25.017
Look at this.

01:00:25.101 --> 01:00:27.103
I was checking the dashcams of

01:00:27.186 --> 01:00:29.439
the courier trucks
that passed by the place

01:00:29.522 --> 01:00:31.733
around 5:00 p.m.
when the accident happened.

01:00:31.816 --> 01:00:35.069
But they're very busy with their work,

01:00:35.153 --> 01:00:37.780
so it's been taking so much time
to reach them.

01:00:37.864 --> 01:00:40.992
Many have deleted the dashcam footage
of February 26 as well.

01:00:42.201 --> 01:00:45.913
But after Hwa-jin went live on the news,

01:00:45.997 --> 01:00:48.207
I'm getting tons of tip-offs.

01:00:48.291 --> 01:00:50.543
Not just the delivery men,

01:00:50.626 --> 01:00:52.962
but people who passed by that place

01:00:53.045 --> 01:00:54.964
when the hit-and-run happened

01:00:55.047 --> 01:00:56.883
are uploading their accounts.

01:00:56.966 --> 01:00:58.092
This is one of them.

01:01:17.487 --> 01:01:18.905
Here.

01:01:20.823 --> 01:01:23.159
It didn't capture
the car plate number, though.

01:01:25.244 --> 01:01:27.538
The police might take some time.

01:01:28.039 --> 01:01:29.081
But,

01:01:30.583 --> 01:01:33.920
they will find out in the end.

01:03:12.727 --> 01:03:15.271
Ms. Cha is being investigated
for the hit-and-run.

01:03:15.354 --> 01:03:17.231
You know Eom Sun-jeong, don't you?

01:03:17.315 --> 01:03:19.275
Witness or not, it doesn't matter.

01:03:19.358 --> 01:03:21.819
The fact is that I'm her husband.

01:03:21.903 --> 01:03:23.779
I'm the one who hit her!

01:03:23.863 --> 01:03:26.699
It was Ms. Sung who drove that day, right?

01:03:26.782 --> 01:03:28.200
Eom Min-jeong.

01:03:28.284 --> 01:03:32.371
Should I reveal why you abandoned
your name as Eom Min-jeong

01:03:32.455 --> 01:03:34.165
and lived as Lee Hwa-jin?

01:03:36.375 --> 01:03:39.545
There's something I need you to do,
Lawyer Kang.

01:03:40.630 --> 01:03:42.632
