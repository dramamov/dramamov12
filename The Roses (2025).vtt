00:55.750 --> 00:59.875
Okay. So, today's session,
the ten things you love about each other.

01:00.625 --> 01:01.792
Theo, you first.

01:03.167 --> 01:04.125
Sure.

01:04.542 --> 01:07.375
One. I would rather
live with her than a wolf.

01:10.125 --> 01:11.458
Did you say wolf?

01:12.208 --> 01:13.500
-Yeah.
-Wow.

01:14.167 --> 01:16.375
-Well...
-One. He has arms.

01:19.000 --> 01:21.542
Well, I saw a documentary once
about a man without arms

01:21.625 --> 01:24.292
and it looked like a difficult life,
particularly for the partner, so...

01:25.208 --> 01:26.375
I like that he has arms.

01:26.458 --> 01:27.750
Yeah. That's fair.

01:30.375 --> 01:31.208
Arms.

01:31.750 --> 01:35.125
Two, the shape of her head
is somewhat pleasing.

01:35.208 --> 01:36.458
At a distance.

01:37.000 --> 01:39.417
Three, I have memories of her being witty.

01:40.167 --> 01:42.833
Four, she smells pleasant. On occasion.

01:42.917 --> 01:44.792
I actually struggled to write any more.

01:45.417 --> 01:48.292
Two. His breath smells like an anchovy
that's been on the piss all night.

01:48.708 --> 01:52.000
Three, the way he laughs
is like a diseased dog's death rattle.

01:52.083 --> 01:54.000
Four, he's a bad father.

01:54.083 --> 01:56.042
A fucked lover. A complete deadshit.

01:56.125 --> 01:58.125
A victim. A loser. A wanker.

01:58.208 --> 02:00.458
Number ten. "Theo, what a cunt."

02:04.375 --> 02:05.833
That wasn't the task.

02:05.917 --> 02:09.125
Those are things you hate. It's not funny.

02:09.208 --> 02:11.458
That is... That's actually quite funny.

02:11.542 --> 02:14.750
I see so much resentment
and defensiveness.

02:14.833 --> 02:16.917
An inability to apologize.

02:17.000 --> 02:18.833
To share your vulnerability.

02:19.250 --> 02:22.125
In his defense, he is a whiny baby,
so that's vulnerability.

02:22.750 --> 02:23.667
Verbal cruelty.

02:23.958 --> 02:25.833
In England we call that repartee.

02:25.917 --> 02:29.667
Self-righteousness. Mockery.
An inability to admit wrongs.

02:29.750 --> 02:33.125
I don't think you have the capacity
to fix your problems.

02:36.917 --> 02:39.500
It's terrifying how close we came
to losing each other.

02:40.625 --> 02:42.167
Lucky us.

02:42.250 --> 02:43.625
Lucky us.

02:44.125 --> 02:45.375
Always have been.

02:46.083 --> 02:47.250
Remember when we met?

02:48.000 --> 02:48.917
Good day.

02:51.833 --> 02:54.917
So, I think this is a moment
of celebration for all of us.

02:56.208 --> 02:58.500
I think we can be very proud
of this building.

02:58.583 --> 03:00.042
-Congratulations, Darren.
-Congratulations, Darren.

03:00.125 --> 03:00.958
Cheers, everyone.

03:01.042 --> 03:02.708
Dear God. He actually means it.

03:03.292 --> 03:04.208
Theo, what did you say?

03:06.125 --> 03:10.625
Sorry. I was just remembering how we
got rid of the cascading garden balconies

03:10.708 --> 03:12.792
so that we are denying the humans

03:12.875 --> 03:15.375
who will be living
in these 700 featureless boxes

03:15.458 --> 03:17.833
the chance to engage with fresh air,
see a horizon,

03:17.917 --> 03:19.708
or maybe decisively embrace the moment

03:19.792 --> 03:21.750
that living in their apartments
makes them want to jump.

03:21.833 --> 03:24.125
So, really, people,
when you think about it,

03:24.208 --> 03:25.625
we saved lives.

03:25.958 --> 03:26.833
To us!

03:26.917 --> 03:30.083
Right. I mean, the balcony thing
is actually a good example, Theo.

03:30.167 --> 03:32.417
I detect a note of bitterness about it,

03:32.500 --> 03:35.875
but we all have to grind ourselves
and our whims as architects

03:35.958 --> 03:37.625
down to the market's needs...

03:42.000 --> 03:42.875
Sorry.

03:45.125 --> 03:46.542
I just need a moment
so I don't kill myself

03:46.625 --> 03:47.792
in front of my colleagues.

03:48.083 --> 03:49.542
Interesting. How would you do it?

03:50.792 --> 03:53.417
Do you have a very large knife anywhere?

03:53.500 --> 03:54.667
I do.

03:55.208 --> 03:56.792
I need it to finish this though.

03:58.000 --> 03:59.167
I'll happily wait.

04:05.458 --> 04:06.292
What is this?

04:06.667 --> 04:08.125
Trout carpaccio.

04:10.042 --> 04:11.667
Oh, wait. Try it with some of this.

04:23.167 --> 04:24.208
Jesus!

04:24.542 --> 04:26.583
Well, don't give Him credit. It's all me.

04:26.667 --> 04:28.125
Dehydrated blackberry and anchovy.

04:28.208 --> 04:30.250
I want to put it on there
but the chef won't let me.

04:30.708 --> 04:31.958
How can we live like this?

04:32.042 --> 04:36.333
Me, no cascading garden balconies.
You, no dehydrated thingy.

04:37.792 --> 04:39.500
Personally, I'm moving
to America next week

04:39.583 --> 04:41.417
to live free and become a chef.

04:42.292 --> 04:43.542
Well, maybe I should join you.

04:45.333 --> 04:46.917
We haven't even had sex yet.

04:49.375 --> 04:51.042
That's minutes away though.

04:53.875 --> 04:54.875
Very true.

05:05.875 --> 05:07.292
Service!

05:07.625 --> 05:09.333
Join me in the cool room.

05:09.917 --> 05:10.750
Theo.

05:11.208 --> 05:12.042
Ivy.

07:16.625 --> 07:18.083
Who wants to eat the bus driver?

07:18.167 --> 07:19.083
Me!

07:19.833 --> 07:21.208
So weird, the tall buses.

07:21.292 --> 07:22.250
And why are they red?

07:22.333 --> 07:24.000
So you can see them 'cause it's so foggy.

07:24.083 --> 07:25.833
Well it's not so foggy there anymore.

07:25.917 --> 07:27.167
Not since Jack the Ripper died.

07:28.208 --> 07:31.125
Look. Try Tower Bridge.
So this is liquorice.

07:31.208 --> 07:34.083
Add this dark chocolate,
this raspberry, and this--

07:34.167 --> 07:36.125
don't tell anyone-- shrimp powder.

07:36.417 --> 07:37.250
A fish?

07:37.708 --> 07:39.958
Depth of flavor without the fishiness.
Close your eyes.

07:42.125 --> 07:43.958
-Gosh!
-Gosh indeed!

07:44.042 --> 07:45.458
Look, I know it's a museum.

07:45.542 --> 07:48.125
But it's supposed to represent
a sail on a ship,

07:48.208 --> 07:49.625
so it should feel like that.

07:49.708 --> 07:52.708
You should expect pirates
to come round the corner at any moment.

07:54.125 --> 07:56.000
No. I'm joking.

07:56.083 --> 07:57.208
Look, I want the sail.

07:57.292 --> 08:00.417
The question you have to ask yourself
is how do you want to live your life?

08:00.500 --> 08:02.292
-With courage or without?
-Dad!

08:02.375 --> 08:04.333
Thank you, then I'll send you the numbers.

08:05.500 --> 08:06.333
Daddy!

08:06.750 --> 08:08.417
We're eating British icons.

08:08.500 --> 08:10.292
Caramel miso Buckingham Palace.

08:10.625 --> 08:11.458
Yes. Of course you are.

08:11.542 --> 08:13.875
Look. Big Ben shiso bourbon cookie.

08:13.958 --> 08:15.000
Sounds good.

08:16.167 --> 08:18.417
I feel dizzy and my tongue's fizzing.

08:18.792 --> 08:19.625
Yeah.

08:19.708 --> 08:21.708
Amazing. Of course.

08:21.792 --> 08:23.083
But, don't you think it might be
a bit of a problem

08:23.167 --> 08:24.958
turning their blood 40-proof sucrose?

08:25.375 --> 08:26.500
Don't sugar shame them.

08:26.583 --> 08:28.000
But it is bad for their health long-term.

08:28.083 --> 08:28.917
And they will get fat.

08:29.000 --> 08:30.042
Buddha was fat.

08:30.125 --> 08:31.000
And he was great.

08:31.083 --> 08:32.042
-He was great.
-Ivy.

08:32.125 --> 08:33.542
Look, they'll learn to self manage.

08:33.625 --> 08:36.042
If you restrict things,
it leads to weird obsessions.

08:36.125 --> 08:37.582
-I feel sick.
-See?

08:37.917 --> 08:40.082
I do. I see a girl learning her limits.

08:41.667 --> 08:44.333
Lesson learned. Limit reached.
Parenting tip from Mummy.

08:45.458 --> 08:47.833
Oh, dear. Oh, you're fine.

08:48.125 --> 08:50.000
Can't you just admit you're wrong?

08:50.083 --> 08:51.792
On the day that I am, I can.

08:51.875 --> 08:54.000
But not on the day I built your building,

08:54.083 --> 08:56.792
soon to be the eighth wonder of the world,
here in Northern California,

08:56.875 --> 08:59.125
in raspberry shortcake!

08:59.208 --> 09:01.208
Oh, my God.

09:01.292 --> 09:02.417
How did you do that, Mom?

09:02.500 --> 09:04.125
You know the way to my ego.

09:04.208 --> 09:06.042
My God. Isn't your mummy brilliant?

09:06.125 --> 09:07.667
'Course she is.
That's a rhetorical question.

09:07.750 --> 09:09.708
-You are a genius.
-Yeah. Agreed.

09:09.792 --> 09:10.917
I feel good to go again.

09:11.000 --> 09:11.958
Stomach of Caligula.

09:12.042 --> 09:14.125
You know the way
to make your daddy proud.

09:14.208 --> 09:15.250
-Are we ready?
-Yes.

09:15.333 --> 09:16.542
Wait for it.

09:20.042 --> 09:21.125
-Oh, my God.
-This is so good.

09:21.208 --> 09:22.083
Okay. I've gotta have some.

09:22.167 --> 09:23.750
Raspberries.
Wait, wait, wait. Raspberries.

09:23.833 --> 09:26.250
-Going in!
-Mom, you're allergic.

09:26.333 --> 09:27.167
Ready?

09:28.042 --> 09:28.875
Oh, no.

09:30.417 --> 09:32.208
I am a genius.

09:33.750 --> 09:35.708
That... is...

09:42.625 --> 09:43.458
Divine.

09:43.792 --> 09:44.750
Maniac.

09:49.000 --> 09:50.792
-We're going to the beach!
-All right.

09:50.875 --> 09:52.625
-Race you!
-Don't drown.

09:53.833 --> 09:54.917
So what are we doing here?

09:55.000 --> 09:57.917
Remember when we had the kids
and the patriarchy sent that note

09:58.000 --> 10:01.833
saying, "Squash your dreams
and facilitate children and husband"?

10:01.917 --> 10:03.333
Oh, yes. That note. I remember that note.

10:03.417 --> 10:05.083
Bit terse. Quite soul destroying.

10:05.167 --> 10:06.292
Agreed.

10:06.375 --> 10:07.917
Well, look at this place.

10:08.000 --> 10:10.208
It's been closed for a year.
Maybe a little bit out of the way.

10:10.292 --> 10:13.292
But I think it's cool,
and I've got that money from the design.

10:13.375 --> 10:15.417
For the down payment on our dream house.

10:15.500 --> 10:16.333
No.

10:17.292 --> 10:22.250
My darling, most days you're making
seven iconic desserts for three people.

10:22.625 --> 10:26.000
Look, the amazing chef that you are
and have always wanted to be

10:26.083 --> 10:29.125
should not be a dream that dies
on the crucifix of family life.

10:29.625 --> 10:30.708
What are you looking at?

10:31.500 --> 10:32.833
I love all that though.

10:36.708 --> 10:39.667
I mean, maybe
for a couple of nights a week.

10:40.042 --> 10:41.333
My God. Thank you.

10:41.417 --> 10:42.583
I think that's a yes.

10:43.500 --> 10:45.625
-Oh, and I know what we're gonna call it.
-You do?

10:58.833 --> 10:59.667
Wow. Hello.

10:59.750 --> 11:01.458
-Handsome fellas.
-All right.

11:11.250 --> 11:13.083
-Nice!
-Thank you!

11:19.542 --> 11:21.750
Sir. We don't accept coupons.

11:22.042 --> 11:23.000
Yeah, we do.

11:27.500 --> 11:29.333
It's for Bed Bath & Beyond.

11:30.167 --> 11:31.083
We do.

11:31.167 --> 11:34.292
Oh, Jeff. We're closing Wednesday night
for Hattie's soccer match.

11:34.375 --> 11:35.833
Right. Of course we are.

11:36.542 --> 11:38.875
Bye, Jeffrey! Remember that you love me.

11:41.542 --> 11:42.375
Busy lunch?

11:42.458 --> 11:44.042
Untroubled by humanity.

11:44.542 --> 11:45.625
Maybe it's the name.

11:45.708 --> 11:47.625
How about "We've Got Chlamydia"?

11:47.708 --> 11:48.708
It's catchy.

11:50.208 --> 11:53.000
So, where are we meeting
our wonderful American friends?

11:59.708 --> 12:01.875
-Barry!
-There they are.

12:01.958 --> 12:03.583
What's up, buddy? I was worried.

12:03.667 --> 12:05.042
-You guys are late.
-Sorry.

12:05.125 --> 12:06.958
That's how you lost the Revolutionary War,
am I right?

12:08.625 --> 12:10.167
Finally we got you here.

12:10.250 --> 12:11.625
-Sure.
-Check this out.

12:12.500 --> 12:14.458
Let's do this, motherfucker.

12:14.542 --> 12:16.417
I'm actually not supposed to do that.

12:16.500 --> 12:17.375
Come on.

12:18.208 --> 12:20.000
Okay. This is something
I will never get used to here.

12:20.083 --> 12:21.792
It's fine. It'll be fun.

12:21.875 --> 12:23.333
Oh, fuck!

12:23.417 --> 12:24.375
Get you all checked in.

12:25.292 --> 12:26.917
The eagles have landed.

12:27.000 --> 12:28.333
-Hi.
-Oh, hey.

12:28.417 --> 12:30.167
-Hi!
-Hi, Sally.

12:31.292 --> 12:32.250
They've all got their own guns.

12:32.333 --> 12:35.083
That they have. Fuck, yeah, they have.

12:35.167 --> 12:37.167
Hi, guys. How are you?

12:37.250 --> 12:38.833
I... I need you to know.

12:38.917 --> 12:40.583
I am anti-gun.

12:40.667 --> 12:42.250
I am here ironically.

12:42.583 --> 12:45.667
I am doing this as a statement
against guns.

12:46.292 --> 12:47.667
Do you want a Glock?

12:48.042 --> 12:50.708
My father actually killed an intruder
with this one.

12:50.792 --> 12:53.542
Or I have a beautiful Smith & Wesson
you could borrow.

12:53.875 --> 12:57.292
Yes. I think I'll take this black beauty
that's already killed someone.

12:57.375 --> 12:59.042
Actually, I got you something.

12:59.125 --> 13:01.333
You've been here ten years. It was time.

13:03.333 --> 13:05.292
I'm... Wow.

13:05.375 --> 13:08.042
-Wow. Barry.
-Yeah.

13:08.125 --> 13:09.417
That is really sweet.

13:09.500 --> 13:10.750
You didn't tell me you were gonna do that.

13:10.833 --> 13:13.250
-Yeah, I did. A couple times.
-Stop mumbling, babe.

13:13.333 --> 13:15.708
Anyways, we all loathe guns.

13:15.792 --> 13:16.958
Everybody's got 'em
so what are you gonna do?

13:17.042 --> 13:18.375
Gotta defend yourself.

13:18.458 --> 13:20.625
Right. Careful. It's got a hair trigger.

13:28.583 --> 13:34.125
Okay, a perfect takedown
is groin, elbow, right eye, in that order.

13:36.958 --> 13:38.125
-Sit into it.
-Yup.

13:42.333 --> 13:45.125
Look at that! Five shots.
All to the larynx.

13:45.417 --> 13:46.458
It makes him so happy.

13:46.542 --> 13:49.208
Yeah. That wasn't the game.
I said groin first.

13:49.292 --> 13:51.292
Oh, yeah. But I changed it to larynx
and then won.

13:51.375 --> 13:53.333
Come on Theo and Ivy!

13:54.333 --> 13:55.375
-'Kay.
-Yeah.

13:55.458 --> 13:56.750
This is my distance.

13:56.833 --> 13:58.917
Yes, quickly! He's getting away!

14:00.542 --> 14:03.500
I mean, I really cannot wait
to see this building, Theo.

14:03.583 --> 14:04.833
Sally. Thank you.

14:04.917 --> 14:06.083
It's the talk of the town.

14:06.167 --> 14:09.917
Can Theo Rose encapsulate
our maritime history

14:10.000 --> 14:11.750
in steel, concrete, and wood?

14:11.833 --> 14:13.750
You know what? I just might.

14:14.250 --> 14:16.000
You know that island is a historic site?

14:16.083 --> 14:17.000
It's been mentioned.

14:17.292 --> 14:19.042
Don't fuck it up. Has that been mentioned?

14:19.833 --> 14:22.250
Actually, yeah, a man
did shout that at us in the street.

14:22.333 --> 14:23.250
Yes.

14:23.333 --> 14:25.833
I thought it looked crazy beautiful
in the designs.

14:26.917 --> 14:27.750
Thank you, Amy.

14:27.833 --> 14:30.458
What? I thought it looked
a little half-assed and simplistic

14:30.542 --> 14:35.542
in its attempt to render
California's history in some fun form.

14:36.083 --> 14:36.917
No offense.

14:37.000 --> 14:38.917
-Is anyone else getting that?
-Rory.

14:39.000 --> 14:43.458
None taken, due to the fact
that you are so very, very wrong.

14:43.542 --> 14:46.083
I feel that buildings should be fun

14:46.167 --> 14:50.375
and feel temporary and chaotic
and alive and beautiful.

14:50.458 --> 14:55.333
And remind us of all that humans can
and should be at our very best.

14:55.417 --> 14:56.708
Oh, my God.

14:56.792 --> 14:59.125
Disagree with all of that.
But... good luck.

14:59.208 --> 15:00.667
I'm excited for you, Theodore.

15:00.750 --> 15:02.417
Jesus. Rory, what's up with you?

15:02.500 --> 15:03.625
-It's okay.
-He's our guest in my home.

15:03.708 --> 15:04.958
-What's the deal?
-I thought I could be honest.

15:05.042 --> 15:06.167
Architect to architect.

15:06.250 --> 15:08.042
The guy's a star!

15:08.125 --> 15:09.500
Sorry. I kinda do this.

15:09.583 --> 15:11.208
Yeah. We are excited for you, Theo.

15:11.292 --> 15:15.417
When we worked together, I was like,
"This guy is gonna do something special."

15:15.500 --> 15:16.792
How? How did you know?

15:16.875 --> 15:18.000
Maybe after this you will.

15:18.083 --> 15:19.708
To Theo. Hear, hear.

15:19.792 --> 15:21.042
Yes. To Theo.

15:21.125 --> 15:22.667
Thank you. Thank you.

15:23.458 --> 15:25.000
This is weird.

15:27.208 --> 15:28.792
I should-- I should get this.

15:29.958 --> 15:31.833
-What?
-Let's get out of here.

15:33.167 --> 15:34.042
Okay.

15:34.708 --> 15:36.125
Oh, God.

15:37.042 --> 15:39.667
Jiminy Cricket.
That's pretty... pretty serious.

15:39.750 --> 15:41.333
No, we will. Yeah.

15:41.417 --> 15:42.750
We-- we've got to go.

15:42.833 --> 15:43.667
-Everything okay?
-What?

15:43.750 --> 15:46.583
Well... a few years ago in England...

15:46.667 --> 15:49.958
we helped an escaped convict
who was hiding out on the moors.

15:50.042 --> 15:53.792
We gave him food, read him sonnets,
and then he was gone. Poof.

15:53.875 --> 15:55.958
But, apparently,
he's turned up at our home here,

15:56.042 --> 16:00.000
and he has a rucksack full of coke
and a sword.

16:01.708 --> 16:04.000
So... we'll call you.

16:04.292 --> 16:06.167
Well, let us know
if you need help with the coke.

16:07.417 --> 16:10.125
Really? A rucksack
full of coke and a sword?

16:13.500 --> 16:15.125
Thank you for lying so badly for me.

16:15.208 --> 16:17.333
For you, dear, anything.

16:17.625 --> 16:19.125
I do believe that's true.

16:19.958 --> 16:21.208
It really is.

16:24.167 --> 16:28.208
In the East Bay Maritime Museum,
architect Theo Rose

16:28.292 --> 16:30.542
has created a new form,

16:30.625 --> 16:34.208
a groundbreaking design
that celebrates those sailors

16:34.292 --> 16:36.625
who quested into the unknown.

16:36.708 --> 16:40.333
And as they sailed from California
into the open sea

16:40.417 --> 16:44.083
with courage and curiosity
about what was possible...

16:44.792 --> 16:49.333
Well, I felt that the building
had to do the same.

16:51.208 --> 16:52.500
There he is.

16:52.583 --> 16:53.792
Theo!

16:54.208 --> 16:55.583
Amazing building, buddy.

16:56.625 --> 16:59.000
You are about to leave
an indelible mark on the earth.

16:59.417 --> 17:00.708
Oh, man. Thank you.

17:00.792 --> 17:02.542
Yeah. Not everyone does, you know.

17:03.083 --> 17:06.541
Most people just push paper
and small talk, have dull sex.

17:07.250 --> 17:08.708
Leave nary a dent.

17:10.208 --> 17:12.666
Makes you wonder. What's the point?

17:14.750 --> 17:15.583
Are you okay?

17:16.583 --> 17:18.000
Oh, yeah. I'm great. Great.

17:18.083 --> 17:21.000
-I heard that on a podcast or something.
-Okay.

17:21.083 --> 17:23.500
I was like, "Thank God that's not me!"

17:45.375 --> 17:48.625
Breaking news: A historic storm
hits Northern California.

17:48.708 --> 17:50.500
Major freeways are shut down

17:50.583 --> 17:53.083
due to high winds and torrential rains
across the region.

17:56.208 --> 17:57.375
Oh, shit.

17:57.458 --> 17:58.333
Just a sec.

17:59.833 --> 18:03.333
They closed the freeway, so they are
funneling traffic down this road.

18:03.417 --> 18:05.250
I mean, actual customers.

18:05.333 --> 18:06.667
Shit.

18:10.167 --> 18:11.250
That's her.

18:11.333 --> 18:13.958
Pardon my French,
but the way that the wind catches the sail

18:14.042 --> 18:15.542
is whimsical as fuck.

18:16.792 --> 18:17.750
Yeah.

18:18.542 --> 18:19.583
It's Ivy.

18:20.583 --> 18:22.583
-Hello.
-People are here.

18:22.667 --> 18:25.958
The San Francisco Chronicle
food critic is here.

18:26.042 --> 18:27.208
That's amazing.

18:27.292 --> 18:29.125
No. Neither is amazing.

18:29.208 --> 18:30.875
People here is bad.

18:30.958 --> 18:32.875
Her being here is badder.

18:33.333 --> 18:34.708
Are you stoned?

18:35.500 --> 18:36.833
Yeah.

18:37.833 --> 18:39.167
Is that bending?

18:39.417 --> 18:40.792
Look. You can do this.

18:40.875 --> 18:42.833
No, I disagree. I think I might...

18:43.292 --> 18:46.375
I might set a fire in the kitchen
and let it break into the dining room,

18:46.458 --> 18:47.417
and then they'll all leave.

18:47.500 --> 18:49.125
It's okay. I've got this. I've got this.

18:49.208 --> 18:52.792
My darling, no review can hurt a business
that only does thirty covers a week.

18:52.875 --> 18:54.083
That's actually a good point.

18:54.167 --> 18:55.875
Just cook like you do for me.

18:57.083 --> 18:58.583
Like I'm trying to make her fuck me.

18:58.875 --> 18:59.708
Yeah!

19:00.583 --> 19:01.750
Yeah, okay.

19:02.583 --> 19:04.250
I love you.

19:04.333 --> 19:07.167
Never leave me, but when you do,
will you kill me on the way out?

19:07.250 --> 19:08.083
Will do.

19:08.167 --> 19:09.542
Okay, thank you. Bye.

19:20.667 --> 19:21.500
No.

19:23.292 --> 19:24.417
Oh, my God!

19:25.917 --> 19:27.542
That shit is coming down.

19:27.625 --> 19:29.333
It's gonna be all right.
It's gonna be okay.

19:29.417 --> 19:31.917
It's a sail. It was built to move.

19:32.000 --> 19:33.833
-It's not gonna fall.
-I think it might.

19:34.125 --> 19:37.083
It's not gonna fall.
No, no. Stop filming, guys!

19:39.083 --> 19:40.042
Cute place.

19:41.500 --> 19:43.083
Eat that first and then that.

19:43.167 --> 19:46.500
Squeeze that on that.
And that's salt I made.

19:46.792 --> 19:49.458
I came when I first tried it.
No promises for you.

19:49.542 --> 19:52.667
Sexuality's vast and idiosyncratic but...

19:55.125 --> 19:58.167
Eat and go. Okay, bye.

19:58.250 --> 19:59.917
It's gonna be okay. It's not gonna fall.

20:00.000 --> 20:02.083
-Stop! Stop!
-Don't film my friend!

20:02.167 --> 20:04.458
Don't film! Seriously. Don't film!

20:04.542 --> 20:06.083
Come on! Quit it!

20:15.833 --> 20:16.875
Oh, my God!

20:16.958 --> 20:19.167
Oh, no!

20:49.375 --> 20:50.250
Theo!

20:52.292 --> 20:53.125
Theo!

20:53.208 --> 20:54.875
-All right, come on! Don't film!
-It's not gonna fall.

20:54.958 --> 20:56.125
All right? Stop!

20:56.208 --> 20:57.292
It's not gonna fall.

20:57.375 --> 20:59.458
Jesus Christ! Somebody! Please!

20:59.542 --> 21:00.583
Stop.

21:00.667 --> 21:02.333
Come on, guys. It's not funny.

21:05.208 --> 21:06.042
Hi!

21:06.125 --> 21:07.958
Fuck! No, no, no!

21:08.042 --> 21:10.750
Are you still watching that?
You've been up all night.

21:10.833 --> 21:12.833
-Help me! Don't fucking film me!
-Possibly.

21:12.917 --> 21:13.917
That shit is coming down.

21:14.000 --> 21:15.125
You need to stop watching that.

21:15.208 --> 21:17.875
I don't understand it.
It should have held.

21:18.542 --> 21:20.000
It was just a freak storm.

21:20.083 --> 21:23.417
Cheap fucking steel, I bet, or...
something?

21:23.500 --> 21:27.125
I mean, I wanted it to have movement,
just not fucking set sail.

21:28.292 --> 21:30.125
I know. Are you sure you're all right?

21:31.708 --> 21:33.333
Yeah. Yeah. I'll be fine.

21:33.417 --> 21:37.417
You know, water off a duck's back.
Just a bump in the road.

21:38.292 --> 21:40.750
Sorry. You wanted to tell me something.
I heard you yelling.

21:41.542 --> 21:42.750
Nothing. Can't recall.

21:43.583 --> 21:44.958
Your review. How is it?

21:45.625 --> 21:47.042
It's not really worth reading.

21:47.125 --> 21:48.500
Not while you're going through this.

21:48.583 --> 21:49.542
Ivy.

21:56.083 --> 21:58.417
-This is amazing.
-It's just a dumb review.

21:58.500 --> 22:00.500
It's the same thing as your thing,
my darling.

22:00.583 --> 22:02.125
It's gonna be forgotten tomorrow.

22:02.208 --> 22:04.333
Today's news, tomorrow's fish and chips.

22:09.667 --> 22:12.125
Is he all right? I mean, what's he say?

22:12.208 --> 22:15.042
He doesn't really,
and it seems rude to ask.

22:15.125 --> 22:16.292
You're his wife.

22:16.375 --> 22:18.083
And you don't usually mind being rude.

22:18.375 --> 22:20.083
He's crushed and embarrassed,

22:20.167 --> 22:22.917
and I don't wanna make it worse
by making him talk about it.

22:40.500 --> 22:42.583
You said we could go have lunch
at the shack.

22:42.667 --> 22:43.542
Come on, Dad.

22:46.708 --> 22:49.125
Okay. I'll go get dressed.

22:50.542 --> 22:51.542
My God.

22:52.833 --> 22:54.917
You need to come out here.

22:59.750 --> 23:01.000
Oh, my gosh! Hi!

23:01.750 --> 23:02.833
What do they want?

23:02.917 --> 23:03.833
Food.

23:05.083 --> 23:06.208
Your food.

23:28.542 --> 23:30.958
You know what we should do?
We should have a little sing along.

23:31.042 --> 23:31.917
Sure.

23:32.000 --> 23:34.500
Let's sing... "Bananas"?

23:34.583 --> 23:36.125
-Yeah.
-Definitely.

23:44.042 --> 23:45.625
Oh, I know. How about opera?

23:49.375 --> 23:50.958
-No. I'm so sorry.
-Is that one nine?

23:51.042 --> 23:52.083
The website crashed.

23:52.167 --> 23:53.958
-Reservation for when?
-We're booked out for two months.

23:54.042 --> 23:55.125
No, I am so sorry.

23:55.208 --> 23:57.333
We could open
for more than three days a week.

23:58.167 --> 23:59.375
Right. Okay. Wow.

23:59.458 --> 24:02.000
I am just seeing tips everywhere,
like I am a stripper

24:02.083 --> 24:03.458
and a convention is in town.

24:04.250 --> 24:05.833
Service, Jeffrey.

24:05.917 --> 24:07.000
Coming!

24:12.500 --> 24:14.250
Hello

24:14.333 --> 24:15.250
Hello, Theo.

24:15.333 --> 24:16.417
Hi, Dave.

24:16.500 --> 24:18.792
Hi... boss. How you doing?

24:18.875 --> 24:21.667
Thank God no one was hurt. Are you okay?

24:22.125 --> 24:24.875
No, I'm okay. I'm... I'll bounce back.

24:25.250 --> 24:26.708
Not with us, you won't.

24:26.792 --> 24:30.458
I told you that dumb-ass sail
on top of the building was dangerous.

24:30.542 --> 24:32.500
The engineers are blaming you.

24:32.583 --> 24:34.375
Someone's gotta go down for this.

24:34.458 --> 24:36.125
Look, personally, I feel for you.

24:36.542 --> 24:39.125
I mean, some people would be suicidal.

24:39.208 --> 24:40.125
Are you, Dad?

24:40.208 --> 24:41.417
What? No!

24:41.500 --> 24:42.667
What's suicidal?

24:42.750 --> 24:43.958
He's gonna kill himself.

24:44.042 --> 24:44.958
Because of the building?

24:45.042 --> 24:46.667
Oh, shit. Are you with your kids?

24:50.000 --> 24:52.333
Look... don't listen
to what he said, okay?

24:52.417 --> 24:54.083
All right? I'm fine.

24:54.167 --> 24:56.667
It is just a building.

24:56.750 --> 24:58.208
I don't even care.

24:58.292 --> 25:00.792
Is that why it fell down?
Because you didn't care?

25:00.875 --> 25:03.542
No, I fucking gave my lifeblood to it.
It was everything to me.

25:19.083 --> 25:19.958
Fuck.

25:24.125 --> 25:27.417
Jesus. That fucking sail!

25:28.750 --> 25:30.000
Is he killing himself?

25:31.667 --> 25:32.792
I can't see.

25:39.458 --> 25:40.292
Kids.

25:42.750 --> 25:44.500
-Hi, Mom!
-Hey!

25:44.875 --> 25:46.417
Wow! Look at this place!

25:47.125 --> 25:48.750
Why are you dirty
and missing clumps of hair?

25:48.833 --> 25:49.958
Am I? That's strange.

25:50.042 --> 25:52.250
I had the car window open. Strong wind.

25:52.333 --> 25:53.667
Got fired actually.

25:53.750 --> 25:56.125
And he's suicidal.
Would that make us orphans?

25:56.208 --> 25:57.458
No, you'd still have me.

25:57.542 --> 25:58.833
-Fired?
-Shoo.

26:00.125 --> 26:03.125
Look, you're very busy. We'll sit down
and eat and I'll look for a new job.

26:03.208 --> 26:04.125
Are you all right?

26:04.667 --> 26:07.208
Yeah, yeah, yeah. I'm fine.
I mean, it's like my grandma said,

26:07.292 --> 26:09.208
"Life's cruel, nobody really
wants you for who you are,

26:09.292 --> 26:11.708
and then you die in pain seeking solace
that will never come."

26:11.792 --> 26:14.792
So... you know,
maybe my expectations were too high.

26:16.125 --> 26:17.125
Oh, God.

26:18.667 --> 26:22.000
Do you sell negronis, and is there a limit
on how many one can drink?

26:22.083 --> 26:24.208
Go sit down. Go sit down.

26:28.583 --> 26:29.792
-I'm winnin'.
-Nuh-uh.

26:29.875 --> 26:30.750
Yeah-huh.

26:31.333 --> 26:32.583
Told you.

26:38.125 --> 26:40.417
-Hi. Oh, guys.
-Bravo!

26:42.792 --> 26:43.625
Okay. Thanks.

26:44.125 --> 26:45.375
Thank you so much. Thanks for coming.

26:45.458 --> 26:46.292
Thank you.

26:46.583 --> 26:47.625
They love you.

26:48.250 --> 26:49.083
Awkward.

26:49.167 --> 26:50.875
No. I think it's great.

26:52.792 --> 26:53.625
Are you okay?

26:53.708 --> 26:55.542
-Are you really fired?
-Yeah.

26:55.625 --> 26:57.792
Oh, Theo. I'm so sorry.

26:58.667 --> 27:00.292
Yes, well...

27:00.375 --> 27:04.125
No point dwelling on that
when you are a huge hit.

27:04.208 --> 27:05.792
We should be dwelling on that.

27:07.042 --> 27:08.250
You needed a rest anyway.

27:08.333 --> 27:11.792
And I'm going to get one because
no one's going to hire me for a long time.

27:15.250 --> 27:18.125
Well, maybe I could open more often
'cause the phones are going crazy.

27:19.375 --> 27:21.708
I could do this
and pay the bills for a bit.

27:21.792 --> 27:25.042
Just a bit. And you could...
you could look after the kids.

27:26.750 --> 27:30.000
I could build children
instead of houses.

27:30.458 --> 27:32.292
I love how free they are.

27:33.125 --> 27:35.083
Yeah, well, enjoy it.
They're gonna get arrested soon.

27:37.667 --> 27:40.667
And we just do it for a little while.
It's not forever.

27:41.750 --> 27:43.875
Maybe I've been resisting my genius
for too long.

27:43.958 --> 27:45.583
-I've always said that.
-Yeah.

27:46.958 --> 27:48.875
No one can defeat us, Theo.

27:49.417 --> 27:50.958
I've always said that, too.

28:08.167 --> 28:09.250
Good luck.

28:17.583 --> 28:19.208
Waiter. Waiter.

28:21.000 --> 28:22.292
Chef.

28:26.125 --> 28:27.875
-Why don't you do it?
-I think you have to do it.

28:27.958 --> 28:29.875
-You're in charge.
-Yeah. They want to...

28:29.958 --> 28:31.042
They want to hear from you.

28:32.792 --> 28:35.208
Hi. I'm Ivy, and you're the staff.

28:35.542 --> 28:38.417
So, I'm not a very hierarchical person.

28:38.500 --> 28:39.708
So, you know.

28:41.833 --> 28:42.708
Be good.

28:44.167 --> 28:45.500
Okay. Dismissed. Brilliant.

28:46.833 --> 28:48.167
I thought it was inspiring.

28:48.250 --> 28:49.833
Like Obama was in the room.

28:50.875 --> 28:52.667
Yeah, look at that. Nice.

29:01.250 --> 29:02.167
Hello, children.

29:04.625 --> 29:05.500
Daddy's here.

29:08.292 --> 29:10.000
I am facilitating people,

29:10.083 --> 29:12.042
and that is a service,
and there is joy in service.

29:12.125 --> 29:15.000
There is not joy in the heavy rock
of expectation for myself.

29:15.333 --> 29:17.917
The endless need to be at the narcissistic
center of my own navel.

29:18.000 --> 29:19.333
The me, me, me dot com of it all.

29:19.417 --> 29:22.208
My building, my genius,
my career, my self worth.

29:22.292 --> 29:24.583
I mean, what is this thirst
for achievement and where has it got us?

29:24.667 --> 29:26.375
It's a blind giant dancing is what it is.

29:26.458 --> 29:28.458
'Cause a climate crisis,
a dying raped earth,

29:28.542 --> 29:30.958
inequality, tract housing,
endless fucking growth,

29:31.042 --> 29:32.458
and cupcake vending machines.

29:32.542 --> 29:34.708
You want to be a part of that,
you toxic fucking male,

29:34.792 --> 29:39.000
with your testosterone-filled
ambition-laced poison cum,

29:39.083 --> 29:40.583
jizzing in the face of humanity?

29:40.667 --> 29:42.333
No, no I do not.

29:42.417 --> 29:43.417
Is he okay?

29:43.500 --> 29:44.833
I think it helps him.

29:44.917 --> 29:48.167
I want to be part of the change.

29:50.333 --> 29:51.667
Come here, my darlings.

29:54.667 --> 29:57.167
We are gonna be just fine.

29:57.250 --> 29:59.708
No. More than fine.

30:00.583 --> 30:02.042
Wind sprints. Go!

30:06.250 --> 30:07.875
Left turn, my little worms!

30:10.375 --> 30:11.750
I need lemons.

30:11.833 --> 30:13.375
Can someone get me some lemons?

30:13.458 --> 30:15.792
-Do you have a reservation?
-And there are still dishes on the pass.

30:15.875 --> 30:18.167
And I am sweating into my eyeballs.

30:18.250 --> 30:19.292
Jane!

30:23.917 --> 30:24.750
Sorry.

30:24.833 --> 30:26.958
Obviously, I applaud your passion.

30:27.333 --> 30:29.250
You should know it could lead
to marriage and children.

30:29.583 --> 30:31.875
There's probably some hygiene
by-law about this.

30:32.208 --> 30:34.792
Just touch nothing else but each other.

30:34.875 --> 30:37.125
Okay. As you were.

30:37.208 --> 30:38.792
Carry on. Well done.

30:54.500 --> 30:56.125
Yass!

30:56.208 --> 30:59.375
Mama had a good lunch.

30:59.458 --> 31:01.458
134 covers.

31:01.542 --> 31:03.375
You are a big fucking success.

31:03.667 --> 31:05.000
-I really am.
-You are.

31:05.083 --> 31:06.500
I'm gonna need bigger shorts.

31:06.875 --> 31:08.167
More people, more money.

31:27.000 --> 31:28.333
-What a night.
-Yeah.

31:28.750 --> 31:30.208
-Thank you.
-Yup.

31:30.792 --> 31:32.750
Could you just hold the line, please?

31:32.833 --> 31:34.667
Would you do a photo shoot
for New York Magazine?

31:35.042 --> 31:36.917
-Nude?
-I don't think so.

31:37.000 --> 31:38.042
I'll do it anyway.

31:38.125 --> 31:40.500
-Now I need to go and collapse.
-Go rest, Mama.

31:57.958 --> 31:59.250
Hey, guys!

32:01.708 --> 32:03.375
I've missed you.

32:04.167 --> 32:05.833
Hi. Look what I've got.

32:07.042 --> 32:11.625
Chocolate and blackberry meringue
ice cream sandwiches!

32:13.167 --> 32:14.167
We can't.

32:16.292 --> 32:17.250
No way.

32:17.875 --> 32:18.750
What?

32:20.000 --> 32:22.542
We signed a contract with Dad.

32:22.625 --> 32:25.375
It's more commitment than a contract.

32:25.458 --> 32:26.292
That's true.

32:27.500 --> 32:28.333
Right.

32:28.417 --> 32:31.750
Let's eat these while we discuss
the ridiculousness of that.

32:33.333 --> 32:35.000
He said she'd do this.

32:35.542 --> 32:37.542
We just politely decline.

32:38.208 --> 32:40.000
We politely decline.

32:44.583 --> 32:46.167
You made them sign a contract?

32:47.000 --> 32:48.458
It's more of a commitment.

32:48.833 --> 32:50.417
They're kids. They should be having fun.

32:50.500 --> 32:52.833
Well, working towards a goal is fun.

32:52.917 --> 32:55.250
No. Ice cream sandwiches
at midnight is fun.

32:56.208 --> 32:57.958
Not when it's the enemy of the goal.

32:58.042 --> 33:00.917
You can't beat them
"into dank submission," to quote Bukowski.

33:01.000 --> 33:02.708
You're reading Bukowski to them,
by the way?

33:02.792 --> 33:04.250
-Well...
-They don't know what the fuck that means.

33:04.333 --> 33:06.833
They should be reading Harry Potter
or Dr. fucking Seuss.

33:06.917 --> 33:08.958
You seem a touch overwrought.

33:09.042 --> 33:11.042
I didn't think I'd have to fight
for the well being of my children.

33:11.125 --> 33:15.000
I thought I could trust you to mold them
in a kind and fucking nurturing way.

33:16.167 --> 33:18.083
Okay. Kids!

33:20.417 --> 33:22.833
Hi. You really don't
have to keep doing this.

33:22.917 --> 33:24.292
It's okay, guys.

33:24.375 --> 33:26.833
-We signed a contract.
-It's more of a commitment.

33:26.917 --> 33:27.917
Yeah, but you don't have to.

33:28.000 --> 33:29.917
But then what's the point of making it?

33:30.000 --> 33:31.167
What does that teach us?

33:31.708 --> 33:33.417
I mean, that's a fucking bad lesson.

33:33.500 --> 33:35.375
-Whoa!
-Whoa! Where's the f-bomb coming from?

33:35.458 --> 33:39.000
I just heard you rain 'em in on Dad and,
honestly, it sounded fucking cool.

33:39.083 --> 33:40.750
No, it fucking-- No, it didn't.

33:40.833 --> 33:42.417
Okay. Back to bed, you two.

33:47.583 --> 33:48.583
Nice, Ivy.

33:49.625 --> 33:50.708
I'm going to bed.

33:51.167 --> 33:53.375
Suppose the whole sex thing's
off the table?

33:53.458 --> 33:55.042
Yeah. Well intuited.

33:55.542 --> 34:01.458
How about a three-hour circular argument
that goes nowhere?

34:02.292 --> 34:03.208
Funny.

34:05.458 --> 34:07.458
Look, I'm sorry. I should have told you.

34:09.458 --> 34:11.667
We just have different ways with them.

34:11.750 --> 34:12.792
I miss them.

34:12.875 --> 34:15.042
Well, I could get them to run
to the shack tomorrow.

34:15.125 --> 34:16.625
They could do with the twelve mile hit out.

34:16.708 --> 34:18.458
Oh, my God.

34:18.958 --> 34:20.958
They weirdly quite like it.

34:22.500 --> 34:23.875
Okay. Sex.

34:23.958 --> 34:26.083
But get me off first so then I can sleep.

34:27.042 --> 34:28.958
You and your honeyed words.

34:32.125 --> 34:33.083
Feels good, right?

34:33.167 --> 34:34.417
-No!
-No!

34:34.500 --> 34:36.917
Pain is just weakness leaving the body.

34:37.000 --> 34:38.125
Come. Come on.

34:38.208 --> 34:39.292
Are we almost there?

34:39.375 --> 34:41.375
Yeah. Two kids.
They're heavenly creatures, really.

34:41.833 --> 34:43.292
I occasionally think they might
sprout wings

34:43.375 --> 34:46.458
and reveal themselves to be angels
and then fly back to heaven.

34:46.542 --> 34:47.750
Is David Chang really coming?

34:47.833 --> 34:49.667
-I think so, yeah.
-Wow.

34:49.750 --> 34:52.000
Can you just tilt that towards me
a little bit?

34:52.417 --> 34:53.375
Great.

34:54.292 --> 34:56.917
Oh, God. It's like a plague.

34:57.000 --> 34:58.458
Can you show me when you find some?

34:59.750 --> 35:00.750
How do they die?

35:01.167 --> 35:04.125
Well, the conditioner stuns them,
and then I take them off the comb

35:04.208 --> 35:06.417
and I break their backs.

35:06.750 --> 35:07.750
That's just awesome.

35:11.292 --> 35:13.583
-Hello?
-Hi! Guess where I am?

35:14.333 --> 35:16.125
Outside 'cause it's your turn
to look after the kids

35:16.208 --> 35:17.875
and help them with their homework
in half an hour?

35:17.958 --> 35:21.708
Not even close.
I'm on a jet to LA with David Chang.

35:21.792 --> 35:23.458
We did the photo shoot and he was like,

35:23.542 --> 35:26.583
"Fuck it! Let's go to LA
and have dinner with Nancy Silverton."

35:26.875 --> 35:29.292
-Right. Amazing.
-Isn't it? And then--

35:29.792 --> 35:31.875
Just some jamón
and more champagne for me, please?

35:32.458 --> 35:34.958
And then in the morning we're going to Malibu
to catch fish and grill on the beach.

35:35.042 --> 35:37.250
-It'll be on my Instagram.
-Be sure to look out for it.

35:37.333 --> 35:40.417
So, you're coming home when? Tomorrow?

35:40.500 --> 35:42.292
Yeah. I know I should've rung and asked.

35:42.375 --> 35:43.625
That would've been nice.

35:43.708 --> 35:45.333
And then I thought, ask what?
For permission?

35:45.417 --> 35:47.458
Because we just want to be the couple
who love each other

35:47.542 --> 35:50.500
and allow each other to grasp
the chances life gives us.

35:50.583 --> 35:51.417
Do we not?

35:51.500 --> 35:53.375
Yes. Rhetorical and entrapment.

35:53.458 --> 35:55.708
But yes, yes, yes.
No, no, of course we do. Yeah.

35:56.083 --> 35:58.708
Tell me, darling. How was your day?
And how are the kids?

35:58.792 --> 36:00.125
Well, the neighbor's dog shat
in the laundry.

36:00.208 --> 36:01.083
The kids have got nits.

36:01.167 --> 36:03.583
And my left eye is twitching 'cause
I'm so freakin' tired,

36:03.667 --> 36:05.375
-I've got a head cold, but you know--
-Sorry, darling. What did you say?

36:06.000 --> 36:08.250
Oh, no. Nothing. Nothing. You go have fun.

36:08.333 --> 36:10.583
I love you and your big, generous heart.

36:10.667 --> 36:11.708
Thank you.

36:12.125 --> 36:13.875
Love you, kids! Call you at bed time.

36:16.792 --> 36:18.292
Why are you so cross at her?

36:21.042 --> 36:22.250
'Cause I'm a dick.

36:29.958 --> 36:31.333
-Thanks, Leon. Bye.
-You're welcome.

36:31.417 --> 36:32.833
Don't be a dick. Don't be a dick.

36:32.917 --> 36:34.708
Don't be a dick. Be happy for her.

36:34.792 --> 36:36.250
Hey, my darling.

36:36.333 --> 36:38.083
-Hey, there.
-Hello.

36:38.167 --> 36:39.583
What a night. I had so much fun.

36:39.667 --> 36:41.917
I can't remember the last time I had fun.

36:42.375 --> 36:44.250
Right, that's awesome. Fun. It's awesome.

36:44.333 --> 36:47.792
And just amazing people to talk to.
People who do stuff, you know?

36:47.875 --> 36:49.875
Think stuff. Amazing stuff.

36:49.958 --> 36:53.708
Just out in the world, doing stuff.

36:56.375 --> 36:57.208
Really?

36:57.875 --> 36:59.125
Was that a tone?

36:59.208 --> 37:02.208
No, it's just washing
that I spent an hour on.

37:02.292 --> 37:04.417
I thought about shagging you
all the way back from the airport.

37:04.792 --> 37:06.667
Good. Indeed. Yes.

37:06.750 --> 37:07.833
It's just...

37:09.208 --> 37:10.750
I'm working my ass off.

37:11.125 --> 37:13.000
Oh, really?
You want do that instead of do me?

37:13.083 --> 37:14.167
'Cause I also work hard.

37:14.250 --> 37:15.542
And I appreciate it.

37:16.000 --> 37:17.917
-Do you?
-Yes, I do.

37:18.000 --> 37:21.167
Did you say I appreciate it when I said
I've been working my ass off?

37:21.250 --> 37:24.208
No. So, the question becomes: Do you?

37:25.167 --> 37:26.833
Yes, I appreciate it, darling.

37:27.333 --> 37:28.875
Seemed a little lackluster, like...

37:28.958 --> 37:30.500
I don't know, maybe
you were forced into it.

37:30.583 --> 37:32.917
I had fun, that's all.
Do you begrudge me that?

37:33.000 --> 37:34.958
Glad you had fun. Fucking awesome.

37:37.292 --> 37:38.333
I got you these.

37:41.000 --> 37:42.458
-You went to Bob's.
-Yeah.

37:42.875 --> 37:46.625
An hour and a half out of my way through
LA rush hour to get you Bob's Donuts.

37:47.167 --> 37:48.000
Oh, shit.

37:48.083 --> 37:50.042
Thoughtless of me, I know. What a bitch.

37:50.125 --> 37:52.667
This is a massive fucking victory for you,
isn't it?

37:52.750 --> 37:54.042
Oh, I fucking know it.

37:56.167 --> 37:58.083
I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry.

37:58.167 --> 38:00.417
It's because I was jealous
and I was begrudging your fun,

38:00.500 --> 38:02.125
which is not cool, not sexy.

38:02.208 --> 38:03.625
I know. It's okay.

38:04.333 --> 38:07.042
Eat up, buttercup. And then we're gonna
have some sugar-crusted sex.

38:08.625 --> 38:11.375
Is that mine? No, it's yours. It's Jane.

38:11.458 --> 38:15.458
She said, "Did you get the Bob's Donuts?
That donut ice cream idea is brilliant."

38:16.083 --> 38:18.917
"Let's test-kitchen it at ten a.m.
Kiss, kiss."

38:19.000 --> 38:20.167
Yeah.

38:20.250 --> 38:23.292
Well, no, 'cause they're for you,
but the first-- the first idea was you

38:23.375 --> 38:26.500
and then the second idea
was the-- was the ice cream idea, but--

38:27.750 --> 38:28.750
For sure.

38:28.833 --> 38:30.458
42, 43,

38:30.542 --> 38:33.917
44, 45, 46, 47,

38:34.000 --> 38:36.417
48, 49, 50.

38:37.500 --> 38:38.833
I like their bling.

38:38.917 --> 38:40.667
They literally never take them off.

38:40.750 --> 38:42.875
Why would you when you're state champions?

38:43.292 --> 38:44.958
Revel in the glory, I say.

38:45.042 --> 38:46.083
We are!

38:46.167 --> 38:48.667
Though one day,
the glory will end, however...

38:48.750 --> 38:50.167
The work goes on!

38:54.625 --> 38:56.417
I gotta say, you guys don't seem great.

38:56.500 --> 38:59.250
Yeah. Very discordant energies here.

38:59.333 --> 39:00.958
-Right?
-Yeah. Right.

39:01.042 --> 39:02.208
That was intuitive, Barry.

39:02.292 --> 39:03.500
-Thanks, babe.
-That was good.

39:03.583 --> 39:05.583
So, how bad is it, Theo?

39:05.958 --> 39:07.083
What?

39:07.167 --> 39:09.833
It's... Everything's great.

39:09.917 --> 39:13.583
You know, the shack's a monster success,
and the kids are killing it.

39:14.167 --> 39:15.833
They won't actually let themselves
stop a workout

39:15.917 --> 39:17.625
until they're dizzy and throwing up.

39:17.708 --> 39:19.083
-So that's... that's commitment.
-Yeah.

39:19.167 --> 39:23.208
And I'm actually-- I'm really loving it.

39:23.792 --> 39:24.625
Yeah.

39:25.083 --> 39:27.750
But you are still a failure.
Women don't like that.

39:30.667 --> 39:32.250
-I sense trouble.
-Same.

39:32.333 --> 39:33.833
Yeah. Yeah.

39:34.958 --> 39:38.500
If you need a shoulder...
or an inner thigh to lean on.

39:38.583 --> 39:39.583
Yeah.

39:40.042 --> 39:40.958
What?

39:41.750 --> 39:42.958
Barr, I'm kidding.

39:44.833 --> 39:46.583
I will fuck you.

39:53.958 --> 39:55.833
Ivy and I are just fine.

39:57.875 --> 39:59.167
It's intense, right?

39:59.250 --> 40:00.667
-How did they--
-I don't know.

40:00.750 --> 40:01.833
How?

40:02.542 --> 40:04.292
So, is everything okay?

40:04.833 --> 40:06.000
What? Yeah, why?

40:07.750 --> 40:11.083
There just seems an undercurrent
of discontent between you.

40:11.917 --> 40:14.000
You could float a boat in that current.

40:14.083 --> 40:16.667
What? Really?
Well, I'm so busy, I haven't noticed.

40:16.750 --> 40:20.167
Ivy. You must cherish
and nourish a relationship.

40:20.250 --> 40:22.708
Don't you blow random truck drivers
in our car park?

40:23.042 --> 40:24.583
And for that ten minutes...

40:25.375 --> 40:27.917
...I cherish and I nourish them.

40:29.292 --> 40:30.250
We're fine.

40:34.458 --> 40:36.917
-Everybody seems to think--
-We hate each other?

40:37.000 --> 40:41.458
Well, "undercurrent of discontent,"
was the phrase, but yes. Crazy.

40:41.542 --> 40:43.583
I suppose sometimes I do hate you.

40:43.667 --> 40:44.500
Funny.

40:44.583 --> 40:45.583
No, seriously.

40:46.083 --> 40:47.500
-What?
-Don't you have that?

40:47.583 --> 40:52.000
When your whole body is seized
by dizzying waves of fucking hatred?

40:52.083 --> 40:53.167
Jesus!

40:53.250 --> 40:54.958
Really? You don't have that?

40:55.042 --> 40:56.417
I thought we all did, married people.

40:56.500 --> 40:58.750
And, you know, you just have to let it go.

40:58.833 --> 41:03.125
And it'll pass like a wave crashes
somewhere on a beach in the Pacific.

41:04.167 --> 41:05.667
I mean, put aside taking it personally.

41:05.750 --> 41:07.542
Put aside the dizzying hatred
you have for me?

41:07.625 --> 41:10.292
Sporadic dizzying hatred.

41:11.000 --> 41:12.667
You really don't feel like that
about me at all?

41:12.750 --> 41:14.375
Well, I-- The other day I did think

41:14.458 --> 41:17.792
if Charles Manson invited me on a picnic
and if you invited me on a picnic,

41:17.875 --> 41:19.042
I'd go with Charlie.

41:19.417 --> 41:20.500
Charles Manson.

41:21.042 --> 41:22.458
Yeah, Charles Manson on a good day.

41:22.833 --> 41:24.583
What, a jamming with the Beach Boys day

41:24.667 --> 41:27.250
as opposed to plotting
a murderous rampage day?

41:27.625 --> 41:29.167
Don't take it personally.

41:32.292 --> 41:33.125
Manson.

41:33.208 --> 41:34.542
Yeah, you're right.
I think we both have it.

41:34.958 --> 41:35.875
Right.

41:36.917 --> 41:40.958
Do you think we should try and find out
why we have it?

41:41.917 --> 41:44.333
Well, no, not if it's normal, no. No.

41:44.417 --> 41:45.458
Right. Okay.

41:46.542 --> 41:48.417
It's work. It's too much work.

41:48.500 --> 41:50.083
And the kids. I mean, I love them,

41:50.167 --> 41:52.458
but they are draining the marrow
of my fucking soul.

41:52.542 --> 41:55.083
And I-- I still love us.

41:55.417 --> 41:57.208
Oh, I hate everyone but us.

41:57.292 --> 41:59.333
Me too. I miss you.

41:59.667 --> 42:00.917
I miss you.

42:01.208 --> 42:02.375
We should do something.

42:02.458 --> 42:03.542
Is it run away?

42:07.750 --> 42:10.708
No kids. No work.

42:11.875 --> 42:13.792
New York. Just you and me.

42:15.042 --> 42:17.292
I feel giddy at the thought of it.

42:17.375 --> 42:18.500
Cheers.

42:19.125 --> 42:20.667
I'm so tired.

42:22.500 --> 42:23.500
Sleep.

42:24.417 --> 42:26.083
No, I want to be with you.

42:26.167 --> 42:28.750
Sleep.

42:29.917 --> 42:31.208
I've got you.

42:49.208 --> 42:50.125
Theo.

42:51.708 --> 42:52.708
Hi!

42:53.458 --> 42:54.292
Sally.

42:54.708 --> 42:56.000
-Hello.
-How are you?

42:56.083 --> 42:58.458
I am really good, thank you, yes.

42:58.542 --> 43:00.625
-How... how are you?
-Amazing.

43:00.708 --> 43:03.042
I'm just designing
this psychotic new campus

43:03.125 --> 43:04.708
for one of the tech firms
in Silicon Valley.

43:04.792 --> 43:05.833
-Wow.
-Yeah.

43:05.917 --> 43:07.292
That's... that's great.

43:08.250 --> 43:09.708
Yeah. You?

43:11.292 --> 43:12.667
Freelancing.

43:12.958 --> 43:14.792
That's cool.

43:14.875 --> 43:17.500
Oh, my God. That fucking video.

43:17.917 --> 43:18.750
"It's not going to fall."

43:18.833 --> 43:20.542
"It's-- It's not going to fall."

43:20.625 --> 43:22.083
So-- So-- So funny.

43:22.167 --> 43:23.917
So long ago,
I've actually forgotten about it.

43:24.000 --> 43:25.292
I think most people have.

43:25.375 --> 43:26.792
No one has, man.

43:27.375 --> 43:29.708
-I mean, not in our business.
-I--

43:29.792 --> 43:31.667
Enough about you. Check this out.

43:34.542 --> 43:35.750
Do you wanna know the budget?

43:35.833 --> 43:37.708
-Sure. Sure.
-I can't tell you.

43:43.333 --> 43:44.417
Fuck.

43:45.250 --> 43:47.333
Fuck!

43:48.917 --> 43:50.083
You all right in there?

43:51.375 --> 43:53.500
Hello, there.
I'd like two Scotches, please.

43:54.042 --> 43:55.083
I heard a noise.

43:55.167 --> 43:56.875
Was there a noise? Are we in danger?

43:56.958 --> 43:58.333
-No, I--
-Oh, a relief.

43:58.417 --> 43:59.833
So, two Scotches?

44:04.583 --> 44:05.417
Should I wake her?

44:07.958 --> 44:09.417
In a thoughtful marriage,

44:09.500 --> 44:13.167
a good partner drinks the other's drink
while they sleep.

44:17.833 --> 44:19.500
I think she'll have another.

44:20.375 --> 44:21.625
As will I.

44:29.708 --> 44:32.042
-Sir, please!
-Give it... back!

44:32.125 --> 44:34.833
No! Sir, I'm gonna ask you one more time.

44:34.917 --> 44:37.125
-Give it back!
-No, sir, please!

44:37.208 --> 44:40.250
-She's stolen my drawings.
-What's going on? Theo?

44:40.333 --> 44:43.083
She stole my drawings
and then threw them in the trash.

44:43.167 --> 44:47.375
-I was just doing my job.
-Your job is not to make things disappear.

44:47.458 --> 44:49.542
Jesus, Theo, how drunk are you?

44:49.625 --> 44:52.208
Jesus yourself drunk actually.

44:52.583 --> 44:53.583
What?

44:54.500 --> 44:55.958
You see? Told you.

44:57.167 --> 44:59.125
Oh, thank God. Have you got a taser?

45:02.333 --> 45:03.375
How's the hangover?

45:06.167 --> 45:08.458
Distracting me from the humiliation.

45:09.708 --> 45:11.417
Sorry about all that.

45:11.500 --> 45:12.417
It's fine.

45:14.208 --> 45:15.542
Dinner's not for a few hours.

45:17.917 --> 45:19.375
Ollie Dabbous saw my Instagram

45:19.458 --> 45:22.250
and has invited me to his pop-up
and then dinner's not till eight.

45:22.333 --> 45:23.708
Oh, no.

45:24.000 --> 45:25.583
I'd love it if you came.

45:25.667 --> 45:27.583
You... you go, darling.

45:27.667 --> 45:30.125
They're so much fun,
so it would be fun, not work.

45:30.583 --> 45:31.750
I-- I think--

45:32.750 --> 45:34.667
I think I'm gonna just, you know...

45:35.875 --> 45:39.500
...catch up with a golf score
that I don't really care about.

45:42.583 --> 45:45.917
Look, go be fanned, have fun.
I'll see you at dinner.

45:48.458 --> 45:51.125
Okay. Back by dinner.

46:05.542 --> 46:07.333
Okay. We won't be kissing later today.

46:10.667 --> 46:12.667
That's just too pretty.

46:17.125 --> 46:18.250
That's amazing.

46:23.458 --> 46:24.750
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

46:25.333 --> 46:27.667
You built some lovely fucking buildings.

46:27.958 --> 46:29.208
Good for you.

46:41.667 --> 46:42.667
Thank you!

46:53.500 --> 46:55.083
-Thank you.
-All right, lady.

46:56.917 --> 46:58.208
Theo!

46:58.292 --> 46:59.458
Theony.

46:59.542 --> 47:01.958
Theodorus. Theo.

47:03.292 --> 47:04.125
Hey.

47:05.208 --> 47:06.708
Life throws some hits.

47:06.792 --> 47:08.000
People go down.

47:08.667 --> 47:11.083
Some get up and some don't
and that's when you suddenly go,

47:11.167 --> 47:13.792
"Oh, shit. I got one of the ones
that don't get up."

47:14.458 --> 47:17.208
No, I do get up for our children.

47:17.292 --> 47:19.417
In the middle of the night
and in the morning--

47:19.500 --> 47:21.500
Don't be a little bitch about it.
It was just a comment.

47:22.042 --> 47:23.250
I'm gonna be sick.

47:29.667 --> 47:30.875
Beautiful.

47:33.875 --> 47:36.708
Anyway... I don't wanna
make a deal of it.

47:37.708 --> 47:40.958
But I am fucking done having it
running in the back of our lives.

47:41.833 --> 47:45.500
You failed, so either get over it
or get on top of it.

47:46.042 --> 47:47.333
Okay, will do.

47:51.667 --> 47:53.083
Just gonna lie down here.

47:53.792 --> 47:54.917
Yeah, you do that.

47:55.625 --> 47:58.292
I'll try to resist
dropping something heavy on you.

48:20.417 --> 48:22.333
Fuck-headed idiot, Ivy.

48:22.417 --> 48:23.667
Just go and apologize.

48:25.625 --> 48:26.708
Drunken idiot.

48:28.542 --> 48:29.458
Jesus.

48:46.792 --> 48:50.792
I mean, it's a lot of pressure
and slightly unrealistic

48:50.875 --> 48:54.167
to expect a person to perfectly
articulate their thoughts

48:54.250 --> 48:55.958
in a measured way in a long marriage.

48:57.000 --> 48:59.292
Is... Is that a "sorry"?

48:59.375 --> 49:02.083
Yes and also a philosophical musing.

49:04.458 --> 49:06.750
I'm sorry, I don't want to talk anymore.

49:08.417 --> 49:09.542
Seems mature.

49:33.042 --> 49:35.458
Do these kids have any actual clothes?

49:42.917 --> 49:44.167
I love these.

49:44.750 --> 49:46.083
Dream house.

49:46.167 --> 49:47.375
Thank you.

49:48.833 --> 49:50.667
Maybe we should switch back.

49:50.750 --> 49:51.792
We always intended to.

49:52.208 --> 49:53.417
You know, I-- I'll go back to work,

49:53.500 --> 49:55.250
and you can go back
to what you always love doing,

49:55.333 --> 49:59.625
cooking for eleven people in an evening
and smoking joints by the sea.

50:01.583 --> 50:03.167
Can you get a job?

50:03.500 --> 50:04.333
Whoa.

50:04.417 --> 50:07.708
I mean that in a neutral
information-seeking way.

50:07.792 --> 50:11.000
Well, I'd have to start
at the bottom again, I guess.

50:11.083 --> 50:12.042
You know?

50:12.542 --> 50:14.375
Can't bear the thought of it,
but I will, I must,

50:14.458 --> 50:17.250
because that is what I was meant to do.

50:17.833 --> 50:21.292
By the way, I met someone in New York
who wants to become an equity partner

50:21.375 --> 50:23.833
and open more restaurants
like David Chang.

50:24.750 --> 50:25.750
Yeah.

50:26.833 --> 50:29.583
So, you... you don't want to swap back.

50:30.250 --> 50:31.958
As a feminist, I can't.

50:32.042 --> 50:33.750
And as someone who loves their job

50:33.833 --> 50:37.333
and is addicted to public adoration,
I can't.

50:37.417 --> 50:41.708
Right. So I need this and you need that.

50:43.083 --> 50:48.292
So someone has to sacrifice themselves
on the altar of the marriage, but...

50:49.417 --> 50:51.208
...who's it gonna be?

50:57.750 --> 50:58.708
Unless--

50:58.792 --> 51:00.292
Oh, my God,
did you love that pregnant pause?

51:00.375 --> 51:02.250
I wasn't sure if you were gonna give in.
Were you gonna give in?

51:02.333 --> 51:04.000
-I--
-Well, no, best not to answer.

51:04.417 --> 51:07.083
So, I've seen something
which I think might help us.

51:08.042 --> 51:08.875
Come on.

51:10.167 --> 51:11.708
-Nearly there.
-Okay.

51:12.500 --> 51:13.375
Okay.

51:14.083 --> 51:15.417
Okay, stop there.

51:17.542 --> 51:18.417
Okay, look.

51:23.333 --> 51:24.667
Wow.

51:25.250 --> 51:28.250
I want you to build us
the most amazing house ever.

51:28.333 --> 51:29.792
Here? Now?

51:32.167 --> 51:34.208
What about my ego death and my shitty job?

51:34.292 --> 51:37.375
And slowly working back
and having my redemption?

51:37.458 --> 51:39.542
What about showing the world
you're a genius?

51:39.625 --> 51:41.667
And you that I'm not a failure.

51:41.958 --> 51:43.375
You were born to build things.

51:44.875 --> 51:45.792
Can we afford this?

51:46.083 --> 51:47.583
If I do my expansion we can.

51:47.667 --> 51:49.542
Ivy, this is...

51:51.083 --> 51:52.250
Go on, say it. I think I've earned it.

51:52.333 --> 51:53.333
Wow!

52:16.208 --> 52:19.125
And we should be able
to see the sea all the time.

52:19.208 --> 52:20.833
Of course.

52:25.292 --> 52:28.500
One, two, three, four.

52:28.583 --> 52:30.167
One, two...

52:30.250 --> 52:32.125
-Keep it going!
-...three, four.

52:35.292 --> 52:36.625
Theo!

52:37.250 --> 52:38.167
Oh, wow.

52:38.250 --> 52:40.542
-I--
-This is gonna be amazing.

52:41.625 --> 52:43.250
-It's pretty beautiful, isn't it?
-Are you kidding me?

52:44.458 --> 52:45.875
Ivy gave you your balls back.

52:45.958 --> 52:47.583
It does feel like a second chance.

52:47.917 --> 52:50.583
-Yeah.
-You know, when I was 29,

52:50.667 --> 52:53.500
I was diagnosed
with an autoimmune disorder.

52:54.083 --> 52:57.125
Yeah. It was awful, I... I lost my mind.

52:57.208 --> 53:00.292
-I was acting out sexually, it was...
-Babe, we've talked about this.

53:00.375 --> 53:02.958
Chronic yeast infections are not
an autoimmune disorder.

53:03.417 --> 53:04.583
Well, it still stung, Barr.

53:04.667 --> 53:06.125
The point is, Theo, this is it.

53:06.208 --> 53:09.042
You're gonna reset everything, nail it,
and live happily ever after.

53:09.125 --> 53:11.625
Just wanna make something
worthy of Ivy, you know,

53:11.708 --> 53:15.792
so she knows that I wasn't
a massive fucking mistake.

53:16.125 --> 53:17.042
-Right.
-That's so sweet.

53:17.125 --> 53:18.292
Let me give you a hug. Come here.

53:18.750 --> 53:20.417
You sweet thing.

53:21.458 --> 53:24.250
-Someone needs a hug.
-Thank you.

53:25.875 --> 53:30.375
Yes, this-- Things seem to be
deviating from hug territory.

53:31.042 --> 53:32.958
We're opening the marriage.

53:34.542 --> 53:36.792
That's still under negotiation,
knucklehead.

53:37.542 --> 53:38.375
Babe?

53:39.083 --> 53:39.917
Babe?

53:40.833 --> 53:41.708
Babe.

53:41.792 --> 53:44.667
I'm just at the house.
When do we open Chicago again?

53:45.458 --> 53:46.917
You have a call with them at four.

53:47.000 --> 53:49.333
Also, I'm sending you
this week's house bills,

53:49.417 --> 53:52.500
and if I may provide
personal commentary...

53:52.583 --> 53:54.500
Fuck, man. You have to rein him in.

53:54.583 --> 53:56.375
But I want him to have his shot.
I mean--

53:58.292 --> 54:00.667
-Oh, fuck!
-Exactly.

54:01.917 --> 54:03.750
Twenty-eight grand for Irish moss, Theo?

54:03.833 --> 54:05.292
Yeah, it's for the west side roof.

54:05.375 --> 54:06.875
Does America not have moss?

54:06.958 --> 54:09.292
Well, the green of the Irish moss
is something to behold.

54:09.375 --> 54:11.208
Look, the green it takes
to pay for the Irish moss

54:11.292 --> 54:12.667
is also something to behold.

54:12.750 --> 54:15.375
We need it. It is integral for the vision.

54:16.542 --> 54:20.000
Do you understand
that we do not have unlimited money?

54:21.458 --> 54:24.833
Did I show you the tree enclosed
in a glass case off the kitchen idea?

54:26.708 --> 54:27.833
That's mean.

54:28.250 --> 54:29.125
Oh, my God.

54:29.958 --> 54:30.792
Wanker!

54:38.042 --> 54:39.375
Ivy...

54:39.458 --> 54:42.792
which of these three tiles do you...
do you like the look of?

54:43.375 --> 54:46.458
They're to go behind the...
the wood burner, so...

54:46.542 --> 54:47.458
I love it.

54:47.542 --> 54:49.708
But there are three of them.
Which "it"?

54:49.792 --> 54:51.125
-Yeah, I'll send them now.
-There are three "its"--

54:51.208 --> 54:52.875
You didn't even look at them.

54:53.500 --> 54:55.542
-What?
-And I'm trying to talk to you

54:55.625 --> 54:56.667
-and you're picking up the ph--
-Hi.

54:56.750 --> 54:59.042
Yeah, I just told Flora,
budget figures are in.

54:59.125 --> 55:00.375
Oh, budget figures, yeah.

55:00.458 --> 55:02.083
-While you're on budgetary figures...
-Call you back.

55:02.167 --> 55:04.958
...please will you add in
that I bought us a table

55:05.042 --> 55:06.833
from a 15th century Spanish monastery?

55:06.917 --> 55:09.708
It actually has a dagger embedded in it
from the Spanish Inquisition.

55:09.792 --> 55:12.125
It's pricey, but I think it's essential.
Feel like the look of--

55:12.542 --> 55:13.375
Ivy!

55:25.625 --> 55:27.042
Just checking.

55:27.125 --> 55:28.542
Jesus Christ, Ivy.

55:29.375 --> 55:32.708
You are a fucking child sometimes.

55:33.333 --> 55:34.542
Mom? Dad?

55:36.250 --> 55:37.417
Do we have any milk?

55:38.708 --> 55:40.083
-Yes, darling, of course we have milk.
-Yeah. Of course, darling. Yeah.

55:40.167 --> 55:41.250
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

55:41.875 --> 55:42.833
Yeah.

55:47.417 --> 55:50.917
And a one, and a two, and a three, four.

55:51.000 --> 55:52.167
Hello!

55:52.833 --> 55:53.833
Mom?

55:53.917 --> 55:55.375
I'm coming too.

55:55.458 --> 55:57.333
Okay. Great.

55:58.000 --> 56:00.125
Mom, we're doing two-k interval
wind sprints.

56:02.417 --> 56:03.667
Also, news.

56:04.875 --> 56:07.083
I had my first period yesterday.

56:07.583 --> 56:09.208
My darling. Were you all right?

56:09.583 --> 56:11.958
I was in a white bathing suit
at a pool party.

56:12.042 --> 56:13.250
It was mortifying.

56:13.583 --> 56:15.708
People stared, I cried.

56:16.542 --> 56:17.875
Why didn't you call me?

56:18.542 --> 56:20.625
I called Dad. He was the best.

56:21.958 --> 56:23.042
The best.

56:23.500 --> 56:24.750
How did you know what to do?

56:25.458 --> 56:26.958
Intuitive parenting.

56:27.583 --> 56:28.708
He Googled it.

56:28.792 --> 56:31.208
All right, you two. And, go!

56:37.625 --> 56:39.500
Can't believe that about her period.

56:39.583 --> 56:40.917
Yeah, it was intense.

56:41.750 --> 56:43.292
She was a wreck, poor thing.

56:44.042 --> 56:45.417
Wish I'd been there.

56:46.125 --> 56:47.625
But you never are, are you?

56:49.542 --> 56:52.208
Shut your stupid, stupid mouth.

56:56.750 --> 56:58.042
Dad!

56:58.125 --> 56:59.167
You coming?

57:03.375 --> 57:04.208
Yup.

57:19.583 --> 57:21.792
-Hey, Mom.
-Hello, darling.

57:21.875 --> 57:23.542
You look beautiful.

57:24.917 --> 57:26.750
-Glowing.
-Sweat.

57:27.875 --> 57:29.958
-What were you doing?
-Free-climbing fences

57:30.042 --> 57:32.500
to build my lat muscles
and general focus.

57:34.458 --> 57:35.375
Cool.

57:36.708 --> 57:37.917
You avoiding Dad?

57:38.208 --> 57:40.458
No, of course not.
I'm just having a little moment.

57:40.833 --> 57:42.208
You two need help.

57:43.292 --> 57:44.208
Ridiculous.

57:46.542 --> 57:49.292
Hattie, it's time for your protein blast.

57:49.375 --> 57:51.042
Don't tell him I'm--
Don't tell him I'm here.

57:51.625 --> 57:52.958
Mom's down here.

57:53.542 --> 57:54.625
Traitor.

57:55.917 --> 57:56.875
Sorry.

57:58.375 --> 57:59.542
I still love you, though.

57:59.875 --> 58:00.875
Love you, too.

58:12.042 --> 58:14.167
Do you ever feel like
we're trapped in something?

58:14.250 --> 58:16.542
That we've created
this overly complicated,

58:16.625 --> 58:19.000
endlessly whirring machine
that we can't get out of?

58:19.958 --> 58:23.083
What if we just dropped it all, got a van,
and drove around South America?

58:23.167 --> 58:26.417
Yeah, well, you'd have
a hard time convincing them.

58:27.083 --> 58:29.250
They're aiming
for those scholarships in Miami.

58:29.333 --> 58:32.667
But that's what I mean. They're 13,
and suddenly they want to leave home.

58:33.875 --> 58:35.625
They were six, last time I looked.

58:36.542 --> 58:37.958
Look, you're just tired.

58:40.625 --> 58:42.208
We're in the hard bit.

58:42.292 --> 58:44.833
Good, 'cause if this is the easy bit,
smother me with a pillow.

58:44.917 --> 58:46.000
Will do.

58:46.917 --> 58:48.917
Said a little too quickly for my liking.

58:50.583 --> 58:53.417
...complete deadshit.
A victim. A loser. A wanker.

58:53.500 --> 58:55.792
Number ten. "Theo. What a cunt."

58:57.708 --> 58:59.583
That wasn't the task.

59:00.000 --> 59:02.000
I see so much resentment,

59:02.083 --> 59:05.917
self-righteousness, mockery,
an inability to admit wrongs.

59:06.208 --> 59:09.333
I don't think you have the capacity
to fix your problems.

59:12.750 --> 59:15.458
Are you actually allowed to say that?

59:15.542 --> 59:16.917
That seems unprofessional.

59:17.000 --> 59:18.833
Yes. Like malpractice.

59:18.917 --> 59:21.917
-What? No...
-We'll be expecting a hefty discount.

59:22.292 --> 59:24.208
-Time's up.
-Really?

59:24.833 --> 59:27.167
-Well, that was fun while it lasted.
-That was so much fun.

59:27.250 --> 59:29.792
I do still expect my parking
to be validated.

59:33.375 --> 59:35.958
-Outrageous.
-Absolute fraud.

59:36.042 --> 59:37.667
-Your list was best, by the way.
-Thank you, darling.

59:37.750 --> 59:39.083
Yours was second-best.

59:39.875 --> 59:41.583
We could be nicer.

59:42.375 --> 59:43.750
I could be.

59:43.833 --> 59:44.833
Me too.

59:45.250 --> 59:46.250
Let's try.

59:50.625 --> 59:51.625
Dad! We got in!

59:51.708 --> 59:53.542
Miami! We both got in!

59:53.625 --> 59:55.167
-We got our scholarships!
-Yes!

59:55.250 --> 59:57.708
My little genii. Yes. Yes!

59:57.792 --> 59:59.958
Let's have some pancakes
to celebrate. We did it.

01:00:00.042 --> 01:00:01.583
The work goes on.

01:00:01.667 --> 01:00:02.708
Yes.

01:00:04.625 --> 01:00:05.708
Miss you already.

01:00:05.792 --> 01:00:06.833
Bring it in, champ.

01:00:06.917 --> 01:00:08.250
-Bye.
-Bye, darling.

01:00:08.333 --> 01:00:09.375
Love you.

01:00:10.167 --> 01:00:12.583
-We'll call you guys when we get there.
-Yes, please do.

01:00:12.667 --> 01:00:14.208
-Okay.
-Yes, please.

01:00:14.292 --> 01:00:17.625
Now, don't forget to do
that stretching regime I told you

01:00:17.708 --> 01:00:19.375
after you get off the plane, please?

01:00:20.625 --> 01:00:21.458
-Bye.
-Bye.

01:00:21.542 --> 01:00:22.542
-Bye.
-Bye.

01:00:22.917 --> 01:00:25.417
-Love you. Love you.
-Bye, love you.

01:00:32.333 --> 01:00:33.500
Bye.

01:00:37.167 --> 01:00:38.625
Well, thank God they've gone.

01:00:40.375 --> 01:00:42.000
Theo, I'm joking.

01:00:45.292 --> 01:00:47.125
It's Hattie. Yes?

01:00:47.208 --> 01:00:50.458
I forgot, can you...
walk me through the nutrition thing again?

01:00:50.542 --> 01:00:52.417
Yes. Yes, nutrition, yes, of course.

01:00:52.500 --> 01:00:54.833
Well, you know,
it's a little bit like being a rabbit

01:00:54.917 --> 01:00:56.875
at a Las Vegas buffet.

01:00:56.958 --> 01:00:59.708
You want to be hitting
the salad bar first, yes? Correct?

01:01:01.542 --> 01:01:02.958
Yes and then--

01:01:03.042 --> 01:01:05.583
So, think like a rabbit,
eat lots of vegetables, and then...

01:01:05.667 --> 01:01:08.417
So, you gotta be very careful
about your blood sugar spikes.

01:01:08.500 --> 01:01:10.875
So, you can have your protein
and then you can have your carbs

01:01:10.958 --> 01:01:12.208
like a cross-country trucker.

01:01:12.292 --> 01:01:14.917
Yeah, Jane, let's open another restaurant.

01:01:31.667 --> 01:01:32.875
Light the fire, please, Hal.

01:01:33.625 --> 01:01:35.833
And turn up the music, five percent.

01:01:44.583 --> 01:01:46.583
That looks great. You want champagne?

01:01:46.667 --> 01:01:49.000
No, thank you, I've been
making out with my negroni.

01:01:49.083 --> 01:01:50.250
Think I'll stick to that.

01:01:51.292 --> 01:01:54.458
Car approaches. Silver Audi.
Two guests.

01:01:54.542 --> 01:01:55.667
Still freaky how he does that.

01:01:56.083 --> 01:01:57.000
Thanks, Hal.

01:01:57.333 --> 01:01:58.958
Hal, do you want a negroni?

01:01:59.042 --> 01:02:01.125
I don't have wants or needs.

01:02:01.208 --> 01:02:02.375
Marry me.

01:02:03.125 --> 01:02:04.125
Funny.

01:02:09.333 --> 01:02:11.917
I mean, wow.

01:02:13.292 --> 01:02:14.625
The green moss on the roof,

01:02:14.708 --> 01:02:17.458
the blue thrust of the house
meeting the raw ocean.

01:02:17.542 --> 01:02:20.333
I mean, I love how the living area

01:02:20.417 --> 01:02:23.500
provides this kind of gravitational
center of the ensemble.

01:02:23.583 --> 01:02:26.417
You guys are saying words, but you know
they don't mean anything, right?

01:02:26.500 --> 01:02:29.542
You got a shot at your vision, Theo,
and you nailed it.

01:02:30.125 --> 01:02:34.708
I never thought watching a white man
reclaim his power could be so moving.

01:02:43.833 --> 01:02:44.833
How are you?

01:02:47.000 --> 01:02:48.500
So great.

01:02:48.583 --> 01:02:50.500
The house is just--

01:02:50.583 --> 01:02:53.250
It's... It's so beautiful.

01:02:53.333 --> 01:02:54.750
He's a fucking genius.

01:02:56.500 --> 01:02:59.375
Why is this stove old and kinda crappy?

01:03:00.583 --> 01:03:01.417
It's not.

01:03:01.500 --> 01:03:04.250
It's Julia Child's original stove
from France.

01:03:04.333 --> 01:03:05.292
I bought it at auction.

01:03:05.375 --> 01:03:07.083
-Stop it.
-I know.

01:03:08.167 --> 01:03:09.250
It's a fragile beauty.

01:03:09.333 --> 01:03:11.083
Wow. That is incredible.

01:03:11.167 --> 01:03:13.167
-Julia Child.
-Yeah.

01:03:13.250 --> 01:03:14.792
She's dead, right?

01:03:14.875 --> 01:03:16.625
And what, was kind of mean?

01:03:17.042 --> 01:03:18.958
No. You should probably go
and join the others,

01:03:19.042 --> 01:03:21.875
'cause I'm shaving fennel, and it takes
a high degree of concentration

01:03:21.958 --> 01:03:24.333
not to just shred my wrists
into the salad.

01:03:32.375 --> 01:03:34.542
Don't you ever just wanna let go?

01:03:34.625 --> 01:03:37.750
Well, that's why the English
invented repressing one's feelings.

01:03:37.833 --> 01:03:39.042
You're so dry.

01:03:39.708 --> 01:03:41.750
Only when my husband looks at me.

01:03:42.500 --> 01:03:43.833
-There you go again.
-Oh, yeah.

01:03:45.792 --> 01:03:47.292
Close your eyes. Close your eyes.

01:03:54.542 --> 01:03:55.625
Love you, baby girl.

01:03:55.958 --> 01:03:58.750
This would be a cool place
to suicide from.

01:03:59.333 --> 01:04:00.208
So pretty.

01:04:00.792 --> 01:04:01.917
I'm going back inside.

01:04:02.000 --> 01:04:04.792
I wanna see how the wall asserts itself
with such clarity into the space.

01:04:04.875 --> 01:04:06.083
I wanna see that too.

01:04:06.167 --> 01:04:10.417
Well, my friend, you have made
what I like to call a very adequate house.

01:04:10.500 --> 01:04:12.583
-I am flattered.
-Sorry to gush.

01:04:12.667 --> 01:04:15.375
The fact that you'll now be sad
every time you walk into your own home

01:04:15.458 --> 01:04:16.750
is enough for me.

01:04:16.833 --> 01:04:18.750
That was the case long
before you built this.

01:04:19.500 --> 01:04:21.167
Speaking of, how's married life?

01:04:22.167 --> 01:04:24.458
It's... it's fine.

01:04:25.125 --> 01:04:26.167
That bad, huh?

01:04:26.250 --> 01:04:27.625
I was hoping the house would be healing

01:04:27.708 --> 01:04:29.542
-in its quietly adequate way.
-Yeah.

01:04:29.625 --> 01:04:32.000
How old is that fucking stove, Theo?

01:04:32.083 --> 01:04:34.125
Just ignore the fucking stove.

01:04:34.208 --> 01:04:36.458
Seems a little passive aggressive, no?

01:04:36.542 --> 01:04:39.875
All this beauty, she gets that bitch
Julia Child's stove in there?

01:04:40.458 --> 01:04:42.792
No, sometimes a stove is just a stove.

01:04:43.125 --> 01:04:44.500
The stove sounds bad, The.

01:04:45.208 --> 01:04:46.375
It-- it's fine.

01:04:46.667 --> 01:04:49.125
Hey, baby, can you get me a negroni?

01:04:49.208 --> 01:04:50.583
You already have a negroni.

01:04:50.958 --> 01:04:52.417
That's why God gave me two hands.

01:04:52.500 --> 01:04:55.167
I thought it was so you could give me
a handjob while enjoying a negroni.

01:04:56.208 --> 01:04:57.167
Obviously, I'm joking.

01:04:57.250 --> 01:04:59.000
She's sickened by the sight
of my naked body.

01:05:00.750 --> 01:05:01.917
Fucking adore you.

01:05:02.000 --> 01:05:03.208
Barr.

01:05:07.208 --> 01:05:08.750
These people...

01:05:09.167 --> 01:05:11.458
Wait... Okay, please say it again.

01:05:12.042 --> 01:05:14.125
Every morning, he'd order
a tumbler of whiskey and four kippers

01:05:14.208 --> 01:05:16.833
-and be beastly to the staff.
-Oh, my God, I love it.

01:05:16.917 --> 01:05:19.125
Is kipper a kind of sex act?

01:05:19.208 --> 01:05:21.292
If you're a Tory MP, absolutely.

01:05:21.375 --> 01:05:22.958
But I don't know what that means.

01:05:23.042 --> 01:05:25.958
Who cares, Sal? It just sounds so good.

01:05:26.250 --> 01:05:28.958
All this time,
I'm still falling for that little accent.

01:05:29.833 --> 01:05:31.500
It does something to my...

01:05:31.958 --> 01:05:32.917
Cunt?

01:05:34.667 --> 01:05:36.333
Sorry, were you not gonna say cunt?

01:05:36.750 --> 01:05:37.833
My mistake. Anyway...

01:05:37.917 --> 01:05:39.417
Dinner! Let's eat.

01:05:39.708 --> 01:05:41.625
-Another negroni?
-No, thanks, darling. I've got one.

01:05:41.708 --> 01:05:42.833
Was my point.

01:05:42.917 --> 01:05:45.167
Too subtle for someone
who's had four negronis.

01:05:46.292 --> 01:05:48.500
Can I point out the gorgeous
wooden elephant in the room?

01:05:49.167 --> 01:05:51.667
I love this table. I mean, come on.

01:05:52.167 --> 01:05:54.292
Yes. 15th century
from a Spanish monastery.

01:05:54.375 --> 01:05:57.292
Apparently that dagger was used
in the Spanish Inquisition.

01:05:57.375 --> 01:05:58.917
How cool is that?

01:05:59.000 --> 01:06:02.208
This was likely covered
in a tortured heretic's blood?

01:06:02.833 --> 01:06:04.917
Do you just wake up beaming, Ivy?

01:06:05.000 --> 01:06:05.958
I really do.

01:06:06.042 --> 01:06:07.000
We are very lucky.

01:06:07.083 --> 01:06:08.500
So much to be grateful for.

01:06:08.583 --> 01:06:11.333
Here's to this amazing house
and to you, my darling.

01:06:11.417 --> 01:06:12.917
-No, to you.
-No, to you.

01:06:13.000 --> 01:06:15.083
No. To you.

01:06:16.542 --> 01:06:18.667
You guys are so cute.

01:06:18.750 --> 01:06:20.625
Like a sack of kittens.

01:06:20.708 --> 01:06:22.125
Near a rushing river.

01:06:22.667 --> 01:06:23.750
I don't get that.

01:06:24.042 --> 01:06:27.042
Thank you, Ivy,
for making all of this possible.

01:06:28.125 --> 01:06:30.250
He sounds sarcastic,
but he does actually mean it.

01:06:30.333 --> 01:06:31.292
Yeah, it's just the accent.

01:06:31.375 --> 01:06:33.583
The accent is confusing.

01:06:33.667 --> 01:06:35.958
Sometimes Ivy's mad at me,
and I can't even tell.

01:06:36.792 --> 01:06:39.208
Sometimes he's got his cock in me,
and I can't even tell.

01:06:50.542 --> 01:06:53.292
All right, now the dinner is getting fun.

01:06:53.375 --> 01:06:56.167
So, Ives, you want me to, what,
do a shot of this with the scallop?

01:06:56.250 --> 01:06:59.333
Yeah, it's, um, Japanese vodka
infused with tarragon,

01:06:59.417 --> 01:07:00.875
so adds a bit of bitterness.

01:07:01.333 --> 01:07:04.417
Ivy likes to leave a little bit of herself
in everything she does.

01:07:07.917 --> 01:07:09.917
I love this fun banter you guys do.

01:07:10.000 --> 01:07:11.583
We should try it, Sally, come on.

01:07:12.667 --> 01:07:13.542
Okay.

01:07:13.625 --> 01:07:15.250
Why don't you try
not fucking me in the ass

01:07:15.333 --> 01:07:17.292
while you choke me sometimes, shitbird?

01:07:19.750 --> 01:07:20.750
Your turn.

01:07:20.833 --> 01:07:22.042
Whore.

01:07:23.875 --> 01:07:24.750
That kinda thing?

01:07:26.208 --> 01:07:27.833
That is so cool.

01:07:28.333 --> 01:07:30.375
Is that what you guys are doing, right?

01:07:30.458 --> 01:07:31.750
I'm not the expert.

01:07:31.833 --> 01:07:32.708
Ivy?

01:07:35.958 --> 01:07:37.833
See, this is why I don't have friends.

01:07:37.917 --> 01:07:40.667
You know, you gotta get
Architectural Digest up here, right?

01:07:40.750 --> 01:07:44.250
Thank you, Sally, I'm not so sure
I'm into public approbation.

01:07:47.333 --> 01:07:48.208
Anymore.

01:07:50.333 --> 01:07:51.208
Sure.

01:07:52.417 --> 01:07:54.542
The kids have been gone
for a while now, huh?

01:07:54.625 --> 01:07:55.917
How has that been?

01:07:57.125 --> 01:07:59.708
Hard? Brutal? Liberating?

01:07:59.792 --> 01:08:01.292
Your kids are college-age already?

01:08:01.375 --> 01:08:02.375
Oh, no, no, no.

01:08:02.458 --> 01:08:04.125
They just happen
to be very gifted physically,

01:08:04.208 --> 01:08:06.167
and they won these scholarships
to this school in Miami

01:08:06.250 --> 01:08:07.667
for high performance athletes.

01:08:07.750 --> 01:08:09.125
At 13.

01:08:09.208 --> 01:08:11.417
-Amazing.
-Yeah. It's their dream.

01:08:11.708 --> 01:08:12.875
Is it?

01:08:13.833 --> 01:08:16.375
I think I know how you feel,
because when we hired that surrogate,

01:08:16.457 --> 01:08:19.542
and she got pregnant,
and then she ate sushi from an airport,

01:08:19.625 --> 01:08:21.500
-and we had to let her go.
-Here we go.

01:08:21.582 --> 01:08:23.542
It was very dark. I got shingles.

01:08:23.625 --> 01:08:26.375
I got monkey pox. The grief I felt.

01:08:28.792 --> 01:08:31.667
Yeah-- I-- It's still pretty raw for me.

01:08:32.250 --> 01:08:33.542
I hear you, baby girl.

01:08:33.625 --> 01:08:36.667
So is that nine restaurants
you guys have now?

01:08:37.125 --> 01:08:38.457
We are an empire.

01:08:38.542 --> 01:08:40.625
And she won the James Beard Award...

01:08:40.707 --> 01:08:42.542
-Yass.
-...which is like a food Oscar.

01:08:42.625 --> 01:08:44.375
-It's all true.
-I'm aware of the Beard.

01:08:44.457 --> 01:08:46.792
We've been lucky.
We found a niche in the market.

01:08:46.875 --> 01:08:48.500
Upscale, but not intimidating.

01:08:48.582 --> 01:08:50.500
So, it sort of hits a range
of demographics.

01:08:50.875 --> 01:08:52.832
We want to move into the South.

01:08:52.917 --> 01:08:55.750
Like Sherman's march with lobster bibs.

01:08:55.832 --> 01:08:57.792
Sorry, darling, was the attention off you
for a minute?

01:08:57.875 --> 01:08:59.167
Did you start to wilt?

01:08:59.250 --> 01:09:01.000
I think the guests are wilting,
my darling,

01:09:01.082 --> 01:09:05.500
due to the droning nature
of your caustic narcissism.

01:09:07.582 --> 01:09:09.582
They're doing it again, and I love it.

01:09:10.457 --> 01:09:12.667
Hey, fuck-stick bitch, fill my glass

01:09:12.750 --> 01:09:15.582
the way you can't fill my pussy
with your tiny dick.

01:09:16.042 --> 01:09:17.042
Whoa.

01:09:18.292 --> 01:09:20.207
All right, that doesn't seem like banter.

01:09:20.292 --> 01:09:21.667
That just seems mean to me.

01:09:21.750 --> 01:09:25.125
Cry like a baby like you did
when our dog died, dickhead.

01:09:25.582 --> 01:09:27.125
What the fuck?

01:09:28.332 --> 01:09:33.250
I am an empath,
and I'm having a hard time at this table.

01:09:44.667 --> 01:09:46.957
Can you not? Amy's allergic to weed.

01:09:47.500 --> 01:09:49.417
I'm allergic to Amy, literally.

01:09:49.500 --> 01:09:50.707
Rash on my finger.

01:09:50.792 --> 01:09:53.207
Funny. Can we just be nice, please?

01:09:53.292 --> 01:09:55.708
You're drunk, and you're being a...

01:09:55.792 --> 01:09:58.125
if I had to define it in one word,
a bit of a bitch.

01:09:58.583 --> 01:09:59.542
Of course, darling.

01:10:01.375 --> 01:10:04.458
We've done something amazing here.
Let's celebrate it.

01:10:05.542 --> 01:10:06.542
Any dessert?

01:10:06.625 --> 01:10:08.833
Hal, play Napalm Death.

01:10:11.208 --> 01:10:13.292
Ivy, it's a little loud.

01:10:24.125 --> 01:10:25.375
It's the house.

01:10:26.208 --> 01:10:27.417
Oh, my God.

01:10:27.500 --> 01:10:29.500
For you. For you. For you.

01:10:29.583 --> 01:10:31.250
Baby girl, double helping.

01:10:47.625 --> 01:10:50.375
I'm gonna leave some long pauses
in the conversation,

01:10:50.458 --> 01:10:52.667
for you to insert an apology.

01:10:52.750 --> 01:10:53.917
For what, darling?

01:10:55.208 --> 01:10:56.458
You embarrassed yourself.

01:10:57.417 --> 01:10:59.375
Sorry you feel that way.
I did it for you, darling.

01:11:00.000 --> 01:11:01.875
You're an appalling, needy bore,

01:11:01.958 --> 01:11:05.292
and I created a diversion
lest they should think ill of you.

01:11:05.375 --> 01:11:08.125
I shall insert some pauses
for you to thank me.

01:11:10.125 --> 01:11:12.583
You just can't say sorry, can you?

01:11:12.667 --> 01:11:14.333
Well, I did.
I said I'm sorry you feel that way.

01:11:15.125 --> 01:11:15.958
That's not sorry.

01:11:16.042 --> 01:11:18.292
Well, the sentence literally
contains the word, "sorry."

01:11:20.125 --> 01:11:22.542
You can't say sorry with feeling,

01:11:23.375 --> 01:11:27.417
with acknowledgment for pain caused
or damage done.

01:11:27.500 --> 01:11:29.583
Jesus, I'm not fucking Ian McKellen.

01:11:29.667 --> 01:11:33.042
I'm so sorry. My deepest regrets, sir.

01:11:36.708 --> 01:11:38.250
Yeah, well, I'm touched.

01:11:39.125 --> 01:11:40.542
Did you try the cake?

01:11:41.708 --> 01:11:44.458
Jesus, Theo, it's no big deal.
I got drunk at dinner.

01:11:44.542 --> 01:11:47.125
You stole my fucking children from me,
and now they're gone.

01:11:47.208 --> 01:11:48.833
You expect me to be happy about it?

01:11:48.917 --> 01:11:51.333
I did not steal our children.

01:11:51.917 --> 01:11:53.083
But I did bring them up.

01:11:53.167 --> 01:11:54.583
You taught them how to be sweaty robots.

01:11:54.667 --> 01:11:57.167
They can only talk about reps
or sodium levels or some shit,

01:11:57.250 --> 01:11:58.333
and now they've gone.

01:11:58.417 --> 01:12:00.375
Yeah, well, you should've thought
about that when you were off to work

01:12:00.458 --> 01:12:04.042
building your fucking empire,
i.e. a shrine to yourself.

01:12:04.125 --> 01:12:06.625
I did that to pay for this,
your shrine to yourself.

01:12:06.708 --> 01:12:08.333
It was meant to be ours, but became yours.

01:12:08.417 --> 01:12:11.000
That is bullshit because I was prepared
to work my way up again,

01:12:11.083 --> 01:12:14.042
but you bribed me with this house
to serve the Ivy show.

01:12:14.125 --> 01:12:16.875
And you can't even see what I did
for the children.

01:12:16.958 --> 01:12:20.167
The doctor's appointments, the dentist's
appointments, the dermatologist.

01:12:20.250 --> 01:12:21.625
Who went to the dermatologist?

01:12:21.958 --> 01:12:23.833
Fuck! Seriously?

01:12:25.167 --> 01:12:27.250
Yeah, no, I-- I remember the thing.

01:12:27.333 --> 01:12:29.167
The thing. What thing? Whose thing?

01:12:29.250 --> 01:12:31.375
The thing. The thing
that was skin-related that...

01:12:32.458 --> 01:12:34.833
Whose? Who had it, Ivy?
I mean, there's just two of them.

01:12:34.917 --> 01:12:36.292
You've got a 50-50 chance.

01:12:36.375 --> 01:12:37.458
Roy!

01:12:37.542 --> 01:12:39.250
I'm afraid you're out of the game, madam.

01:12:39.333 --> 01:12:41.625
Hattie, cracked and bleeding
eczema on her toes.

01:12:41.708 --> 01:12:42.708
Yes...

01:12:45.125 --> 01:12:46.042
What is happening?

01:12:46.125 --> 01:12:49.125
Have you lost your footing
on the cliff of resentment

01:12:49.208 --> 01:12:52.250
as you realize
there is no factual basis to it?

01:12:52.333 --> 01:12:55.958
I would have loved to have been
the one that did that, is my point.

01:12:57.292 --> 01:12:59.042
You know why I can't say sorry?

01:12:59.542 --> 01:13:00.375
Enlighten me.

01:13:00.458 --> 01:13:02.250
Because you need it too much.

01:13:02.333 --> 01:13:06.292
You need sorry, and praise, and attention,
and blowjobs, and Italian furniture,

01:13:06.375 --> 01:13:08.333
and Irish fucking moss
on the fucking roof!

01:13:08.417 --> 01:13:10.667
You are a bottomless pit of need!

01:13:17.208 --> 01:13:18.583
Yeah, well, you're right.

01:13:20.333 --> 01:13:21.333
I am?

01:13:21.875 --> 01:13:22.708
Yeah.

01:13:23.958 --> 01:13:25.583
What do you mean, I'm right?

01:13:25.667 --> 01:13:27.958
I do need connection.

01:13:28.708 --> 01:13:30.542
And an exchange of intimacy

01:13:31.208 --> 01:13:34.208
and the flawed nature
of who I am validated

01:13:34.292 --> 01:13:36.625
as I journey through this life hoping

01:13:36.708 --> 01:13:40.875
that one person might see me,
love me, and hold me.

01:13:46.125 --> 01:13:47.542
Oh, I see.

01:13:47.625 --> 01:13:49.875
You're the wise philosopher,
and I'm the bitch.

01:13:49.958 --> 01:13:51.667
Exactly. And I'm out.

01:13:51.750 --> 01:13:53.208
The victor.

01:14:14.625 --> 01:14:16.333
Theo, I'm so sorry.

01:14:20.083 --> 01:14:22.417
I'm so sad, it just hollows me out.

01:14:23.500 --> 01:14:25.792
I feel like I've missed half their lives.

01:14:26.417 --> 01:14:28.375
And I don't know what to do without them.

01:14:33.542 --> 01:14:36.083
I just-- I think I just want you
to give me a hug

01:14:36.167 --> 01:14:37.875
or something pathetic like that.

01:14:51.708 --> 01:14:52.542
Morning.

01:14:53.167 --> 01:14:55.375
Think I might just go for a run.

01:15:22.375 --> 01:15:23.667
Shit.

01:15:27.542 --> 01:15:29.875
You-- You're in the wrong place, buddy.

01:15:33.750 --> 01:15:34.875
Are you dead?

01:15:54.667 --> 01:15:55.833
Wait there.

01:15:56.750 --> 01:15:58.917
Stop. Will you stop, please?

01:15:59.000 --> 01:16:00.583
Please, please, stop, stop, stop.

01:16:02.958 --> 01:16:04.000
Stop!

01:16:08.167 --> 01:16:09.000
Good run?

01:16:14.250 --> 01:16:15.125
Yeah.

01:16:16.125 --> 01:16:17.375
Yeah, fine.

01:16:20.417 --> 01:16:21.708
Just gonna shower.

01:16:25.083 --> 01:16:25.917
Hey, Jane.

01:16:29.083 --> 01:16:30.042
He did what?

01:16:34.417 --> 01:16:35.875
You saved a whale?

01:16:37.458 --> 01:16:38.708
I wasn't alone.

01:16:39.042 --> 01:16:40.625
Are you fucking kidding me?

01:16:41.042 --> 01:16:43.375
You're angry because you hate whales?

01:16:43.458 --> 01:16:45.208
You didn't tell me.

01:16:46.208 --> 01:16:47.792
-No.
-Why not?

01:16:48.958 --> 01:16:49.792
You looked busy.

01:16:50.167 --> 01:16:52.375
Don't play that card.
I asked you how was your run,

01:16:52.458 --> 01:16:55.625
and you said, "Fine,"
not, "Fine, I saved a whale."

01:16:55.708 --> 01:16:57.792
-I--
-Just tell me why you didn't tell me.

01:17:01.458 --> 01:17:02.958
Didn't want you to ruin it.

01:17:04.000 --> 01:17:05.417
How would I ruin it?

01:17:05.500 --> 01:17:09.042
Because you don't take anything seriously,
and it was serious.

01:17:09.125 --> 01:17:11.375
And actually quite spiritual.

01:17:12.333 --> 01:17:14.667
Try me. I can be deeply spiritual.

01:17:14.750 --> 01:17:17.250
I masturbate to Deepak Chopra meditations.

01:17:17.333 --> 01:17:19.667
-Think you proved my point.
-Oh, please.

01:17:19.750 --> 01:17:22.958
I know I can be a bit of an arse,
but give me a chance.

01:17:30.333 --> 01:17:31.375
Well...

01:17:37.042 --> 01:17:40.000
I had my hands on this beautiful creature,

01:17:40.083 --> 01:17:42.958
and it was like we were communicating.

01:17:45.750 --> 01:17:48.208
As I was standing in the water
with the whale,

01:17:48.292 --> 01:17:50.417
surrounded by these people, and...

01:17:53.958 --> 01:17:56.417
It just felt like everything was one.

01:17:57.792 --> 01:18:00.042
Us, the whale, the sea.

01:18:01.458 --> 01:18:03.875
And something happened...

01:18:05.792 --> 01:18:07.667
...deep in our core.

01:18:09.875 --> 01:18:11.708
And it was beautiful.

01:18:13.375 --> 01:18:15.750
And then I was still standing there,

01:18:16.708 --> 01:18:19.500
waist-deep in the water,
watching him swim away.

01:18:23.250 --> 01:18:24.250
And...

01:18:25.875 --> 01:18:28.500
I started crying, just because it was...

01:18:34.625 --> 01:18:35.542
I just...

01:18:36.583 --> 01:18:37.875
...was happy.

01:18:40.958 --> 01:18:42.792
You cried? That's beautiful.

01:18:44.958 --> 01:18:48.375
And then this question rose up inside me.

01:18:48.792 --> 01:18:50.083
What was it? This is amazing.

01:18:50.167 --> 01:18:52.125
This is so you. It's like the old you.

01:18:53.042 --> 01:18:56.625
It was, "You only have one life.

01:18:57.792 --> 01:19:01.375
So why the fuck are you with Ivy?"

01:19:05.250 --> 01:19:06.375
Jesus.

01:19:07.458 --> 01:19:09.042
I don't mean to be mean.

01:19:09.125 --> 01:19:12.500
I've been trying to push it away,
'cause I don't wanna ask the question,

01:19:12.583 --> 01:19:13.750
but I know the answer.

01:19:13.833 --> 01:19:14.708
I have to go.

01:19:14.792 --> 01:19:16.250
To somewhere where you're not talking.

01:19:16.333 --> 01:19:17.833
We're done, Ivy.

01:19:18.375 --> 01:19:19.875
I fucking say when we're done.

01:19:19.958 --> 01:19:23.125
Fuck you and your suicidal
attention-seeking whale friend.

01:19:23.208 --> 01:19:25.500
I'm being serious, we are done.

01:19:25.583 --> 01:19:26.542
Look at us.

01:19:26.625 --> 01:19:29.417
Fine. We're done.
But we're done because I decided it!

01:19:29.500 --> 01:19:30.583
Not you.

01:19:45.750 --> 01:19:47.958
You are--
You are a good lawyer, right?

01:19:48.042 --> 01:19:50.833
Yeah. I mean, mostly real estate,

01:19:50.917 --> 01:19:53.000
but divorce is mostly about real estate.

01:19:53.583 --> 01:19:55.125
What, so you-- you've never done this?

01:19:55.208 --> 01:19:58.458
Not exactly, but they're pretty much
all the same. Relax.

01:20:01.125 --> 01:20:02.875
-It's a sad day, man.
-Yeah.

01:20:03.708 --> 01:20:05.542
How do you and Amy make it work?

01:20:05.625 --> 01:20:07.458
I don't know. Inertia.

01:20:07.542 --> 01:20:09.625
What? I thought you guys were good.

01:20:10.000 --> 01:20:11.750
No, we are. We're good.

01:20:12.750 --> 01:20:15.708
It's like, when we were young,

01:20:15.792 --> 01:20:18.250
it was like I knew what she was gonna say
before she even said it.

01:20:19.042 --> 01:20:23.417
And now, sometimes I don't know
what she said even after she says it.

01:20:24.125 --> 01:20:25.000
Right.

01:20:25.083 --> 01:20:27.458
But, you know, I love her.

01:20:28.000 --> 01:20:30.000
So, there's that.

01:20:31.375 --> 01:20:33.500
All right. Let's win this thing.

01:20:33.583 --> 01:20:34.542
Yes.

01:20:40.125 --> 01:20:41.625
Don't talk.

01:20:44.917 --> 01:20:47.500
-Bruno, sit.
-Sorry, what is happening?

01:20:47.583 --> 01:20:49.083
Eleanor, you cannot bring in the dog.

01:20:49.167 --> 01:20:50.833
It's my emotional support animal.

01:20:50.917 --> 01:20:52.792
It's a dangerous dog.

01:20:53.333 --> 01:20:54.667
Only when it feels I'm threatened.

01:20:54.750 --> 01:20:56.708
It's a bullshit tactic, and you know it.

01:20:58.167 --> 01:21:00.667
Isn't this a bit of a weird cliché?

01:21:00.750 --> 01:21:03.667
You know,
the ferocious divorce lawyer thing.

01:21:03.750 --> 01:21:04.750
Yeah, but just...

01:21:06.000 --> 01:21:07.417
Ivy, is this him?

01:21:08.167 --> 01:21:10.292
Yeah, this is him. My name's Theo.

01:21:11.208 --> 01:21:12.667
Well, this is a personal aside,

01:21:12.750 --> 01:21:15.125
but the fact she ever let you fuck her

01:21:15.208 --> 01:21:17.375
should be enough for her
to claim every dollar.

01:21:17.708 --> 01:21:19.125
-Wow.
-Jesus.

01:21:19.208 --> 01:21:22.167
Okay, let me lay it out
before this putz bores me to death.

01:21:22.250 --> 01:21:25.083
She has been living and supporting
this bottom feeding piece of shit,

01:21:25.167 --> 01:21:27.417
carrying his endless fucking failures

01:21:27.500 --> 01:21:30.375
and needy, "Mummy help me"
anguish for 15 years.

01:21:30.458 --> 01:21:32.250
So just agree you'll fuck off now,

01:21:32.333 --> 01:21:34.375
we'll never see you again,
and she'll throw you a hundred grand.

01:21:34.875 --> 01:21:36.208
Okay...

01:21:37.375 --> 01:21:40.833
My thoughts, how about we take
25% of the restaurants

01:21:40.917 --> 01:21:42.667
and the house, and we'll be good?

01:21:43.333 --> 01:21:45.750
Okay, look, I just want the house.

01:21:45.833 --> 01:21:47.292
-Don't talk.
-You're not having the house.

01:21:47.375 --> 01:21:50.333
Don't talk. Okay, well that seems like
in our ballpark, so let's--

01:21:50.417 --> 01:21:53.000
Okay, wait, my client designed and built

01:21:53.083 --> 01:21:55.625
that award-winning fucking house,

01:21:55.708 --> 01:22:00.250
that your sociopathic whore hole
of a client now claims as hers.

01:22:00.333 --> 01:22:02.125
-Barry!
-Barry! Whore hole?

01:22:02.458 --> 01:22:03.958
What? I thought the lawyers
were being mean.

01:22:04.042 --> 01:22:05.375
Isn't that-- No?

01:22:05.458 --> 01:22:07.875
It's part of the theater.
Please don't talk, it's very undermining.

01:22:07.958 --> 01:22:09.292
Let's be a little bit more British
about this.

01:22:09.375 --> 01:22:10.792
Polite, courteous, rational.

01:22:10.875 --> 01:22:12.250
Yeah, it's not like it's in our blood

01:22:12.333 --> 01:22:15.250
to pillage, murder, and enslave
other cultures to get what we want.

01:22:15.333 --> 01:22:16.583
-Don't talk.
-Don't talk.

01:22:17.917 --> 01:22:20.042
Okay, we want everything. The end.

01:22:20.125 --> 01:22:21.250
That's not negotiating.

01:22:21.333 --> 01:22:22.375
No, it's winning.

01:22:22.458 --> 01:22:25.000
Hundred grand, and he walks out of here
with his face still attached.

01:22:25.083 --> 01:22:26.125
Right, Bruno?

01:22:28.625 --> 01:22:31.583
You can't have the house, Ivy.
I designed it. I built it.

01:22:31.917 --> 01:22:34.292
It's all I want.
You can have everything. Everything else.

01:22:34.375 --> 01:22:36.458
I take the house.
We walk out of here, firm handshake,

01:22:36.542 --> 01:22:38.292
-and get on with our lives.
-We'll take it.

01:22:38.375 --> 01:22:39.708
-No.
-No?

01:22:39.792 --> 01:22:42.375
You want the divorce,
I want the house.

01:22:47.458 --> 01:22:48.667
We are winning here.

01:22:48.750 --> 01:22:50.708
You get the company, buy a new house.

01:22:50.792 --> 01:22:51.625
No.

01:22:51.917 --> 01:22:53.125
I can hear what they're saying.

01:22:53.208 --> 01:22:55.375
Okay, we get the house, too. The end.

01:22:55.458 --> 01:22:57.208
No! No deal.

01:22:57.292 --> 01:22:59.625
Bruno, sit and shut up.

01:23:05.000 --> 01:23:06.000
So, what? We're nowhere.

01:23:06.083 --> 01:23:07.208
Looks like it.

01:23:09.792 --> 01:23:12.000
Barry, are you and Amy going
to the Harvest Moon Festival?

01:23:12.333 --> 01:23:13.250
Yeah, Amy loves it.

01:23:13.333 --> 01:23:14.167
I do, too.

01:23:14.250 --> 01:23:15.917
It's a little bit too much
tribal drumming for me

01:23:16.000 --> 01:23:17.208
'cause I have tinnitus,
but we'll be there.

01:23:17.292 --> 01:23:20.250
-Good.
-Sorry, can we please focus on us?

01:23:23.333 --> 01:23:24.583
All right. Fine. Yes.

01:23:25.250 --> 01:23:27.208
But I'm speaking as your friend now.

01:23:29.375 --> 01:23:30.875
Maybe rethink this, guys.

01:23:31.667 --> 01:23:32.500
I mean...

01:23:33.583 --> 01:23:37.000
I know a lot has gone down,
but you're great.

01:23:37.750 --> 01:23:38.958
And you're great together.

01:23:39.917 --> 01:23:42.708
I mean, sure, some days it feels horrible,
and you want to skin each other alive,

01:23:42.792 --> 01:23:45.417
but some days it doesn't, right?

01:23:45.500 --> 01:23:46.958
It's nice to have someone.

01:23:47.792 --> 01:23:48.958
And my advice would be...

01:23:50.167 --> 01:23:51.708
try to focus on those days,

01:23:51.792 --> 01:23:54.792
nod when you wanna shake your head,
and just say, "What the fuck?"

01:23:56.208 --> 01:23:58.917
And always think of other people
when you have sex.

01:24:00.375 --> 01:24:01.750
That's standard.

01:24:04.750 --> 01:24:05.875
You can make it.

01:24:08.833 --> 01:24:11.583
Well, that was just lovely, Barry.

01:24:12.208 --> 01:24:14.083
We're still getting the fucking house.

01:24:14.167 --> 01:24:15.375
Let's go, Ivy.

01:24:18.125 --> 01:24:21.458
She's really good... at law.

01:24:30.958 --> 01:24:33.750
I will pick you apart
until you beg me to take this house.

01:24:33.833 --> 01:24:36.708
Well, I can endure a lot of misery.
That's proven.

01:24:36.792 --> 01:24:39.375
You have no idea
how nice I've been to you, mister.

01:24:39.458 --> 01:24:41.125
I'm getting the house, Ivy.

01:24:41.208 --> 01:24:43.167
I designed it, and I built it.

01:24:43.250 --> 01:24:44.917
And I paid for it.

01:25:10.417 --> 01:25:12.292
-What are you burning?
-Your cookbooks.

01:25:12.875 --> 01:25:18.000
This is a 1907 first edition of Escoffier,
French wanker cookbook.

01:25:18.083 --> 01:25:21.042
This one I've covered in brandy,
so I think the correct term is, "flambé."

01:25:23.458 --> 01:25:25.667
Incoming call from Hattie and Roy.

01:25:25.750 --> 01:25:27.250
-Have you told them?
-I didn't have the heart.

01:25:27.333 --> 01:25:28.333
Me neither.

01:25:29.000 --> 01:25:29.917
Answer.

01:25:30.875 --> 01:25:32.292
Hi, Mom. Hi, Dad.

01:25:32.375 --> 01:25:33.500
Hi!

01:25:33.583 --> 01:25:36.292
Hey. We hear you're getting divorced.

01:25:37.667 --> 01:25:38.500
How?

01:25:38.875 --> 01:25:40.000
Barry's Instagram.

01:25:42.875 --> 01:25:44.125
We're so happy for you.

01:25:44.875 --> 01:25:45.792
-You...
-What?

01:25:46.125 --> 01:25:47.458
We've dreamed about this.

01:25:47.542 --> 01:25:49.792
We just wanted to say
we admire your courage

01:25:49.875 --> 01:25:53.000
to release each other
from the nightmarish death spiral

01:25:53.083 --> 01:25:54.833
that you've been in for the past decade.

01:25:56.167 --> 01:25:58.000
Gotta run. Literally. 32k.

01:25:58.083 --> 01:25:59.333
-Love you! Bye!
-Talk to you.

01:26:05.000 --> 01:26:05.875
What is that?

01:26:06.500 --> 01:26:08.125
I'm burning your green moss.

01:26:08.625 --> 01:26:09.667
Lovely color smoke.

01:26:09.750 --> 01:26:11.875
You wouldn't get that from American moss.

01:26:18.958 --> 01:26:22.250
Hey, Hal. Play polka at full volume
on loop in room 14.

01:26:22.333 --> 01:26:23.875
No Ivy override.

01:26:27.333 --> 01:26:29.917
Hal! Turn it off!

01:26:30.000 --> 01:26:32.208
-Lock door of room 14.
-Hal! Turn it off!

01:26:32.292 --> 01:26:34.167
-For five hours.
-Theo!

01:26:34.958 --> 01:26:37.375
You asshole! Theo!

01:26:37.875 --> 01:26:39.542
-Turn volume down, Hal.
-Oh, my God!

01:26:39.625 --> 01:26:41.833
Ivy, here's an agreement
giving me the house.

01:26:41.917 --> 01:26:43.292
Please sign it.

01:26:43.375 --> 01:26:44.917
Full volume please, Hal.

01:26:45.000 --> 01:26:47.375
-Sorry, darling. Can't hear you.
-I'm going to do a shit on your pillow!

01:26:47.458 --> 01:26:48.583
Fuck you!

01:26:49.542 --> 01:26:51.500
-Amy?
-Hi. You okay?

01:26:52.125 --> 01:26:54.917
Barry was worried you guys were
trying to destroy each other.

01:26:55.750 --> 01:26:56.750
Only if necessary.

01:26:56.833 --> 01:27:00.125
I'm hoping she'll see reason
when her ears start bleeding.

01:27:01.167 --> 01:27:03.250
Gotta check your energy. Excuse me.

01:27:03.667 --> 01:27:04.708
Sorry.

01:27:06.125 --> 01:27:08.417
That's very dark, Theo. Very dark.

01:27:08.875 --> 01:27:11.792
I need it, Amy. I am getting the house.

01:27:11.875 --> 01:27:16.083
But what's a house compared to the house
that is our bodies?

01:27:16.708 --> 01:27:20.375
Maybe you gotta drive to Mexico
with a friend.

01:27:20.750 --> 01:27:24.542
And we take peyote. We drink tequila.

01:27:24.625 --> 01:27:26.958
And we rub and we rub.

01:27:27.042 --> 01:27:31.250
And then we get taco after taco
after taco.

01:27:31.917 --> 01:27:33.625
Muy caliente.

01:27:33.708 --> 01:27:37.250
Okay. Thank you for the kind offer,
if confused metaphor,

01:27:37.333 --> 01:27:39.583
but I am not leaving my house.

01:27:45.958 --> 01:27:49.458
Would you really just up and leave Barry?

01:27:50.250 --> 01:27:53.000
Leave Barry? What? No, no, no.

01:27:53.083 --> 01:27:55.917
I'm looking for one night
of strange, okay?

01:27:56.000 --> 01:28:00.875
So that I can forget that I'm 40-whatever
and my face is melting off.

01:28:00.958 --> 01:28:05.667
And my organs are probably brewing up
a Stage IV something as we speak.

01:28:05.750 --> 01:28:08.708
But, I know who I want
driving me to chemo

01:28:08.792 --> 01:28:11.667
and that's my big, dumb,
stupid husband, Barry.

01:28:13.833 --> 01:28:15.917
Anyway, call me when you get rational.

01:28:29.333 --> 01:28:30.750
Hal, it's Ivy.

01:28:30.833 --> 01:28:32.292
Yes, Ivy.

01:28:33.875 --> 01:28:35.750
Can you open my calendar, please?

01:28:35.833 --> 01:28:36.917
Oh, fuck.

01:28:37.000 --> 01:28:40.792
All our fish orders are cancelled
for the entire chain across the country?

01:28:41.375 --> 01:28:42.250
My diary's blank.

01:28:42.333 --> 01:28:43.792
-For today?
-Every day.

01:28:44.667 --> 01:28:48.125
Why have we ordered two tons of Cheez Whiz
and four tons of marshmallow?

01:28:48.208 --> 01:28:50.250
-Fucker.
-It's exciting. Whatever it is.

01:28:50.333 --> 01:28:51.667
You mad genius.

01:28:57.125 --> 01:28:58.708
Oh, good. You're awake.

01:28:58.792 --> 01:29:01.000
Look, I've been teaching myself AI.

01:29:01.083 --> 01:29:02.458
It's you.

01:29:02.542 --> 01:29:05.875
Let me tell you a funny, funny secret.

01:29:07.042 --> 01:29:10.125
I deliberately fucked the building up.

01:29:10.708 --> 01:29:14.375
Yep. I engineered it to come apart,
like fucking Lego.

01:29:14.458 --> 01:29:16.417
People have to learn nothing's solid.

01:29:16.500 --> 01:29:17.875
Apart from this rock.

01:29:18.625 --> 01:29:20.500
Is... is that a crack pipe?

01:29:21.375 --> 01:29:23.917
It's called deepfake. Isn't it fun?

01:29:24.000 --> 01:29:25.458
Also, the end of Western civilization.

01:29:25.542 --> 01:29:27.042
Ivy, what are you doing with...
Is that my--

01:29:27.125 --> 01:29:28.500
Your phone? Yeah, well feared.

01:29:28.583 --> 01:29:31.750
I'm going to send this
to all of your clients captioned,

01:29:31.833 --> 01:29:32.792
"Smoke the truth, bitches."

01:29:32.875 --> 01:29:34.917
Unless you sign the house over to me now.

01:29:35.000 --> 01:29:36.292
Funny. You--

01:29:36.833 --> 01:29:38.167
Too slow!

01:29:39.417 --> 01:29:40.375
Oh, fuck.

01:29:40.458 --> 01:29:42.000
You look cute when beaten.

01:29:42.083 --> 01:29:44.750
Hey, how you doing? Eat more food.

01:29:44.833 --> 01:29:46.875
Hi. Thank you so much.
So nice to see you.

01:29:50.167 --> 01:29:51.042
Hi, Ivy.

01:29:51.125 --> 01:29:55.208
Every winter,
I get this wart between my toes.

01:29:55.292 --> 01:29:59.625
It's fucking brilliant when grated
into your ragout.

01:29:59.708 --> 01:30:03.042
Add in the simple mushroom.
Shroomy-shroom-shroom-shrooms!

01:30:03.125 --> 01:30:06.458
Sign the fucking papers, Ivy,
or it will never end.

01:30:06.542 --> 01:30:07.583
Jesus, no!

01:30:07.667 --> 01:30:10.167
And the mole. Well, it's brown.

01:30:10.250 --> 01:30:12.833
-Mole is go.
-No! No go. Mole is no go.

01:30:13.500 --> 01:30:15.292
-What are you doing?
-Who's had the mushrooms?

01:30:16.625 --> 01:30:17.500
Everybody.

01:30:23.083 --> 01:30:25.042
No, no! Absolutely not. Don't eat it.

01:30:25.500 --> 01:30:26.792
No, don't. Give me those!

01:30:26.875 --> 01:30:28.292
No, sorry. Don't eat that!

01:30:28.375 --> 01:30:30.083
No, no, no, no.

01:30:30.167 --> 01:30:31.667
Put your clothes back on!

01:30:33.083 --> 01:30:35.000
Stop being gross!

01:30:35.667 --> 01:30:37.667
Don't fucking eat it!

01:30:41.458 --> 01:30:42.375
Not working?

01:30:43.292 --> 01:30:45.750
Restaurant closed by health order,
so night off.

01:30:45.833 --> 01:30:46.667
Shame.

01:30:47.167 --> 01:30:48.083
You?

01:30:48.167 --> 01:30:49.292
Got fired by all my clients.

01:30:49.375 --> 01:30:50.333
Sweet.

01:30:50.833 --> 01:30:51.875
That looks great.

01:30:51.958 --> 01:30:55.208
Stinging nettle risotto just like the one
we had in that little place in Italy.

01:30:55.292 --> 01:30:56.167
Here.

01:31:00.333 --> 01:31:01.708
-Stunning.
-That?

01:31:01.792 --> 01:31:04.250
Black forest from Dennings. Yes, you may.

01:31:14.167 --> 01:31:17.667
Let me design you an amazing house
many, many thousands of miles from here,

01:31:17.750 --> 01:31:20.083
and then you give me the deed
for this house.

01:31:20.167 --> 01:31:23.250
We can even have nostalgic
one time good-bye sex.

01:31:23.708 --> 01:31:26.583
Then admit we had a good run
and then went into a ditch,

01:31:26.667 --> 01:31:29.458
which disfigured us and killed our love.

01:31:29.917 --> 01:31:32.500
But that now, we're going
into a new phase.

01:31:32.917 --> 01:31:34.250
A happier life.

01:31:34.833 --> 01:31:36.083
What's in that? Is this...

01:31:36.167 --> 01:31:38.042
Raspberries? Yes. I laced them in.

01:31:38.625 --> 01:31:40.458
But the taste of cherries masks it well,

01:31:40.542 --> 01:31:43.042
but then again,
you do have a famously brilliant palate.

01:31:45.375 --> 01:31:48.375
Oh, shit. You're allergic, aren't you?

01:31:49.125 --> 01:31:51.792
Don't panic. It's all in hand, my darling.

01:31:51.875 --> 01:31:56.125
Here is the epinephrine
that's the solution to your problem.

01:31:56.208 --> 01:31:58.667
-What are you...
-And here is a fresh new contract,

01:31:59.417 --> 01:32:01.292
signing the house over to me.

01:32:01.375 --> 01:32:03.375
You prick. I can't believe...

01:32:03.458 --> 01:32:05.750
We really do need to be apart.
This is unbearable.

01:32:06.208 --> 01:32:09.000
It's simple.
Sign that. I stab you with this.

01:32:09.083 --> 01:32:10.833
-We move on with our lives.
-Never.

01:32:10.917 --> 01:32:13.000
I really do think it is
the best solution for us.

01:32:13.083 --> 01:32:14.917
If you die, I inherit the house anyway.

01:32:15.000 --> 01:32:18.958
So, either way, it's a elegant
win-win situation for me.

01:32:20.167 --> 01:32:22.625
Ivy. Christ. Just sign the paper.

01:32:24.583 --> 01:32:27.333
Don't be crazy. Just sign it!

01:32:29.125 --> 01:32:30.292
Thank Christ.

01:32:38.750 --> 01:32:39.958
You would've let me die.

01:32:40.042 --> 01:32:42.417
No. I knew you'd sign it.

01:32:42.750 --> 01:32:43.917
And I thank you.

01:32:44.375 --> 01:32:46.250
-Who?
-What?

01:32:46.333 --> 01:32:47.625
Thank who?

01:32:50.708 --> 01:32:51.583
Zendaya?

01:33:01.208 --> 01:33:04.000
You know I was never
gonna let you die, Ivy. I--

01:33:08.458 --> 01:33:11.500
If you're looking for the white flags,
I think they're in the dressing room.

01:33:20.125 --> 01:33:22.583
Starting to think that things
are getting a little out of hand.

01:33:22.667 --> 01:33:24.083
-You think?
-Just an instinct.

01:33:24.167 --> 01:33:25.625
Put the gun away, Ivy.

01:33:25.708 --> 01:33:26.958
You need to leave, Theo.

01:33:27.042 --> 01:33:28.167
Or what? You'll shoot me?

01:33:28.250 --> 01:33:29.375
Well, not if you leave.

01:33:29.458 --> 01:33:30.917
I'm pretty sure
we never loaded it anyway--

01:33:32.167 --> 01:33:34.333
-Pretty sure we did.
-Jesus! Ivy!

01:33:34.417 --> 01:33:36.167
-Leave, Theo!
-What have you become?

01:33:36.250 --> 01:33:37.750
I mean, just look at yourself!

01:33:37.833 --> 01:33:38.750
Don't you think I know?

01:33:38.833 --> 01:33:41.333
Trying to love you
has made me bent and distorted

01:33:41.417 --> 01:33:43.292
because you're a fucking
impossible person!

01:33:43.375 --> 01:33:46.000
Of course, you have a gun
because you are fucking reckless, Ivy!

01:33:46.083 --> 01:33:48.500
That's what's killed us. Your selfishness.

01:33:48.583 --> 01:33:50.583
Endless late night drinking
with the waiters.

01:33:50.667 --> 01:33:52.833
Fucking millions of choices
that weren't us!

01:33:54.167 --> 01:33:56.958
I should've been here
watching you masturbate over French tiles

01:33:57.042 --> 01:33:58.333
while burnishing your self image

01:33:58.417 --> 01:34:00.792
by rebuilding our children
and this fucking house!

01:34:02.250 --> 01:34:04.208
You abandoned me. I had to have something!

01:34:04.292 --> 01:34:06.458
You never looked at me, Theo.

01:34:06.542 --> 01:34:08.958
Some nights I'd wait an hour,
maybe two, thinking,

01:34:09.042 --> 01:34:11.417
"Is he gonna look at me?
Does he fucking want to know who I am?"

01:34:11.500 --> 01:34:14.792
I knew who you were.
I just didn't fucking care for it anymore.

01:34:16.542 --> 01:34:18.708
I didn't even do that one,
but it felt like appropriate timing.

01:34:19.625 --> 01:34:20.458
Shit!

01:34:20.542 --> 01:34:22.833
Remember, this is a hair trigger.
It's very dangerous!

01:34:22.917 --> 01:34:24.542
I'd leave if I was you, Theo.

01:34:25.958 --> 01:34:28.125
Fuck! You're just making me madder!

01:34:28.458 --> 01:34:30.250
Ivy. We both have said things
we didn't mean.

01:34:30.333 --> 01:34:32.375
-I meant them!
-I meant them too!

01:34:33.333 --> 01:34:35.042
Oh, my God! You don't care if I'm dead!

01:34:35.125 --> 01:34:37.083
You've got a fucking gun, Ivy!

01:34:37.167 --> 01:34:39.042
I've got fruit and utensils.

01:34:39.125 --> 01:34:40.500
Yeah, thanks for reminding me!

01:34:40.958 --> 01:34:43.542
Julia Child's fucking ugly stove!

01:34:43.625 --> 01:34:46.125
Not the stove! Not that! No! Not that!

01:34:46.208 --> 01:34:47.083
Drop the gun!

01:34:48.375 --> 01:34:50.500
Okay! Will you fucking--

01:34:51.625 --> 01:34:52.833
Hal, lights off.

01:34:58.667 --> 01:34:59.792
Hal, lights up.

01:35:13.333 --> 01:35:15.750
I hit it! I hit it! I aimed and I hit it!

01:35:15.833 --> 01:35:17.750
Ivy. You're being ridiculous.

01:35:17.833 --> 01:35:20.125
Just give me the house.
You get the business.

01:35:20.208 --> 01:35:21.750
We both get something we love.

01:35:21.833 --> 01:35:23.833
I should be the something you love.

01:35:23.917 --> 01:35:24.917
You were.

01:35:25.458 --> 01:35:27.625
You were fucking everything to me.

01:35:27.708 --> 01:35:29.417
You stopped. You're not supposed to stop.

01:35:29.500 --> 01:35:30.917
-You stopped.
-You stopped first!

01:35:31.000 --> 01:35:32.625
-I never stopped!
-Liar!

01:35:33.042 --> 01:35:33.958
Slow down!

01:35:34.625 --> 01:35:36.167
-Hal, lock door.
-Hal, unlock door.

01:35:36.250 --> 01:35:38.250
-Hal, lock door.
-Unlock door!

01:35:40.083 --> 01:35:41.083
Hal, lock door.

01:35:48.208 --> 01:35:50.875
Did you mean what you just said,
that you never stopped?

01:35:51.250 --> 01:35:53.667
Or just the fact I was chasing you
with a gun, right?

01:35:53.750 --> 01:35:56.333
No. No, I meant it.

01:35:58.042 --> 01:35:59.750
Why leave me then?

01:36:00.500 --> 01:36:03.125
Because you hated me
and I couldn't bear it.

01:36:03.208 --> 01:36:04.583
I didn't.

01:36:05.333 --> 01:36:08.375
You didn't seem to be in enough pain
for what had happened to us.

01:36:09.000 --> 01:36:09.875
I was.

01:36:10.917 --> 01:36:11.833
I am.

01:36:12.542 --> 01:36:13.375
It's just...

01:36:14.875 --> 01:36:17.542
It's just hard to show it, you know?

01:36:17.917 --> 01:36:19.167
Difficult to see it.

01:36:20.708 --> 01:36:22.583
Hal, unlock door.

01:36:33.375 --> 01:36:36.083
Truth is, I doubt
I could live without you anyway.

01:36:37.958 --> 01:36:38.917
And I, you.

01:36:40.167 --> 01:36:42.292
So, murder suicide pact then?

01:36:47.292 --> 01:36:49.250
We're so good at words.

01:36:49.333 --> 01:36:51.583
And yet we could never find
the ones we needed.

01:36:53.833 --> 01:36:55.458
I was careless with you.

01:36:56.250 --> 01:37:00.625
You were hurt and I was so lost
in my own pain that I couldn't get to you.

01:37:00.708 --> 01:37:02.542
I was cruel.

01:37:03.000 --> 01:37:05.458
I thought we were impregnable,
and you were my person in the world.

01:37:05.542 --> 01:37:06.917
I'm so sorry.

01:37:12.875 --> 01:37:13.917
Oh, jeez.

01:37:14.000 --> 01:37:15.500
Jesus indeed.

01:37:18.208 --> 01:37:19.750
I mean, we nearly...

01:37:21.250 --> 01:37:22.417
I know.

01:37:27.292 --> 01:37:28.875
Fucking hell!

01:37:30.625 --> 01:37:32.500
If you didn't throw like a winded toddler.

01:37:32.583 --> 01:37:35.292
Or you shoot like a confused mole.

01:37:36.542 --> 01:37:38.625
Brave of you still to appear
like that though.

01:37:38.708 --> 01:37:42.792
I wanted to try one last time.

01:37:45.083 --> 01:37:47.958
It's terrifying how close we came
to losing each other.

01:37:57.958 --> 01:37:59.208
What a day.

01:38:00.167 --> 01:38:01.292
What a day.

01:38:01.833 --> 01:38:03.167
Lucky us.

01:38:03.250 --> 01:38:04.333
Lucky us.

01:38:05.542 --> 01:38:06.750
Always have been.

01:38:08.375 --> 01:38:09.792
Remember when we met?

01:38:11.375 --> 01:38:12.375
Good day.

01:38:22.792 --> 01:38:24.042
Death do us part.

01:38:26.333 --> 01:38:27.708
Death do us part.

01:38:38.000 --> 01:38:41.458
Hal... play our song and light the fire.
