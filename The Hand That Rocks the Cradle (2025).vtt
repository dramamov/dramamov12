[Caitlin] I'm sorry. Okay. Keep going.

02:07.125 --> 02:08.917
Well, then things got really bad.

02:09.833 --> 02:12.708
The family that I was nannying for,
they had to move.

02:12.792 --> 02:14.917
[Caitlin] And that's what you do?
You're in child care?

02:15.000 --> 02:17.667
Yeah. Well, that's what I love.

02:17.750 --> 02:21.625
Um, I was going to school for it.
Uh, early education.

02:21.708 --> 02:23.833
But then, you know, losing this job,

02:23.917 --> 02:25.583
uh, it's just really hard financially.

02:25.667 --> 02:27.125
Yeah, for sure.

02:27.208 --> 02:29.292
But then I get this email
from my landlord saying,

02:29.375 --> 02:31.208
"We're raising your rent. Good day."

02:31.292 --> 02:32.583
I'm glad you came today.

02:33.542 --> 02:37.083
You know, cases like yours are
exactly why my firm does these events.

02:41.125 --> 02:44.708
So, this is what you do?
Pick fights with landlords?

02:44.792 --> 02:48.708
My firm handles all kinds of housing
and real estate issues.

02:50.042 --> 02:52.625
Keeping landlords honest, we do that...

02:52.708 --> 02:53.917
We do that pro bono.

02:55.958 --> 02:57.958
-It's like a perk.
-[cell phone buzzing]

02:59.167 --> 03:00.417
Um...

03:07.042 --> 03:08.458
So, what are you doing here?

03:09.542 --> 03:11.042
[chuckles]
What do you mean?

03:11.875 --> 03:13.083
You're about to pop.

03:13.750 --> 03:17.500
Shouldn't you be home
drinking raspberry tea?

03:18.333 --> 03:22.500
Well, that sounds very nice,
but, um, I'm managing.

03:23.750 --> 03:24.750
People do it.

03:43.333 --> 03:47.875

Um, where's the contract? I need it.

04:01.417 --> 04:03.042
He says he's still proofreading.

04:03.625 --> 04:04.833
I can call him again.

04:06.375 --> 04:07.500
Uh...

04:08.250 --> 04:10.750
I-I think we're gonna
have to pick this up later.

04:10.833 --> 04:13.125
- [breathes deeply]
-Oh. Is everything okay?

04:13.208 --> 04:15.458
Uh, yeah. Um...

04:15.542 --> 04:17.208
Yeah, I just think I'm going into labor.

04:17.292 --> 04:18.500
-Oh.
-[breathes deeply]

04:27.917 --> 04:30.042
Just tell me. How are they not real?

04:30.125 --> 04:32.542
-Where are my keys?
-Mom?

04:32.625 --> 04:35.125
-Earth to Mom.
-Can you hold this a second?

04:36.042 --> 04:37.042
Mom.

04:37.125 --> 04:38.875
-What, the baby animals?
-Yeah.

04:38.958 --> 04:41.083
-Because they're in a video game.
-It costs money.

04:41.167 --> 04:42.875
Why would they cost money
if they're not real?

04:42.958 --> 04:44.542
Yeah, that's exactly my question.

04:50.167 --> 04:52.750
-[gate creaks]
-Let's make some space.

04:52.833 --> 04:54.208
Mom, this is serious to me.

04:54.292 --> 04:55.667
I know, honey. I know.

04:55.750 --> 04:57.750
I know.
You're saying it's serious to you.

04:57.833 --> 04:59.250
And I get it. But we need to go.

04:59.333 --> 05:01.833
-Can you get in the car?
-I'm helping.

05:01.917 --> 05:04.917
[grunts] Okay. There we go.

05:10.708 --> 05:13.208

-[woman] What are you doing?

05:13.292 --> 05:14.792
You leave your baby
in the street?

05:14.875 --> 05:17.250
[Caitlin] You can't just
drive down here that fast.

05:17.333 --> 05:19.542
[woman] Oh, you're lucky that stroller
didn't damage my car.

05:19.625 --> 05:21.292
-[Caitlin] Come on.
-[woman] Dumb bitch.

05:21.375 --> 05:23.125

05:24.417 --> 05:26.667
-Oh, come on.

-Are we ready to do this?
-[Emma] Dad.

05:29.833 --> 05:31.667
-[Caitlin] Jesus.
-[Miguel] What the hell?

05:32.500 --> 05:34.292
-What happened?
-[Caitlin] This woman...

05:34.375 --> 05:36.833
She just came speeding down here.

05:36.917 --> 05:38.875
-What a fucking idiot.
-[Emma] Dad.

05:38.958 --> 05:42.333
What? If it's true, you can say "fuck."

05:42.458 --> 05:43.917
[Josie fussing]

05:44.000 --> 05:45.583
There should be a stop sign there.

05:45.667 --> 05:48.500
-Yeah, well, LA.
-[Caitlin] What does that mean?

05:49.042 --> 05:50.958
-People don't stop in LA.
-Oh...

05:54.167 --> 05:55.792
No, there should be a stop sign.

05:59.000 --> 06:00.000
Thank you.

06:01.250 --> 06:03.167
Okay. Tomatoes...

06:07.250 --> 06:08.875
Okay, we're not buying those today.

06:09.458 --> 06:11.792
Let's check out the apples over there.

06:13.042 --> 06:14.208
Hmm.

06:22.375 --> 06:23.417
Caitlin.

06:27.833 --> 06:30.042
-Polly. Yeah.
-Polly. Right.

06:30.125 --> 06:31.500
Wow. How are you?

06:32.042 --> 06:33.667
I'm good. Yeah, I'm good.

06:34.333 --> 06:36.083
What happened with your landlord?

06:36.167 --> 06:38.083
Um, I sent him a letter,

06:38.167 --> 06:40.667
but he said something about, you know,
the law with rent increase,

06:40.750 --> 06:42.333
that unfortunately it doesn't apply.

06:42.417 --> 06:44.125
Well, he's wrong.

06:44.208 --> 06:46.292
-What you need to do is--
-It's fine.

06:46.375 --> 06:48.333
You know, I'm-I'm getting by.

06:49.250 --> 06:50.250
[Miguel] Got pesto.

06:51.875 --> 06:55.083
Um, yeah, it has palm oil.

06:56.125 --> 06:57.125
Is that bad?

06:57.750 --> 07:01.292
-Well, it's 50% saturated fat, so...
-[chuckles]

07:01.375 --> 07:03.292
[Miguel] I thought fat was
a good thing now.

07:03.375 --> 07:06.083
It... There's different kinds.
Can you take it back?

07:06.167 --> 07:08.250
Sure. I just thought, for pasta, it'd...

07:08.333 --> 07:10.167
-[Josie fussing]
-[Emma] Mom.

07:10.250 --> 07:13.250
-So, what's your plan, then, as far as...
-Mom? Mom.

07:13.333 --> 07:15.000
I'm speaking, Emma, okay?

07:15.083 --> 07:17.250
-[Emma] Can we go now?
-We just got here.

07:17.333 --> 07:20.375
-I'm hungry. Mom.
-We're gonna get food, okay?

07:20.458 --> 07:21.583
Um...

07:22.500 --> 07:27.250
If you ever needed a babysitter,
even just for an afternoon

07:27.333 --> 07:31.167
to really, you know,
nail the farmers' market...

07:31.250 --> 07:34.583
-And you're in childcare?
-I am. Um...

07:34.667 --> 07:38.042
I had mentioned it, you know,
but that was a long time ago. [laughs]

07:38.125 --> 07:39.375
I remember, yeah.

07:40.917 --> 07:42.750
Let me see if I have your number.

07:42.833 --> 07:43.833
Okay.

07:44.750 --> 07:46.792
[Caitlin] I mean,
she's had a rough go of it.

07:48.208 --> 07:53.958
It's just easier to talk to her than,
like, half the moms at Emma's school.

07:54.042 --> 07:56.542
She's just like an actual person.

07:57.750 --> 08:00.500
But she has experience with kids?

08:00.583 --> 08:02.792
Yeah. Yeah, I'll get a reference from her.

08:03.750 --> 08:07.083
-Mom, not too short.
-[Caitlin] I know. There you go.

08:07.167 --> 08:09.125
-And you said you wanted a break.
-[Caitlin] I do.

08:09.208 --> 08:13.667
I could... I could go a bit easier
this time, and, um...

08:14.250 --> 08:16.667
take care of myself,
like everybody's always demanding.

08:20.375 --> 08:21.542
Okay.

08:24.208 --> 08:25.208
Okay.

08:30.417 --> 08:31.417
Right.

08:32.917 --> 08:34.583
What do you think?

08:36.750 --> 08:38.750
-[Emma] Perfect.
-[exclaims softly]

08:52.333 --> 08:54.625
- [Rosanna] Hello.
-Hi, Rosanna?

08:55.333 --> 08:58.000
-Uh, yes.
-Hi. My name's Caitlin.

08:58.083 --> 09:01.042
I... I got your number from Polly Murphy.

09:01.125 --> 09:04.083
-Oh. Hi.
-Hi. Yeah.

09:04.167 --> 09:06.208
We're considering hiring her as a nanny

09:06.292 --> 09:09.708
and I was just curious
about your experience with her.

09:09.792 --> 09:11.250
Oh, um...

09:12.042 --> 09:14.292
[stutters] She's amazing.

09:14.375 --> 09:16.208
Really became a part of our family.

09:16.292 --> 09:18.083
-That's great to hear.
-[Josie crying]

09:18.167 --> 09:20.792
Sorry. [stutters] How long
did she work for you?

09:22.542 --> 09:26.125
-Gosh, a couple of years.
-Uh-huh.

09:26.208 --> 09:28.125
Okay. Wow. That's great.

09:28.208 --> 09:30.625
That's a... That's a really long time.
[shushes]

09:30.708 --> 09:35.250
-Yeah. Really wonderful with the kids.
- [Josie fussing]

09:46.292 --> 09:47.292
Hi.

09:50.333 --> 09:53.458
So, clean go here, and then
dirties straight in the dishwasher.

09:53.542 --> 09:55.667
-There's a sterilized cycle.
-Okay.

09:56.208 --> 09:57.500
And just glass bottles.

09:58.125 --> 10:00.000
Right. Hold on the microplastics.

10:00.875 --> 10:05.958
Exactly. Yes, I know we're a lost cause,
but, you know, hopefully for them.

10:08.167 --> 10:10.000
Uh, okay. Here.

10:10.083 --> 10:13.208
-Oh, wow.
-Yeah, I've stocked up quite a lot.

10:13.292 --> 10:15.667
So we've got left to right,
older to newer.

10:15.750 --> 10:18.667
-So you can just pull from the left.
-And no formula?

10:18.750 --> 10:21.375
For... Oh. No, that stuff is just sugar.

10:21.458 --> 10:23.667
So once she has that... you know.

10:23.750 --> 10:25.542
-Got it. Yeah.
-Okay.

10:26.125 --> 10:27.208
Josie.

10:28.000 --> 10:29.708
Josie, it's your new nanny, Polly.

-Hi.

Great. Yeah.

Um...

14:46.458 --> 14:47.875
I think I could tell that.

14:51.292 --> 14:52.542
Really?

14:52.625 --> 14:53.708
About me?

14:54.583 --> 14:57.333
Yeah. You have that vibe to you.

15:03.333 --> 15:05.833
-I think this is going back.
-I like it.

15:08.333 --> 15:09.417
Do you want it?

15:10.083 --> 15:12.292
I mean, maybe it looks better on you.

15:15.250 --> 15:16.333
Okay.

15:19.333 --> 15:20.333
Let's see.

15:21.083 --> 15:22.292
Oh, yeah.

15:26.333 --> 15:28.042
I'm sorry. Is that weird? I...

15:28.125 --> 15:31.000
No. No, I... I love it.

15:38.833 --> 15:40.750
You know what?
Um, I'll grab you some scissors.

15:40.833 --> 15:41.875
Cut the tag.

16:35.042 --> 16:36.333
Miguel, um,

16:37.292 --> 16:39.125
can we try tonight?

16:39.833 --> 16:41.833
Maybe? I'm just not... I'm not...

16:42.708 --> 16:44.250
[Miguel groans]

16:44.333 --> 16:46.458
-Right now.
-Okay.

16:48.958 --> 16:50.708
[sighs softly]

16:50.792 --> 16:54.125
I'm sorry. I've missed you, too, you know?

16:55.667 --> 16:57.875
I've missed you, too.
It's just Josie, and...

16:58.625 --> 16:59.750
It's fine.

17:00.250 --> 17:01.333
It's okay.

17:14.250 --> 17:18.333
Oh, you know what, I have that, um...
stop sign meeting this afternoon.

17:19.042 --> 17:20.125
[Miguel] Mm-hmm.

17:21.208 --> 17:23.333
Could you take Emma to basketball?

17:24.083 --> 17:26.167
I can't. I'm meeting with the builders.

17:27.583 --> 17:28.583
Okay.

17:29.958 --> 17:31.875
Why don't you ask Polly to take her?

17:31.958 --> 17:33.083
It's walking distance.

17:34.000 --> 17:35.042
Oh, yeah.

17:35.708 --> 17:36.708
Okay.

17:43.458 --> 17:45.000
I have a surprise for you.

17:50.208 --> 17:51.250
[gasps]

17:53.208 --> 17:55.458
-[Polly] Don't tell.
-I won't.

17:59.875 --> 18:02.875
Do you want some, Josie? I bet you do.

18:04.333 --> 18:06.333
Here. [gasps] Mm.

18:09.625 --> 18:10.750
Give her some.

18:12.750 --> 18:14.083
It's so much sugar.

18:14.208 --> 18:15.542
It's good for you.

18:24.167 --> 18:26.458
Mm. [laughs]

18:27.667 --> 18:29.167
Did your mom let you eat sugar?

18:29.250 --> 18:30.333
She did.

18:31.875 --> 18:33.250
She made the best cupcakes.

18:36.583 --> 18:39.042
But before I got too old,
she had to go away.

18:40.500 --> 18:42.042
But your dad could stay?

18:43.333 --> 18:44.417
Nope.

18:47.417 --> 18:48.667
The place I went to live,

18:49.417 --> 18:51.792
the only thing they had to eat
was tuna fish.

18:51.875 --> 18:54.375
-[chuckles] That's silly.
-It is.

18:55.542 --> 18:57.333
But it gets even sillier than that.

18:58.792 --> 19:01.583
There was no mayonnaise, no lettuce,

19:02.625 --> 19:03.750
no bread even.

19:06.000 --> 19:08.917
I had to eat the tuna
out of a can, like a cat.

19:10.750 --> 19:12.375
And when there was no more left...

19:18.250 --> 19:19.833
there was nothing left to eat.

19:22.500 --> 19:23.625
[Emma chuckles]

19:42.375 --> 19:43.750
Oh, my goodness.

[automated voice] Emergency.
There's smoke in the kitchen.

20:30.208 --> 20:32.750
-Smoke alarm detected in the kitchen.
-Okay.

20:32.833 --> 20:34.542
[indistinct chatter on video]

20:36.667 --> 20:37.667
What are you making?

20:38.333 --> 20:39.833
Uh, cioppino.

20:40.708 --> 20:42.208
It's like a fish stew.

20:43.417 --> 20:44.458
Huh.

20:46.000 --> 20:47.083
Hey, I can cook.

20:47.875 --> 20:50.083
Okay? I'm cooking. I can cook.

20:51.125 --> 20:53.042
It's just Stewart coming, right?

20:53.125 --> 20:55.875
Uh, I think he's bringing Bethany.

20:57.000 --> 21:00.083
I mean, we could just get In-N-Out
and tacos or something.

21:00.167 --> 21:04.583
You can't invite people over to dinner
and then just get In-N-Out.

21:04.667 --> 21:06.625
-Come on.
-Oh, I think this is burning.

21:06.708 --> 21:08.958
-Okay. Shit.
-[Miguel] Oh, boy.

21:09.042 --> 21:11.750
Out of my kitchen. Out.
Everybody out of my kitchen.

21:11.833 --> 21:13.125
Okay, chapino.

21:13.208 --> 21:16.208
-Cioppino. We're getting banished.
-[Polly laughs]

21:22.000 --> 21:25.167
[Stewart] But that's assuming
that a police presence reduces crime.

21:25.250 --> 21:28.292
Or that it helps at all
at resolving disputes.

21:28.375 --> 21:31.833
I mean, there are studies
that show the opposite.

21:31.917 --> 21:33.167
-What studies?
-What?

21:33.250 --> 21:34.333
What studies?

21:35.000 --> 21:36.125
There are multiple.

21:36.208 --> 21:37.542
I can't cite one.

21:37.625 --> 21:39.667
Okay, so say somebody
broke into your house,

21:39.750 --> 21:40.833
you would, what?

21:41.708 --> 21:45.042
Honestly, I mean, I would grab my bat

21:45.125 --> 21:47.417
before I would call the police
or do anything.

21:47.500 --> 21:48.917
-Stewart.
-[Stewart] I'm serious.

21:49.000 --> 21:53.333
Obviously, the first priority
would be my partner and I's safety.

21:53.417 --> 21:56.417
But take the cash, take the TV.
The stuff isn't...

21:56.500 --> 21:59.708
But, Stewart, what if they wanted
your Ted Williams rookie card?

21:59.792 --> 22:00.917
What would you do?

22:01.000 --> 22:04.458
Well, then I would know
that the person under the ski mask is you.

22:05.333 --> 22:06.708
You bitch. [clears throat]

22:06.792 --> 22:09.125
Apologies, to everyone at the table.

22:10.625 --> 22:13.500
Polly, I hear you guys met
at one of our tenants' rights events.

22:16.083 --> 22:17.167
-Yeah.
-[Stewart] Mm.

22:19.292 --> 22:20.458
Um...

22:21.250 --> 22:22.625
Where is your place?

22:22.708 --> 22:24.292
Oh, I live in Boyle Heights.

22:25.208 --> 22:28.458
Oh, nice. Uh, why way out there?

22:30.542 --> 22:32.125
Well, that's what I can afford.

22:32.208 --> 22:33.667
Oh, I get you.

22:35.417 --> 22:38.333
-[Polly] Where do you live?
-Oh, Silver Lake.

22:39.708 --> 22:40.833
Mm.

22:40.917 --> 22:41.917
I get ya.

22:43.333 --> 22:45.417
Anyways, I'm actually
thinking about moving.

how long I can stay here for.

Can I be done?

23:00.083 --> 23:02.958
Well, you're not watching TV,
if that's what you're after.

23:03.042 --> 23:04.750
-I can go hang with her.
-Yeah.

23:05.792 --> 23:07.917
Yeah. Okay, great. Thank you.

23:10.542 --> 23:12.083

Oh, my God.
Look at this little angel eating soup.

23:17.333 --> 23:18.792
[Caitlin] Yeah. It's really interesting.

23:18.875 --> 23:21.542
The sooner you start them
on real food, the better.

23:21.625 --> 23:23.708
You know, because baby food
can be such a crutch.

23:23.792 --> 23:27.542
Ugh, tell me about it. I've been trying
to wean myself off baby food for a while.

23:28.083 --> 23:29.167

25:11.083 --> 25:12.292
Yeah, you don't know me.

25:15.583 --> 25:16.667
Yes, I do.

25:19.958 --> 25:21.625
You think if you try hard enough,

you can stop bad things from happening.

there was a smell, which there was,

35:51.375 --> 35:52.417
So...

35:53.083 --> 35:56.542
I'm just confused because we had talked
about not feeding her sugar at all.

51:32.250 --> 51:33.333
[Miguel] You okay?

51:34.958 --> 51:35.958
Yeah.

51:37.125 --> 51:38.125
It's nice.

51:48.750 --> 51:50.208
[water running]

52:00.417 --> 52:02.000
Do you want some help cleaning up?

52:02.875 --> 52:03.875
Sure.

52:11.958 --> 52:12.958
You're, um...

52:14.375 --> 52:16.042
You're wearing the dress I gave you.

52:17.208 --> 52:18.208
Yeah.

52:22.042 --> 52:23.125
Looks nice.

52:24.292 --> 52:25.833
Oh, thanks.

52:30.417 --> 52:31.917
[water running]

52:37.125 --> 52:38.875
[whizzing]

52:38.958 --> 52:41.875
-[Emma] Mom! Mom!
-[fireworks cackling]

52:41.958 --> 52:44.125
-Mom! Fireworks!
-Get down! Get down!

52:49.167 --> 52:50.500
What happened? What happened?

52:51.167 --> 52:53.375
Where did you get that from? Answer me!

52:53.458 --> 52:54.875
-I don't know.
-[Miguel] Caitlin, don't.

52:54.958 --> 52:57.542
Do you have any idea
what could have happened?

52:57.625 --> 52:59.625
Stop it! Look at her. She's terrified.

52:59.708 --> 53:01.250
-Polly!
-It's okay. It's okay.

53:01.333 --> 53:03.042
I'm sorry. I got them at the park.

53:03.125 --> 53:04.750
Why would you do that?

53:04.833 --> 53:06.750
I thought it'd be fun.
I didn't think she...

53:06.833 --> 53:08.417
-Fun?
-It was an accident, okay?

53:08.500 --> 53:10.083
-What's the matter with you?
-What?

53:10.167 --> 53:12.458
She did it on purpose.
Why can't you see that?

53:12.542 --> 53:14.875
-Why would she do that?
-She knew what would happen.

53:14.958 --> 53:16.958
-She wanted this to happen.
-[Polly] I just think...

53:17.042 --> 53:18.708
You know, maybe I should go.

53:18.792 --> 53:20.333
Yeah? Yeah. Leave!

53:20.417 --> 53:21.833
Let's take a break and we can all--

53:21.917 --> 53:23.333
No, no. Leave!

53:23.417 --> 53:24.417
Leave this house!

53:24.500 --> 53:26.125
Mom, it was my fault.

53:27.792 --> 53:30.792
I mean, if that's what you want.

53:30.875 --> 53:32.917
-Wait. Let's just please...
-No, no.

53:33.000 --> 53:35.208
Do you need me to do this myself?
Because I will.

53:35.292 --> 53:37.667
-Where is she gonna go?
-I don't care!

53:37.750 --> 53:38.750
Not here!

53:40.500 --> 53:42.500
What are you doing? Go! Pack!

53:45.000 --> 53:47.583
-Okay. It's okay. All right? I'm sorry.
-No, Polly.

53:47.667 --> 53:48.667
I'm sorry.

53:51.250 --> 53:53.625
-[Emma] Polly...
-[Caitlin breathing heavily]

54:05.000 --> 54:06.583
[exhales deeply]

54:09.417 --> 54:10.417
Miguel.

54:18.708 --> 54:19.708
What?

54:20.917 --> 54:21.917
Do you believe me?

54:23.208 --> 54:24.708
[in Spanish] Por Dios, no puede ser.

54:24.792 --> 54:25.917
[in English] Do you?

54:27.458 --> 54:29.833
[sighs] Believe you about what?

54:29.917 --> 54:32.625
[stutters] That she did it on purpose,

54:32.708 --> 54:34.708
that she knew what would happen.

54:34.792 --> 54:36.583
No, that's...

54:36.667 --> 54:39.417
What? You think she just gave her
fucking fireworks and it's fine?

54:39.500 --> 54:40.917
I think it was a mistake.

54:42.375 --> 54:43.417
Okay?

54:44.125 --> 54:46.458
-She just wanted to have fun.
-Ugh.

54:46.542 --> 54:48.208
Yeah, of course you'd think that.

54:49.250 --> 54:50.250
What?

54:51.542 --> 54:52.583
Why?

54:52.667 --> 54:54.042
Because I'm Mexican?

54:54.625 --> 54:56.500
I can't help myself?
I fucking love fireworks?

54:56.583 --> 54:57.583
No.

54:57.667 --> 55:00.000
No. Because no matter what I say,
you won't listen to me

55:00.083 --> 55:02.958
because you think I'm a fucking nutcase
that you need to handle.

55:03.042 --> 55:04.208
No, no, no.

55:06.000 --> 55:07.292
[sighs]

55:10.875 --> 55:11.958
You're...

55:15.500 --> 55:18.667
You're struggling again.

55:25.292 --> 55:26.750
It's not your fault.

55:28.208 --> 55:29.833
But I can't help you

55:29.917 --> 55:33.333
if you're not willing to see
the possibility that you could be wrong.

55:34.417 --> 55:36.000
Can you see that possibility?

55:42.875 --> 55:43.875
I don't know.

55:47.708 --> 55:48.958
I need you to try.

55:54.500 --> 55:55.583
Or what?

56:00.875 --> 56:01.875
Miguel.

56:04.000 --> 56:05.000
Or what?

56:09.208 --> 56:10.208
Okay.

56:10.792 --> 56:11.792
[sniffles]

56:14.000 --> 56:16.167
Do you... [sniffles]

56:18.542 --> 56:19.917
Do you know where she went?

56:22.583 --> 56:24.917
Happy fucking new year to you!

56:26.333 --> 56:28.125
Why do you do this to me?

56:30.583 --> 56:32.167
[static buzzing]

56:32.958 --> 56:35.833
[woman continues shouting]

56:43.000 --> 56:45.417
[grunts]

57:25.875 --> 57:27.917
[man 1] Hey, come on, man.

57:34.583 --> 57:36.708
[man 2] Hey, man. I'm fucking serious.

57:36.792 --> 57:38.000
[man 3] Hey, hey!

57:41.875 --> 57:43.417
[people chattering]

58:00.875 --> 58:02.083
[woman] Shut up!

58:36.708 --> 58:37.708
I'm sorry.

58:40.583 --> 58:41.583
I, um...

58:43.958 --> 58:46.458
I've had some issues in the past, and I...

58:47.708 --> 58:49.750
I thought
that I had dealt with them, but...

58:54.250 --> 58:55.250
I understand.

58:58.500 --> 59:01.000
But I have a handle on that now, so...

59:16.875 --> 59:18.542
[Stewart] Caitlin, you're not crazy.

59:19.708 --> 59:22.167
You know what we need?
More data.

59:26.292 --> 59:28.417
It's getting better. I, um...

59:28.500 --> 59:29.917
I just need to keep focusing--

59:30.000 --> 59:33.625
What do you know about her?
I mean, besides what she's told you?

59:34.417 --> 59:35.583
I mean, you can...

59:36.458 --> 59:38.583
You can think something,
but that doesn't...

59:39.292 --> 59:40.625
That doesn't make it real.

59:41.208 --> 59:42.917
Look, what are we gonna find out?

59:43.000 --> 59:45.083
Probably that everything's normal.

59:45.167 --> 59:47.458
So why not just take a look. All right?

01:00:05.708 --> 01:00:07.042
You're my favorite psycho.

01:00:12.417 --> 01:00:14.208
[drilling]

01:00:17.167 --> 01:00:18.667
[Josie babbles]

01:00:50.375 --> 01:00:51.375
Hi.

01:00:53.167 --> 01:00:54.167
Hi.

01:00:55.208 --> 01:00:57.458
They finally finished
the renovations in here.

01:00:58.125 --> 01:00:59.333
They did a good job.

01:01:02.208 --> 01:01:03.417
Glad you approve.

01:01:05.625 --> 01:01:08.292
-Sorry. I'll get out of your hair.
-Listen.

01:01:10.333 --> 01:01:12.167
I know this is their house, and,

01:01:12.917 --> 01:01:15.458
well, you're their friend, but...

01:01:16.042 --> 01:01:17.625
Well, this feels like...

01:01:18.792 --> 01:01:20.542
my space, so...

01:01:23.625 --> 01:01:25.583
And you don't want people
just coming in and out.

01:01:30.667 --> 01:01:31.750
Have a good day.

01:03:17.500 --> 01:03:19.750
[breathes deeply]

01:03:27.417 --> 01:03:29.458
[male voice over phone]
You have reached the voice mailbox

01:03:29.542 --> 01:03:33.375
for 515-177-3...

01:03:37.000 --> 01:03:38.250
Oh.

01:03:38.333 --> 01:03:40.375
-Here you are.
-Hi.

01:03:40.458 --> 01:03:43.833
Uh, is there more breast milk?
I looked in the freezer, there's nothing.

01:03:44.917 --> 01:03:46.125
Oh, uh...

01:03:46.875 --> 01:03:48.625
What are you doing in here anyway?

01:03:49.750 --> 01:03:52.083
Nothing. I just need to finish something.

01:03:52.875 --> 01:03:54.667
[chuckles] Okay.

01:03:55.208 --> 01:03:56.542
Should I give her formula?

01:03:57.208 --> 01:03:59.250
Don't give her-- No, can... Um...

01:03:59.333 --> 01:04:02.208
Can you just take her for five minutes
and I'll be right in?

01:04:03.292 --> 01:04:04.292
Sure.

01:04:05.292 --> 01:04:06.292
[Josie fusses]

01:04:15.958 --> 01:04:17.625
[keyboard clacking]

01:04:26.375 --> 01:04:27.833
[siren chirps]

01:04:35.917 --> 01:04:37.292
[line ringing]

01:04:56.417 --> 01:04:58.583
-[woman] Oh, my God.
-Found a week later.

01:04:58.667 --> 01:04:59.667
Rosanna?

01:05:00.333 --> 01:05:03.083
-Yes.
-Hi, um, I'm Caitlin.

01:05:03.167 --> 01:05:05.458
I called you a while back about Polly.

01:05:05.542 --> 01:05:06.750
She nannied for you.

01:05:06.833 --> 01:05:07.958
I know who you are.

01:05:08.542 --> 01:05:10.125
Can I talk to you for a second?

01:05:11.000 --> 01:05:12.000
Sure.

01:05:13.750 --> 01:05:16.250
-Is Polly okay?
-Yeah, she's fine.

01:05:16.917 --> 01:05:20.958
She's been involved in some dangerous
incidents with my children, so...

01:05:23.125 --> 01:05:26.792
Listen, Polly hasn't returned
my calls for a while.

01:05:27.667 --> 01:05:30.958
If she's using again,
her behavior probably is erratic.

01:05:31.042 --> 01:05:34.167
So, she met you here then, is that right?

01:05:34.250 --> 01:05:36.542
And she told you what?
She told you she's an addict?

01:05:38.042 --> 01:05:39.042
Yes.

01:05:39.542 --> 01:05:42.292
And I made a promise to help her
however I could.

01:05:44.667 --> 01:05:46.292
Did she ever even work for you?

01:05:47.208 --> 01:05:49.667
-Did she take care of your kids?
-Sh...

01:05:50.875 --> 01:05:52.667
Yes, she did.

01:05:56.042 --> 01:05:57.125
You're lying.

01:05:58.083 --> 01:06:02.000
You know, if you had any idea
what Polly's been through...

01:06:02.083 --> 01:06:03.083
Really? Like what?

01:06:03.167 --> 01:06:05.333
Like when I met her,
she was living in her car,

01:06:05.417 --> 01:06:08.750
and had a boyfriend who beat her up
so bad she had to go to the hospital.

01:06:08.833 --> 01:06:10.500
Okay. And you just believed her,
is that right?

01:06:10.583 --> 01:06:13.250
What? Listen, I have a meeting here.

01:06:13.333 --> 01:06:15.875
I'm so sorry about your meeting.
You lied to me.

01:06:17.000 --> 01:06:18.417
You put my children in danger!

01:06:18.500 --> 01:06:20.208
-Do you even care about that?
-[Rosanna] I do.

01:06:20.292 --> 01:06:23.208
-And I'm trying--
-What if nothing she told you is true?

01:06:23.292 --> 01:06:24.292
What then?

01:06:25.542 --> 01:06:26.583
What then?

01:06:28.250 --> 01:06:29.542
Are you gonna answer me?

01:06:29.625 --> 01:06:32.000
-[man] Okay. I'm gonna ask you to leave.
-I'm going!

01:06:39.583 --> 01:06:40.750
[huffs]

01:06:42.542 --> 01:06:45.667
[Stewart] Hey, uh, it's Stewart.

01:06:47.125 --> 01:06:49.500
Um, give me a call when you get this.

01:06:50.583 --> 01:06:53.333
I, uh... I think we should talk.

01:06:53.417 --> 01:06:55.167
[printer whirring]

01:07:20.333 --> 01:07:21.333
[Caitlin] Hey.

01:07:22.083 --> 01:07:23.292
I need to talk to you.

01:07:27.042 --> 01:07:28.083
Where'd you go?

01:07:28.167 --> 01:07:30.083
Out. I needed to check on something.

01:07:34.125 --> 01:07:35.917
Okay. What?

01:07:37.958 --> 01:07:40.250
[breathes deeply]

01:07:40.833 --> 01:07:42.292
She's lying to us.

01:07:43.417 --> 01:07:46.542
That reference she gave,
she never even worked for her.

01:07:48.083 --> 01:07:49.167
How do you know?

01:07:50.125 --> 01:07:53.250
Because I chased the woman down
and I spoke to her.

01:07:53.333 --> 01:07:56.167
And what?
She said, "Polly didn't work for me"?

01:07:56.250 --> 01:07:58.583
No. No, of course not.

01:07:58.667 --> 01:08:00.833
I-I cornered her at this AA meeting,

01:08:00.917 --> 01:08:02.958
which is where they met, by the way,

01:08:03.042 --> 01:08:04.875
-and then she lied to me again--
-[shushes]

01:08:07.833 --> 01:08:09.208
That's what you were doing?

01:08:10.000 --> 01:08:11.000
Your baby's hungry.

01:08:11.083 --> 01:08:13.625
-Oh, my God, I'm sorry--
-And she's sleeping.

01:08:15.500 --> 01:08:17.708
I'm fucking done. Let's talk tomorrow.

01:08:23.875 --> 01:08:25.375
-[sighs]
-[knock at door]

01:08:39.667 --> 01:08:40.667
Hi.

01:08:41.833 --> 01:08:42.833
You want to come in?

01:08:43.917 --> 01:08:44.917
Um...

01:08:45.417 --> 01:08:47.333
Could you tell me
what this is about first?

01:08:49.458 --> 01:08:51.000
I owe you an apology.

01:08:52.333 --> 01:08:53.333
I had you wrong.

01:08:54.208 --> 01:08:56.292
And if you're okay with it,

01:08:56.375 --> 01:08:59.042
I would like the opportunity to explain.

01:09:05.833 --> 01:09:07.458
You can have a seat anywhere.

01:09:09.250 --> 01:09:11.917
-Can I get you something to drink?
-I'm good.

01:09:17.417 --> 01:09:18.417
Uh...

01:09:19.000 --> 01:09:20.083
What's that?

01:09:23.333 --> 01:09:26.250
Well, it's information.

01:09:28.375 --> 01:09:29.375
About me?

01:09:30.583 --> 01:09:31.583
Yeah.

01:09:34.250 --> 01:09:35.250
Like what?

01:09:36.042 --> 01:09:37.917
Well, I know your real name,

01:09:38.000 --> 01:09:39.250
Rebecca.

01:09:41.958 --> 01:09:43.458
So, you went through my things.

01:09:45.750 --> 01:09:47.750
Yes, I did.

01:09:51.500 --> 01:09:55.458
And I know that you grew up
in San Bernardino, like Caitlin.

01:09:55.542 --> 01:09:57.708
But her name wasn't Caitlin.

01:09:57.792 --> 01:09:59.083
It was Jennifer.

01:10:00.833 --> 01:10:01.833
Jenny.

01:10:05.083 --> 01:10:07.458
And I know when you were seven,

01:10:08.333 --> 01:10:09.542
you lost everything,

01:10:09.625 --> 01:10:11.917
your whole family, in a fire.

01:10:14.875 --> 01:10:16.208
Yes.

01:10:16.292 --> 01:10:18.292
I can't begin to imagine...

01:10:20.167 --> 01:10:21.917
what that must have been like.

01:10:23.292 --> 01:10:24.292
No.

01:10:25.500 --> 01:10:28.167
In context here, it's important.

01:10:29.000 --> 01:10:30.000
I mean,

01:10:31.375 --> 01:10:35.500
there's no true version of the story
that leaves out what you've been through.

01:10:35.583 --> 01:10:36.583
Yes, there is.

01:10:39.208 --> 01:10:40.292
That's what happened.

01:10:43.708 --> 01:10:45.083
She killed my parents,

01:10:47.417 --> 01:10:48.708
my baby sister,

01:10:50.875 --> 01:10:52.292
and nothing happened to her.

01:10:55.042 --> 01:10:57.833
They changed her name and sent her away.

01:11:03.458 --> 01:11:08.125
I mean, something happened to her
before the fire.

01:11:08.208 --> 01:11:09.292
No, that's not true.

01:11:13.083 --> 01:11:19.583
Regardless, I hope we can agree
that what you're doing to her now,

01:11:19.667 --> 01:11:23.250
to her husband, to her daughters,

01:11:24.417 --> 01:11:28.917
that is not right either, is it?

01:11:32.208 --> 01:11:33.250
[sniffles]

01:11:37.875 --> 01:11:38.875
Did you tell her?

01:11:46.042 --> 01:11:48.958
No. I wanted to talk to you first.

01:11:49.042 --> 01:11:51.375
But if you don't, I will.

01:11:52.792 --> 01:11:54.000
Uh...

01:11:55.542 --> 01:11:56.542
I feel sick.

01:11:57.250 --> 01:11:59.750
Um, can I use the bathroom?

01:11:59.833 --> 01:12:01.125
Yeah, of course. Um...

01:12:01.208 --> 01:12:04.208
It's straight through the doorway here,
just straight ahead.

01:12:05.500 --> 01:12:06.500
[door opens]

01:12:08.083 --> 01:12:09.083
[door closes]

01:12:11.583 --> 01:12:12.667
[sighs]

01:12:14.958 --> 01:12:16.708
[sighs] Buddy.

01:12:16.792 --> 01:12:18.250
[water running]

01:12:19.958 --> 01:12:21.042
You got this.

01:12:26.375 --> 01:12:27.917
Rebecca... Polly,

01:12:29.917 --> 01:12:31.167
can I get you anything?

01:12:31.250 --> 01:12:32.792
[water continues running]

01:12:34.500 --> 01:12:35.500
If it were me,

01:12:37.000 --> 01:12:40.583
I would want the same thing you want,
to see her suffer. But...

01:12:42.250 --> 01:12:45.000
I would hope that
there would be someone there

01:12:45.083 --> 01:12:46.583
to just sympathize,

01:12:47.167 --> 01:12:49.208
and end the cycle of...

01:12:50.083 --> 01:12:51.083
[Polly grunts]

01:12:53.625 --> 01:12:55.958
[panting]

01:13:27.875 --> 01:13:29.292
[Polly] Had to get in there.

01:13:30.833 --> 01:13:32.458
Had to be the savior.

01:13:32.542 --> 01:13:33.667
[Stewart straining]

01:13:56.583 --> 01:13:57.875
You made me do this.

01:13:59.000 --> 01:14:00.583
I hope you realize that.

01:14:04.333 --> 01:14:05.333
[grunts]

01:14:08.375 --> 01:14:12.625
[grunting]

01:14:14.083 --> 01:14:16.083
[Polly panting]

01:14:23.750 --> 01:14:25.000
[Stewart groans softly]

01:14:34.958 --> 01:14:36.208
[cell phone buzzing]

01:14:43.583 --> 01:14:45.750
-Hello?
- [Bethany] Caitlin, it's Bethany.

01:14:46.583 --> 01:14:48.375
-I'm at the hospital.
-What is it? What...

01:14:48.458 --> 01:14:50.417
It's Stewart.
There was a break-in. He's...

01:14:51.125 --> 01:14:52.625
-Oh, my God.
-He's really hurt.

01:14:52.708 --> 01:14:55.208
Okay, I'm coming.
I'm coming now. I'm coming.

01:14:58.583 --> 01:14:59.583
[Miguel] What's going on?

01:15:00.333 --> 01:15:01.708
-It's Stewart.
-What happened?

01:15:02.583 --> 01:15:04.500
-He's been attacked. Just...
-Oh, my God.

01:15:04.583 --> 01:15:06.208
-Stay with the kids, okay?
-Okay.

01:15:09.167 --> 01:15:10.417
[door opens]

01:15:31.542 --> 01:15:33.708
[indistinct conversation]

01:15:33.792 --> 01:15:35.583
-Hi.
-What's going on?

01:15:36.458 --> 01:15:37.875
I'm sorry. Who are you?

01:15:37.958 --> 01:15:39.708
I'm his best friend. How is he?

01:15:40.583 --> 01:15:42.042
-He...
-He's in a tough situation,

01:15:42.125 --> 01:15:43.167
given how he came in.

01:15:43.250 --> 01:15:45.500
So I went to his house
and I opened the door,

01:15:45.583 --> 01:15:46.667
and then he was just...

01:15:47.208 --> 01:15:50.375
He was just lying there on the ground,
and there was so much blood.

01:15:50.458 --> 01:15:52.667
-And then his jaw was just--
-The head trauma?

01:15:52.750 --> 01:15:54.208
-Yes.
-The break-in?

01:15:54.292 --> 01:15:56.125
-Yes.
-Uh...

01:15:56.208 --> 01:15:58.458
Sorry, officer.
I need to speak with you.

01:15:58.542 --> 01:15:59.792
Let me get your number,

01:15:59.875 --> 01:16:02.250
and then I can put you in contact
with the detective in charge.

01:16:02.333 --> 01:16:04.917
Stewart thought that a woman
named Polly Murphy,

01:16:05.000 --> 01:16:08.000
that she was lying to me
and lying to my family.

01:16:08.708 --> 01:16:10.625
-And he was looking into her.
-Wait. Polly?

01:16:10.708 --> 01:16:12.167
-You mean your nanny?
-Yes.

01:16:12.833 --> 01:16:15.583
He believed me, Stewart.
He believed me, and she knew that.

01:16:15.667 --> 01:16:18.083
I'll get you in contact with the officer.
I need you...

01:16:18.167 --> 01:16:20.292
I'm trying to tell you
what's going on here!

01:16:20.375 --> 01:16:21.750
Please, listen to me.

01:16:21.833 --> 01:16:23.750
Ma'am, please lower your voice. Thank you.

01:16:23.833 --> 01:16:24.917
Come with me. Let's go.

01:16:25.708 --> 01:16:27.833
[stutters] I'm really sorry.

01:16:28.833 --> 01:16:31.833
I'm... I'm gonna go to the chapel, okay?

01:16:32.833 --> 01:16:33.833
I'll be back.

01:16:42.750 --> 01:16:44.333
[gate creaking]

01:16:53.958 --> 01:16:56.208
[indistinct conversation]

01:17:08.833 --> 01:17:10.042
How is he?

01:17:10.833 --> 01:17:11.917
Ask her.

01:17:13.708 --> 01:17:15.833
-Okay. What do you...
-Get out!

01:17:16.708 --> 01:17:18.667
-Stop it.
-You can go, too, if you want.

01:17:18.750 --> 01:17:19.792
Mom.

01:17:19.875 --> 01:17:21.458
She's just upset about her friend.

01:17:21.542 --> 01:17:24.500
Stop talking to her and get out!

01:17:24.583 --> 01:17:25.583
Now!

01:17:30.167 --> 01:17:32.375
Oh, fine. Fine.

01:17:59.292 --> 01:18:00.500
[Miguel] Caitlin.

01:18:01.875 --> 01:18:03.833
-Caitlin, listen to me.
-[Caitlin] No.

01:18:03.917 --> 01:18:05.292
I'm done. I'm done!

01:18:05.375 --> 01:18:07.708
Caitlin, stop! Will you...
What are you doing?

01:18:07.792 --> 01:18:09.500
-You, stop it!
-Will you...

01:18:09.583 --> 01:18:11.500
-Will you stop?
-Let me do it!

01:18:16.583 --> 01:18:18.083
You get away from her!

01:18:19.292 --> 01:18:21.292
-Caitlin, stop!
-Mom, what are you doing?

01:18:21.375 --> 01:18:22.708
-Stop! Get off!
-Get off me!

01:18:23.583 --> 01:18:24.583
No! No.

01:18:27.583 --> 01:18:28.750
[Miguel] You okay?

01:18:31.208 --> 01:18:32.375
Let me see. Let me see.

01:18:33.208 --> 01:18:35.042
You're hurt, Emma.
I wanna see. Let me.

01:18:35.583 --> 01:18:37.125
Let me see. Let me see. You okay?

01:18:41.792 --> 01:18:44.292
-Come on. We'll get you up. Come on.
-[Emma whimpers]

01:18:44.875 --> 01:18:46.583
Let's get you in the house.

01:18:46.667 --> 01:18:49.000
[crying]

01:18:58.667 --> 01:19:02.000
[woman over phone] What we need to do is
separate the incident with Polly and Emma,

01:19:02.917 --> 01:19:05.042
which could lead to a restraining order.

01:19:05.125 --> 01:19:06.167
[Caitlin] What about Stewart?

01:19:06.250 --> 01:19:08.708
Caitlin, I'm very sorry
you lost your friend,

01:19:08.792 --> 01:19:11.708
-but it's not going to help us.
-He texted me.

01:19:11.792 --> 01:19:14.958
And then he called her,
the last person, before he died.

01:19:15.042 --> 01:19:16.958
-She has to...
-That's being investigated.

01:19:17.042 --> 01:19:19.042
-We just need you to be patient.
-Fine.

01:19:20.958 --> 01:19:23.083
Fine. I just want to see my kids now.

01:19:23.167 --> 01:19:24.792
Today. I want to see them today.

01:19:25.667 --> 01:19:28.958
The good news is,
Miguel is willing to make that happen.

01:19:29.042 --> 01:19:30.917
But you need to understand,

01:19:31.000 --> 01:19:33.250
he does still need her
to help with the kids.

01:19:35.875 --> 01:19:37.917
You did the right thing
moving out last week,

01:19:38.000 --> 01:19:40.667
but honestly, Caitlin,
in light of what happened,

01:19:40.750 --> 01:19:43.625
the judge could raise the issue
of the children's safety

01:19:43.708 --> 01:19:46.583
-when they're in your care.
-They're unsafe now!

01:19:47.417 --> 01:19:48.917
They are with her now!

01:20:54.792 --> 01:20:55.917
-[objects clattering]
-No!

01:20:59.917 --> 01:21:01.542
[ball bouncing]

01:21:04.042 --> 01:21:05.167
[Miguel] It's okay, sweetheart.

01:21:05.917 --> 01:21:06.958
[Emma] Mom's here.

01:21:09.375 --> 01:21:11.042
All right. Come on, baby. Let's go.

01:21:11.708 --> 01:21:12.708
Come on, go.

01:21:14.167 --> 01:21:15.167
Come on.

01:21:20.917 --> 01:21:22.750
-Hey.
-Hey.

01:21:26.458 --> 01:21:27.458
Did you stretch?

01:21:29.042 --> 01:21:30.042
Not yet.

01:21:32.125 --> 01:21:33.625
-[Miguel] Here's this.
-Thanks.

01:21:35.417 --> 01:21:36.458
Where's Josie?

01:21:39.625 --> 01:21:41.042
She was napping.

01:21:42.583 --> 01:21:45.042
-We agreed I could see her.
-[Miguel] You will.

01:21:46.458 --> 01:21:48.458
Dad, you staying for my game?

01:21:51.167 --> 01:21:52.167
That's fine with me.

01:21:53.583 --> 01:21:54.583
Okay.

01:21:55.208 --> 01:21:57.458
I'll, um... I'll go get us seats.

01:22:00.417 --> 01:22:02.292
[indistinct conversation]

01:22:10.458 --> 01:22:11.458
You're mad at me.

01:22:14.208 --> 01:22:16.042
That's good. That's good. You should be.

01:22:20.667 --> 01:22:22.958
I'm hard on you, Emma.

01:22:23.042 --> 01:22:25.042
And I know I watch you too closely.

01:22:27.667 --> 01:22:29.875
I think because
nobody really watched out for me.

01:22:31.708 --> 01:22:34.458
But that's not your fault, okay?

01:22:35.917 --> 01:22:37.042
It's not your fault.

01:22:39.833 --> 01:22:41.542
Nobody watched out for you?

01:22:44.042 --> 01:22:45.042
No.

01:22:49.833 --> 01:22:51.500
I found this in Polly's room.

01:22:59.625 --> 01:23:00.875
I actually stole it.

01:23:14.083 --> 01:23:15.333
[sobs]

01:23:16.542 --> 01:23:19.542
-Mom... Look...
-[sniffles]

01:23:20.792 --> 01:23:22.542
It says a different name, but...

01:23:24.333 --> 01:23:25.417
that's Polly.

01:23:26.458 --> 01:23:27.458
See?

01:23:28.333 --> 01:23:30.125
She's from where you're from.

01:23:30.667 --> 01:23:32.333
She's an orphan.

01:23:32.417 --> 01:23:35.083
That's why she tries so hard
to be in our family.

01:23:46.333 --> 01:23:47.750
So you can come back now?

01:23:51.958 --> 01:23:52.958
Is that what you want?

01:23:53.042 --> 01:23:54.875
[coach blows whistle]
Players to the court.

01:24:00.208 --> 01:24:01.500
I'm trying, honey.

01:24:11.083 --> 01:24:12.167
[whistle blows]

01:24:12.667 --> 01:24:14.417
[girl] Come on. Come on, let's go.

01:24:40.750 --> 01:24:42.167
[doorbell rings]

01:25:09.542 --> 01:25:10.625
Hi.

01:25:11.917 --> 01:25:13.583
-Josie's still sleeping.
-Rebecca.

01:25:18.875 --> 01:25:20.042
Do you want to come in?

01:25:22.042 --> 01:25:24.000
You look like you could use some water.

01:25:27.167 --> 01:25:28.333
Okay.

01:26:06.875 --> 01:26:08.500
[water running]

01:26:22.458 --> 01:26:23.542
[man] Way to box it out.

01:26:24.500 --> 01:26:26.792
[cheering]

01:26:26.875 --> 01:26:28.583
[Caitlin over voicemail]
Hi, this is Caitlin.

01:26:28.667 --> 01:26:30.917
I can't come to the phone right now.
Please leave a message.

01:26:35.083 --> 01:26:36.792
Come on, guys. Whoo!

01:26:40.667 --> 01:26:43.333
Emma. Emma, we need to go home.

01:26:43.958 --> 01:26:45.500
-Why?
-Come on. We gotta go.

01:26:46.208 --> 01:26:48.042

And you cried and whined
about what happened to you.

They believed you then, didn't they?

01:30:00.833 --> 01:30:02.875

01:30:46.042 --> 01:30:47.167
No.
