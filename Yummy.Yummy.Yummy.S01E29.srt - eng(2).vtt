00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:46.960
Faster, faster.

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:47.930
He's running out of time.

00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:48.760
- OK.
- Quick.

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:53.190
Mr. Lin,

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:54.910
wake up, wake up.

00:01:54.910 --> 00:01:55.750
Mr. Lin.

00:01:56.550 --> 00:01:57.390
Wake up.

00:01:58.120 --> 00:01:58.960
Lin Yan.

00:01:59.470 --> 00:02:00.520
Look at me.

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:01.670
Lin Yan.

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:04.920
Don't sleep.

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:05.830
Look at me.

00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:06.670
Don't sleep.

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:08.110
Don't fall asleep.

00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:10.150
Lin Yan.

00:02:10.480 --> 00:02:11.320
Lin Yan.

00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:12.630
Hurry up.

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:14.150
Hurry up.

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:15.990
Young Master, hang in there.

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:17.870
Young Master, we're almost home.

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:19.710
Hurry up.

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:21.240
Quick.

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:25.040
Young Master!

00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:32.060
(Gentle and Calm)

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:38.150
Lin Yan.

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:40.520
Lin Yan.

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:42.270
Lin Yan.

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:44.760
Lin Yan.

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:45.920
You promised me

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:46.990
that you wouldn't sleep.

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:48.320
Wake up.

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:49.590
Wake up.

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:50.960
Don't sleep.

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:54.550
Don't sleep, don't sleep.

00:02:55.710 --> 00:02:56.920
I promise you

00:02:58.750 --> 00:02:59.710
I won't sleep.

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:03.050
This wound is too deep

00:03:03.050 --> 00:03:04.150
that the organs are visible.

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:05.250
I'm afraid he can't survive.

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:06.080
Don't say that.

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:07.590
Don't.

00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:11.720
As it is written in the book,

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:13.270
there is already a suture technique.

00:03:13.270 --> 00:03:15.270
Didn't Hua Tuo use Mafeisan
to relieve pain?

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:16.240
Doctor,

00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:17.840
you stitched up his wound
with a needle.

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:18.960
No, no.

00:03:18.990 --> 00:03:20.680
I've only read about these in books,

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:22.270
I've never seen anyone actually do this.

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:23.750
I... I don't know how.

00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:25.750
I don't have Mafeisan either.

00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:27.530
At this moment, what are you afraid of?

00:03:27.550 --> 00:03:29.590
You sew like you stitch clothes.

00:03:29.590 --> 00:03:30.870
This is the Vice Prefect.

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:32.340
I can't control the strength well.

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:33.350
If something goes wrong,

00:03:33.370 --> 00:03:34.470
I can't take responsibility.

00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:36.200
Lady, you go find Hua Tuo instead.

00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:37.120
I'm begging you.

00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:37.990
Doctor,

00:03:37.990 --> 00:03:39.030
please save our master.

00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:41.150
Doctor, I'm begging you.

00:03:41.550 --> 00:03:42.800
Doctor, I beg you.

00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:43.990
Please save our master.

00:03:43.990 --> 00:03:44.830
I beg you.

00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:46.710
You can do it, doctor.

00:03:47.020 --> 00:03:47.960
Please save...

00:03:47.960 --> 00:03:48.800
You do it.

00:03:50.270 --> 00:03:51.110
You do it.

00:03:52.310 --> 00:03:53.550
I, I...

00:03:56.150 --> 00:03:56.990
Young Master...

00:03:59.030 --> 00:04:00.200
Jicai, you can do it.

00:04:04.030 --> 00:04:04.870
No, no, no.

00:04:05.310 --> 00:04:06.150
Jicai,

00:04:06.340 --> 00:04:07.520
you are flustered now.

00:04:07.690 --> 00:04:08.700
If you stitch it yourself,

00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:09.750
you'll definitely tremble.

00:04:10.270 --> 00:04:11.110
How about this?

00:04:11.270 --> 00:04:12.110
Let me do it.

00:04:12.220 --> 00:04:13.080
It's just stitching.

00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:14.270
I can sew clothes too.

00:04:14.270 --> 00:04:15.120
If something happens,

00:04:15.130 --> 00:04:16.290
just put all the blame on me.

00:04:18.430 --> 00:04:19.270
Let me do it.

00:04:23.180 --> 00:04:24.020
Let me do it.

00:04:57.700 --> 00:04:58.980
Lady, you use this strong liquor

00:04:58.980 --> 00:05:00.220
and burn it.

00:05:00.460 --> 00:05:01.300
Are you going to...

00:05:01.500 --> 00:05:02.340
Disinfect.

00:05:03.290 --> 00:05:04.340

All rubbish!

00:07:44.060 --> 00:07:45.340
Lin Yan,

00:07:47.220 --> 00:07:49.260
we'll see.

00:07:51.260 --> 00:07:54.060
(Yunshui Manor)

00:07:54.540 --> 00:07:55.380
Let go.

00:07:58.050 --> 00:07:59.180
Lin Yan, you are an official.

00:07:59.180 --> 00:08:00.240
You knowingly break the law

00:08:00.240 --> 00:08:01.320
and imprison a good citizen.

00:08:01.540 --> 00:08:02.380
Let go of my hand.

00:08:03.620 --> 00:08:05.380
I don't understand what you're saying.

00:08:07.180 --> 00:08:08.220
I only know,

00:08:08.400 --> 00:08:10.760
as long as you harden your heart
and break free forcefully,

00:08:11.740 --> 00:08:13.100
you clearly can walk away.

00:08:22.130 --> 00:08:23.120
So,

00:08:24.630 --> 00:08:26.180
this is your choice.

00:08:34.460 --> 00:08:35.300
Lin Yan,

00:08:36.340 --> 00:08:37.900
yes, this is my choice.

00:08:37.900 --> 00:08:39.140
So what?

00:08:39.700 --> 00:08:41.300
Can we cross the boundaries of morality

00:08:41.300 --> 00:08:42.920
and step into the forbidden zone
of love?

00:08:43.350 --> 00:08:44.340
Are you out of your mind?

00:08:44.340 --> 00:08:45.880
You don't choose a healthy relationship,

00:08:45.880 --> 00:08:47.160
but a forbidden romance with me,

00:08:47.160 --> 00:08:47.900
is that so?

00:08:51.060 --> 00:08:52.660
I don't understand what you're saying.

00:08:53.600 --> 00:08:54.940
I don't want to understand either.

00:08:57.300 --> 00:08:58.140
Lin Yan,

00:08:59.550 --> 00:09:01.020
you are the Vice Prefect.

00:09:02.500 --> 00:09:03.740
As long as you don't choose me,

00:09:03.740 --> 00:09:05.660
you will live a very good life.

00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:07.580
You will rise quickly through the ranks.

00:09:07.580 --> 00:09:09.220
You will be promoted and ennobled.

00:09:10.260 --> 00:09:12.340
In the future, a gentle and kind lady

00:09:12.780 --> 00:09:15.140
from a distinguished family
with the surname Shen

00:09:15.380 --> 00:09:16.940
will appear by your side.

00:09:18.820 --> 00:09:21.260
You will have countless descendants,

00:09:24.140 --> 00:09:25.460
including me as well.

00:09:31.340 --> 00:09:32.540
If that person is not you,

00:09:33.820 --> 00:09:34.940
I just wouldn't choose.

00:09:37.020 --> 00:09:38.300
You can't decide for me.

00:09:40.780 --> 00:09:41.620
Shaoguang,

00:09:43.820 --> 00:09:44.700
is this matter

00:09:46.580 --> 00:09:47.940
so serious

00:09:49.860 --> 00:09:51.100
in your era?

00:09:51.510 --> 00:09:52.540
Sure.

00:09:58.660 --> 00:09:59.700
For me,

00:10:01.860 --> 00:10:03.500
this is a disregard
for moral principles,

00:10:04.110 --> 00:10:05.880
destroying ancestors
and being disrespectful,

00:10:07.420 --> 00:10:08.900
obscene and immoral,

00:10:10.500 --> 00:10:11.820
and unfilial and disobedient.

00:10:13.180 --> 00:10:15.420
If the Cui family knew in the afterlife,

00:10:16.170 --> 00:10:17.660
there will be no rest.

00:10:19.540 --> 00:10:20.380
And I

00:10:22.020 --> 00:10:24.020
cannot atone for the crime.

00:10:25.500 --> 00:10:26.340
Clan law,

00:10:26.900 --> 00:10:27.740
rules,

00:10:28.820 --> 00:10:29.740
Heaven and Earth,

00:10:31.820 --> 00:10:34.140
no one will tolerate a shameless sinner
like me.

00:10:42.380 --> 00:10:43.220
But I

00:10:46.180 --> 00:10:47.700
am still unwilling to let go.

00:11:22.020 --> 00:11:25.820
(Yunshui Manor)

00:11:25.820 --> 00:11:26.660
Hu.

00:11:26.940 --> 00:11:27.780
Hu.

00:11:28.940 --> 00:11:29.780
Here.

00:11:30.740 --> 00:11:31.580
Mr. Shen.

00:11:31.600 --> 00:11:32.740
(Yunshui Manor)
Please stop.

00:11:32.740 --> 00:11:33.580
Well,

00:11:33.860 --> 00:11:35.140
what is this?

00:11:35.140 --> 00:11:35.980
What's going on here?

00:11:36.220 --> 00:11:37.220
Mr. Lin

00:11:37.250 --> 00:11:38.620
asked us to keep watch at this door

00:11:38.620 --> 00:11:39.420
these few days.

00:11:39.420 --> 00:11:40.850
No one is allowed to enter or leave.

00:11:41.500 --> 00:11:42.780
Is there another assassin again?

00:11:42.780 --> 00:11:43.860
Has the enemy arrived?

00:11:44.230 --> 00:11:45.100
Well, not really.

00:11:45.100 --> 00:11:46.040
However, he just ordered

00:11:46.040 --> 00:11:47.660
that no one is allowed
to enter or leave.

00:11:47.740 --> 00:11:48.780
Come back another day.

00:12:26.700 --> 00:12:28.180
I am the most shameful coward

00:12:28.180 --> 00:12:30.020
under this sky,

00:12:31.500 --> 00:12:34.500
only daring to secretly
worship you father here.

00:12:34.980 --> 00:12:37.460
I don't even dare to write his name.

00:12:49.020 --> 00:12:49.860
I guess

00:12:50.940 --> 00:12:52.020
my father

00:12:53.670 --> 00:12:55.740
truly regarded you as a close friend.

00:12:58.740 --> 00:12:59.620
You too.

00:13:01.180 --> 00:13:02.260
Otherwise,

00:13:03.180 --> 00:13:05.020
you wouldn't be standing here with me.

00:13:06.180 --> 00:13:07.860
Without you overturning the testimony,

00:13:09.160 --> 00:13:11.740
I could never clear my father's name.

00:13:19.740 --> 00:13:21.580
After falsely accusing your father
that day,

00:13:23.300 --> 00:13:25.820
I was then forced
to become a lackey of Prince Zhao.

00:13:27.460 --> 00:13:28.660
I served as the Grand Tutor,

00:13:29.390 --> 00:13:30.820
recruiting students.

00:13:31.380 --> 00:13:33.500
He would then bring them
under his command

00:13:33.500 --> 00:13:34.660
and send them into the court.

00:13:35.020 --> 00:13:38.860
Ministry of War, Ministry of Revenue,
Ministry of Personnel, Censorate.

00:13:40.820 --> 00:13:41.780
His hand

00:13:42.980 --> 00:13:44.620
has reached too far.

00:13:49.220 --> 00:13:51.460
This habit of recording matters in slips

00:13:52.220 --> 00:13:54.780
was taught to your father
by Fifth Master Xiao back then.

00:13:55.100 --> 00:13:57.660
Your father then taught it to me.

00:13:58.460 --> 00:14:00.540
I have included the entire sequence
of events

00:14:00.740 --> 00:14:01.940
and all the evidence

00:14:02.540 --> 00:14:04.300
within it.

00:14:04.900 --> 00:14:06.780
You present it all to His Majesty.

00:14:13.620 --> 00:14:14.820
According to the law,

00:14:15.060 --> 00:14:17.460
even if I testify against the sinner,

00:14:17.460 --> 00:14:18.980
I will also be put to death.

00:14:23.860 --> 00:14:25.900
Could you consider this

00:14:27.980 --> 00:14:28.860
my repayment?

00:14:31.820 --> 00:14:33.860
Your countless deaths
cannot redeem the crime,

00:14:35.380 --> 00:14:36.980
unable to repay even a fraction.

00:14:54.380 --> 00:14:55.380
However, I think,

00:14:57.140 --> 00:14:58.540
with the disposition of my father,

00:15:00.820 --> 00:15:02.020
if you go to keep him company

00:15:02.460 --> 00:15:03.740
he is still willing

00:15:05.770 --> 00:15:07.140
to talk about books
and philosophy

00:15:07.140 --> 00:15:08.900
together with you in the netherworld.

00:15:46.760 --> 00:15:48.140
Is your body made of iron?

00:15:48.440 --> 00:15:49.990
Where have you been these past few days?

00:15:51.460 --> 00:15:52.580
Go see Mentor Zhao

00:15:53.860 --> 00:15:56.100
and pay respects to my father with him.

00:15:59.860 --> 00:16:00.790
With this reason,

00:16:00.800 --> 00:16:02.500
I can't hold anything against you yet.

00:16:05.140 --> 00:16:06.200
I thought

00:16:06.890 --> 00:16:08.140
you will ask me immediately

00:16:08.670 --> 00:16:09.700
when I will let you go.

00:16:11.220 --> 00:16:12.060
But you

00:16:12.620 --> 00:16:13.740
care more about me.

00:16:29.020 --> 00:16:29.860
Lin Yan,

00:16:30.700 --> 00:16:33.220
I've told you I don't like the story
of the weaving maiden.

00:16:33.380 --> 00:16:34.540
Her clothes were hidden away

00:16:34.540 --> 00:16:35.860
and she was trapped.

00:17:00.740 --> 00:17:01.580
Sorry.

00:17:02.940 --> 00:17:03.780
Lin Yan,

00:17:05.420 --> 00:17:06.420
by trapping me like this,

00:17:06.420 --> 00:17:08.360
you're only making things difficult
for yourself.

00:17:09.660 --> 00:17:11.940
You originally only liked me a little.

00:17:12.140 --> 00:17:13.220
But by locking me up,

00:17:13.220 --> 00:17:14.540
you're forcing yourself

00:17:14.540 --> 00:17:16.380
to keep increasing your investment
and burden.

00:17:16.700 --> 00:17:17.800
The more you try to trap me,

00:17:17.800 --> 00:17:18.980
the more you trap yourself.

00:17:20.380 --> 00:17:21.420
Is it necessary?

00:17:23.500 --> 00:17:24.540
We can always manage to

00:17:24.540 --> 00:17:25.980
to forget each other.

00:17:31.660 --> 00:17:32.580
I can't.

00:17:41.020 --> 00:17:42.300
Then give it a try.

00:17:44.100 --> 00:17:45.380
It's not that hard.

00:17:53.500 --> 00:17:54.880
Let's pretend nothing ever happened

00:17:54.880 --> 00:17:56.460
between us from now on.

00:18:13.700 --> 00:18:15.380
(Shen's Diner)

00:18:15.380 --> 00:18:17.020
He locked her up for so many days.

00:18:17.420 --> 00:18:19.060
Mr. Lin

00:18:19.340 --> 00:18:20.460
was messing around.

00:18:21.220 --> 00:18:23.140
Well, this...

00:18:23.140 --> 00:18:25.580
I don't know. The key thing now
is that we don't know anything.

00:18:25.580 --> 00:18:27.180
Our ancestor was the Vice Prefect.

00:18:27.180 --> 00:18:28.100
What can we do?

00:18:28.100 --> 00:18:29.380
File a complaint to the Emperor?

00:18:29.380 --> 00:18:30.060
We can't.

00:18:30.060 --> 00:18:31.500
After all, he is our ancestor.

00:18:31.500 --> 00:18:33.180
If we sue him,
we will be punished by God.

00:18:33.180 --> 00:18:34.380
She is Jicai.

00:18:34.500 --> 00:18:36.300
I'm telling you if it really happens,

00:18:36.860 --> 00:18:38.220
I will kill your ancestor.

00:18:38.380 --> 00:18:40.100
If this really happened,

00:18:40.100 --> 00:18:41.820
I would kill him myself, OK?

00:18:41.820 --> 00:18:42.660
But

00:18:42.820 --> 00:18:43.900
I think our ancestor

00:18:44.340 --> 00:18:45.780
would never do such a thing.

00:18:46.420 --> 00:18:47.260
Come on.

00:18:47.700 --> 00:18:48.620
How could we do?

00:18:48.620 --> 00:18:50.580
A man and a woman alone in a room.

00:18:51.020 --> 00:18:52.540
Oh my god.

00:18:54.060 --> 00:18:55.860
Jicai. Jicai.

00:18:55.860 --> 00:18:56.790
- Jicai.
- Jicai.

00:18:56.790 --> 00:18:57.660
Are you alright?

00:18:57.660 --> 00:18:58.500
Jicai,

00:18:58.500 --> 00:18:59.580
has something happened?

00:18:59.860 --> 00:19:00.860
Jicai, how are you?

00:19:00.860 --> 00:19:01.750
Is everything alright?

00:19:02.020 --> 00:19:03.420
- Is everything alright?
- No.

00:19:03.420 --> 00:19:05.660
Do you want me
to make you something tasty?

00:19:05.940 --> 00:19:07.340
Jicai, just tell me

00:19:07.340 --> 00:19:09.300
what you need me to do right now.

00:19:09.300 --> 00:19:11.340
Jicai, no matter what happens,
you should tell us.

00:19:11.500 --> 00:19:12.380
I'm fine.

00:19:12.380 --> 00:19:13.900
Nothing has happened.

00:19:14.540 --> 00:19:16.180
Mr. Lin just got injured.

00:19:16.180 --> 00:19:17.620
I took care of him for a few days.

00:19:17.860 --> 00:19:18.740
That's it.

00:19:19.380 --> 00:19:20.500
I'll go rest first.

00:19:21.820 --> 00:19:22.660
Have a rest.

00:19:25.460 --> 00:19:26.300
Father.

00:19:26.460 --> 00:19:27.300
Mother.

00:19:27.500 --> 00:19:28.660
I told you so.

00:19:28.830 --> 00:19:30.820
That kind of thing won't happen.
You're all too...

00:19:30.820 --> 00:19:32.140
I just said that such a thing

00:19:32.140 --> 00:19:33.420
is simply impossible to happen.

00:19:33.420 --> 00:19:35.380
Your mother's just read too many novels.

00:19:37.500 --> 00:19:38.540
Why do you pinch me again?

00:19:38.540 --> 00:19:39.580
As long as she's fine.

00:19:40.940 --> 00:19:41.780
That's right.

00:19:58.660 --> 00:19:59.820
Bear with it.

00:20:05.900 --> 00:20:06.740
Father,

00:20:07.460 --> 00:20:08.860
all that I am today

00:20:10.280 --> 00:20:12.380
is caused by Lin Yan.

00:20:13.020 --> 00:20:14.820
If my elder brother were still alive,

00:20:15.580 --> 00:20:17.640
he would cut Lin Yan into pieces

00:20:17.650 --> 00:20:18.800
to revenge me.

00:20:35.620 --> 00:20:36.500
Take action.

00:20:36.500 --> 00:20:37.340
Yes.

00:20:42.340 --> 00:20:45.100
(Zichen Hall)

00:20:47.560 --> 00:20:49.100
The palace is celebrating the festival.

00:20:49.100 --> 00:20:50.760
His Majesty is inconvenient
to summon you.

00:20:50.760 --> 00:20:51.740
I have important matters.

00:20:51.740 --> 00:20:53.230
I've previously sent people to report.

00:20:53.320 --> 00:20:55.090
I must see His Majesty
as soon as possible.

00:20:57.540 --> 00:20:58.380
Wait.

00:20:58.940 --> 00:21:00.100
Why is it not Eunuch Qin

00:21:00.100 --> 00:21:01.450
conveying His Majesty's intentions?

00:21:01.500 --> 00:21:02.660
Eunuch Qin is ill.

00:21:12.620 --> 00:21:14.340
Your expression is not good.

00:21:14.940 --> 00:21:16.580
Things didn't go smoothly, huh?

00:21:18.900 --> 00:21:20.060
I failed to see His Majesty.

00:21:21.580 --> 00:21:22.980
The one who came out to see me today

00:21:22.980 --> 00:21:24.700
was a young eunuch
I had never seen before.

00:21:24.900 --> 00:21:26.140
He said that Eunuch Qin was ill.

00:21:26.800 --> 00:21:28.420
But how could there be
an unfamiliar face

00:21:28.420 --> 00:21:29.900
around His Majesty?

00:21:30.340 --> 00:21:31.180
Yeah.

00:21:31.580 --> 00:21:32.620
That's exactly the problem.

00:21:33.020 --> 00:21:33.980
Eunuch Qin has asked us

00:21:33.980 --> 00:21:35.100
to meet his people.

00:21:35.380 --> 00:21:36.460
Even if he is sick,

00:21:36.600 --> 00:21:38.760
it will still be them coming out
to deliver the message.

00:21:39.260 --> 00:21:40.260
It shouldn't be

00:21:40.260 --> 00:21:41.580
a strange young eunuch.

00:21:42.460 --> 00:21:43.500
Yes.

00:21:44.740 --> 00:21:46.070
Is Mr. Lin in the carriage?

00:21:46.070 --> 00:21:46.910
Mr. Pei.

00:21:46.920 --> 00:21:47.770
He is.

00:21:49.660 --> 00:21:50.500
Twelfth Master.

00:21:50.500 --> 00:21:51.340
Anran.

00:21:51.400 --> 00:21:53.380
I'm planning to go
to Yunshui Manor to find you.

00:21:53.380 --> 00:21:54.580
Fortunately, I came across you.

00:21:54.580 --> 00:21:56.180
Why in such a hurry?
What's the matter?

00:21:56.180 --> 00:21:57.260
Let's talk in the carriage.

00:22:00.380 --> 00:22:01.220
What's the matter?

00:22:02.660 --> 00:22:03.500
It's like this.

00:22:03.940 --> 00:22:05.020
Today,

00:22:05.820 --> 00:22:09.060
I passed by the Princess Mansion
by chance.

00:22:10.020 --> 00:22:11.020
Then...

00:22:14.200 --> 00:22:15.580
Well, maybe not entirely by chance.

00:22:16.180 --> 00:22:17.300
My mother

00:22:17.300 --> 00:22:19.020
had someone bring me
some rice dumplings.

00:22:19.020 --> 00:22:19.980
It's quite tasty.

00:22:19.980 --> 00:22:20.980
I... I just want

00:22:21.500 --> 00:22:23.500
to deliver them for her to try.

00:22:23.950 --> 00:22:24.960
But that's not the point.

00:22:24.960 --> 00:22:25.930
The point is

00:22:25.930 --> 00:22:27.330
that people in this mansion said

00:22:27.330 --> 00:22:29.380
the Princess went to the palace
early in the morning

00:22:29.380 --> 00:22:31.140
to celebrate the Dragon Boat Festival.

00:22:31.810 --> 00:22:32.700
Early in the morning?

00:22:32.700 --> 00:22:34.220
Yes, early in the morning.

00:22:34.220 --> 00:22:35.900
This time can be said to be strange

00:22:35.900 --> 00:22:36.980
but also reasonable,

00:22:37.300 --> 00:22:38.500
and if you say it's reasonable,

00:22:39.140 --> 00:22:40.540
it's still somewhat strange.

00:22:40.780 --> 00:22:43.220
After all, she only entered the palace
at noon in the past.

00:22:43.800 --> 00:22:45.120
In the morning, the Crown Prince

00:22:45.380 --> 00:22:47.060
always goes to the Hongwen Academy

00:22:47.190 --> 00:22:48.260
for half a day.

00:22:50.830 --> 00:22:51.940
Go to the Hongwen Academy.

00:22:52.660 --> 00:22:53.580
Go to Hongwen Academy.

00:22:59.740 --> 00:23:01.740
(Shen's Diner)

00:23:01.740 --> 00:23:03.250
Something would happen
in the palace.

00:23:03.250 --> 00:23:04.780
Yangyang is still in the palace.

00:23:05.450 --> 00:23:06.700
Around 8 o'clock in the morning,

00:23:06.700 --> 00:23:09.140
the Crown Prince was invited
to the palace for the festival.

00:23:09.180 --> 00:23:10.020
Yangyang was curious,

00:23:10.180 --> 00:23:12.260
so the Crown Prince then took her along.

00:23:12.940 --> 00:23:15.060
What is there for her
to be curious about?

00:23:15.260 --> 00:23:16.300
She didn't study properly.

00:23:16.300 --> 00:23:17.620
Why did she go to the palace?

00:23:17.870 --> 00:23:19.500
What will happen in the palace?

00:23:19.740 --> 00:23:21.300
Is there really going to be an accident?

00:23:22.260 --> 00:23:23.140
History textbooks

00:23:23.140 --> 00:23:24.400
never recorded this rebellion.

00:23:24.400 --> 00:23:25.560
When my grandpa told stories,

00:23:25.560 --> 00:23:26.780
he never mentioned it at all.

00:23:26.860 --> 00:23:28.100
That means Prince Zhao

00:23:28.100 --> 00:23:29.740
didn't cause much of a stir this time.

00:23:29.740 --> 00:23:31.060
It's not even worth noting down.

00:23:31.070 --> 00:23:32.060
Yes, yes, yes.

00:23:33.860 --> 00:23:35.180
Before going to Fenglin Town,

00:23:36.100 --> 00:23:37.720
I entered the palace
to meet His Majesty.

00:23:39.300 --> 00:23:41.020
Your playing chess today actually

00:23:41.020 --> 00:23:43.780
incite me to pursue dominance.

00:23:44.380 --> 00:23:45.660
I have suspended your post

00:23:45.660 --> 00:23:47.460
and ordered you to rest at home.

00:23:48.010 --> 00:23:49.900
But you should be clear in your heart

00:23:50.000 --> 00:23:52.460
that you are the aide
I intend to keep for Xu.

00:23:52.590 --> 00:23:54.080
I trust you without doubt.

00:23:55.020 --> 00:23:57.580
You insisted on seeing me today.

00:23:58.260 --> 00:24:01.100
It's not just to accompany me
in playing chess, right?

00:24:02.180 --> 00:24:03.460
Why I came here,

00:24:04.100 --> 00:24:04.940
I'm sure

00:24:05.460 --> 00:24:07.540
you already know.

00:24:11.300 --> 00:24:12.140
Prince Zhao.

00:24:27.740 --> 00:24:30.220
His Majesty got 16.

00:24:30.220 --> 00:24:31.260
Complete victory.

00:24:36.220 --> 00:24:37.460
No, what do you mean by that?

00:24:37.460 --> 00:24:38.740
I really don't understand at all.

00:24:38.740 --> 00:24:39.700
The key now is Yangyang.

00:24:39.720 --> 00:24:40.700
What can she do?

00:24:41.450 --> 00:24:42.820
What Lin Yan means is

00:24:42.820 --> 00:24:44.300
His Majesty has long been aware

00:24:44.300 --> 00:24:45.660
of Prince Zhao's wolfish ambitions.

00:24:45.890 --> 00:24:47.900
Although he doesn't know
when he will take action,

00:24:47.900 --> 00:24:48.980
it means that the palace

00:24:48.980 --> 00:24:50.200
has been prepared at all times.

00:24:50.200 --> 00:24:51.280
Be careful with your words.

00:24:51.660 --> 00:24:52.660
Due to my position,

00:24:52.660 --> 00:24:53.700
I shouldn't say too much.

00:24:54.020 --> 00:24:55.420
But I have to reassure you.

00:24:56.260 --> 00:24:57.100
I promise

00:24:57.620 --> 00:24:58.900
Yangyang will be fine.

00:25:03.020 --> 00:25:04.100
I have to leave first.

00:25:04.100 --> 00:25:05.140
You stay here

00:25:05.140 --> 00:25:06.060
to wait for my news.

00:25:10.420 --> 00:25:12.220
Mr. Lin, hurry up.

00:25:13.620 --> 00:25:14.460
Well...

00:25:14.460 --> 00:25:16.300
(Xuanzheng Gate)

00:26:07.500 --> 00:26:08.340
Brother,

00:26:10.460 --> 00:26:11.740
at this Dragon Boat Festival,

00:26:12.700 --> 00:26:14.380
we will shoot glutinous rice balls.

00:26:14.780 --> 00:26:15.860
So today,

00:26:16.140 --> 00:26:18.460
I invite some sons and nephews of us

00:26:18.810 --> 00:26:20.100
to the palace to play.

00:26:23.380 --> 00:26:24.740
These little princes

00:26:24.740 --> 00:26:26.940
have all grown dull in peaceful times.

00:26:27.420 --> 00:26:28.460
They don't expect

00:26:29.300 --> 00:26:31.550
they also have the possibility
of taking over the throne.

00:27:20.060 --> 00:27:21.540
So much fun!

00:27:21.540 --> 00:27:22.380
Take it.

00:27:24.620 --> 00:27:26.980
Even if you kill them all,

00:27:27.340 --> 00:27:28.500
you may not necessarily

00:27:29.300 --> 00:27:31.460
firmly hold this position.

00:27:34.140 --> 00:27:34.980
That's why

00:27:35.900 --> 00:27:39.380
I ask for rightful justification.

00:27:42.140 --> 00:27:43.620
You've been gravely ill for many days.

00:27:43.940 --> 00:27:45.060
The Crown Prince was unfilial

00:27:45.060 --> 00:27:46.260
and never attended to illness.

00:27:46.500 --> 00:27:47.900
He actually planned this palace coup

00:27:48.180 --> 00:27:50.340
at the Dragon Boat Festival

00:27:50.580 --> 00:27:51.900
to force you to abdicate.

00:27:52.940 --> 00:27:54.540
I truly have no choice

00:27:54.930 --> 00:27:57.900
but purge the Emperor's close aides.

00:28:00.420 --> 00:28:01.260
So,

00:28:02.600 --> 00:28:04.640
about the imperial edict
to depose the Crown Prince,

00:28:05.740 --> 00:28:07.140
have you thought

00:28:07.620 --> 00:28:08.860
how it should be written?

00:28:21.460 --> 00:28:22.420
Well,

00:28:22.420 --> 00:28:24.060
I want to know how Yangyang is now.

00:28:24.060 --> 00:28:25.060
Is she cold or hungry?

00:28:25.060 --> 00:28:26.220
Is she scared or not?

00:28:26.300 --> 00:28:28.200
Yangyang has been blessed
since she was a child.

00:28:28.300 --> 00:28:30.290
She can definitely turn misfortune
into blessing.

00:28:30.290 --> 00:28:31.100
Definitely.

00:28:32.900 --> 00:28:33.780
Definitely.

00:28:34.780 --> 00:28:35.660
Gongcai,

00:28:35.660 --> 00:28:36.820
can you stop walking around?

00:28:36.820 --> 00:28:38.340
It has made me dizzy.

00:28:38.340 --> 00:28:39.740
The ancestor knows what's going on.

00:28:39.740 --> 00:28:40.820
Yangyang will be fine.

00:28:41.620 --> 00:28:43.180
Father, Mother,

00:28:43.240 --> 00:28:44.410
I'd better go to the palace.

00:28:44.480 --> 00:28:46.000
It's not that I don't trust him.

00:28:46.010 --> 00:28:47.420
But Yangyang is my daughter.

00:28:47.420 --> 00:28:48.500
I can't just stand here

00:28:48.500 --> 00:28:50.020
and don't do anything at all.

00:28:50.020 --> 00:28:51.080
Alright, alright, alright.

00:28:51.080 --> 00:28:52.580
Don't rush.

00:28:52.580 --> 00:28:54.340
If you go, we'll definitely go together.

00:28:54.340 --> 00:28:55.500
But I'm just worried

00:28:55.710 --> 00:28:56.740
if we go there,

00:28:56.740 --> 00:28:58.090
we will make things worse instead.

00:28:58.170 --> 00:29:00.020
- At this moment...
- How could it be worse?

00:29:00.020 --> 00:29:01.020
They have rebelled.

00:29:01.020 --> 00:29:02.460
Is there anything worse than this?

00:29:02.460 --> 00:29:03.960
Three ordinary people together

00:29:03.960 --> 00:29:05.120
can be as wise as a great man.

00:29:05.120 --> 00:29:06.020
We are four people.

00:29:06.020 --> 00:29:08.020
I want to enter the palace
to rescue them.

00:29:08.020 --> 00:29:09.540
Yeah, enter the palace.

00:29:09.540 --> 00:29:10.500
Rescue them.

00:29:10.500 --> 00:29:11.630
Hurry, hurry, hurry.

00:29:40.580 --> 00:29:43.180
(Xiande Hall)

00:29:49.700 --> 00:29:50.540
Xu,

00:29:51.740 --> 00:29:53.660
write a confession letter,

00:29:53.780 --> 00:29:56.780
saying that you deliberately
injured your father

00:29:56.780 --> 00:29:58.380
during the Dragon Boat Festival banquet,

00:29:58.380 --> 00:29:59.380
which caused his death.

00:29:59.660 --> 00:30:01.540
This is considered infidelity,

00:30:02.420 --> 00:30:03.260
being unfilial,

00:30:03.660 --> 00:30:04.540
and ingratitude.

00:30:04.760 --> 00:30:06.000
What have you done to my father?

00:30:14.380 --> 00:30:15.300
Li Ang,

00:30:16.060 --> 00:30:17.940
your father is obstinately refusing
to change.

00:30:19.180 --> 00:30:21.220
You still have a chance to repent.

00:30:21.540 --> 00:30:22.500
Aunt,

00:30:23.980 --> 00:30:26.100
no matter who holds the Imperial Seal,

00:30:26.100 --> 00:30:27.540
you are still the Princess.

00:30:30.020 --> 00:30:31.820
If you side with Li Xu,

00:30:32.060 --> 00:30:34.380
you can only be posthumously
awarded a title after death.

00:30:36.340 --> 00:30:37.660
You better think it over.

00:30:44.260 --> 00:30:45.620
As long as you write this,

00:30:45.780 --> 00:30:48.460
I will immediately take you
to see your father.

00:31:22.700 --> 00:31:23.980
You can't write.

00:31:23.980 --> 00:31:25.360
Once you write it, you're done for.

00:31:25.600 --> 00:31:27.100
Do you think he will let us go?

00:31:30.900 --> 00:31:32.460
Courting death!

00:31:52.780 --> 00:31:53.700
Let them go.

00:31:54.460 --> 00:31:55.820
Otherwise, I would rather die

00:31:56.420 --> 00:31:57.860
that comply with your wishes.

00:31:58.540 --> 00:32:00.740
You are not qualified
to negotiate with me.

00:32:21.740 --> 00:32:22.660
Uncle Liu Chang.

00:32:22.660 --> 00:32:23.900
Yangyang, are you OK?

00:32:25.700 --> 00:32:26.660
Are you OK?

00:32:26.660 --> 00:32:28.740
Yangyang, don't be afraid.

00:32:30.020 --> 00:32:31.220
I came late.

00:32:32.140 --> 00:32:33.660
Stop crying, stop crying.

00:32:38.620 --> 00:32:39.500
You go first.

00:32:39.500 --> 00:32:40.340
I'll cover the rear.

00:33:00.940 --> 00:33:01.980
No, no, no.

00:33:03.020 --> 00:33:04.260
You are not Lin Yan.

00:33:14.180 --> 00:33:15.980
Hurry.

00:33:17.780 --> 00:33:18.660
Yu San,

00:33:18.660 --> 00:33:19.700
you dare betray us.

00:33:19.900 --> 00:33:21.820
Do you and your family not want
to live anymore?

00:33:21.820 --> 00:33:23.260
You probably still don't know

00:33:23.620 --> 00:33:25.740
how many hostages have gone missing
in Fenglin Town.

00:33:25.760 --> 00:33:27.940
Mr. Lin has already sent someone
to rescue my parents.

00:33:28.140 --> 00:33:29.040
You're courting death.

00:33:42.400 --> 00:33:43.570
What are you hiding here for?

00:33:45.580 --> 00:33:47.060
You're really skilled!

00:33:47.200 --> 00:33:48.330
Why didn't you do it earlier?

00:33:48.330 --> 00:33:49.410
I almost died!

00:33:49.420 --> 00:33:50.900
Stop nonsense. Come with me quickly.

00:33:57.740 --> 00:33:58.580
Mount it.

00:34:03.620 --> 00:34:04.460
What's wrong?

00:34:04.900 --> 00:34:06.620
How did you ride your horse just now?

00:34:07.780 --> 00:34:08.620
Just now I...

00:34:09.200 --> 00:34:11.180
I'm doing this
for the sake of national interests,

00:34:11.180 --> 00:34:12.060
for the sake of Anran.

00:34:12.920 --> 00:34:13.940
Anran and I have also been

00:34:13.940 --> 00:34:15.660
through life-and-death situations now.

00:34:15.660 --> 00:34:17.040
You first meet up with the Princess

00:34:17.040 --> 00:34:17.880
later in the palace.

00:34:17.900 --> 00:34:19.270
I will hold off Prince Zhao's men.

00:34:25.540 --> 00:34:29.940
(Edict of Abdication)

00:34:34.620 --> 00:34:36.220
If you're unwilling to write,

00:34:36.900 --> 00:34:38.660
then I will write it for you.

00:34:39.740 --> 00:34:41.780
As long as you sign and seal it,

00:34:42.080 --> 00:34:45.030
hand over the Imperial Seal
and the Military Tally,

00:34:46.260 --> 00:34:48.220
I shall honor you
as the Emperor Emeritus.

00:34:48.820 --> 00:34:49.660
How about it?

00:34:53.060 --> 00:34:54.340
Li,

00:34:55.800 --> 00:34:57.940
you kill your brother and nephew.

00:34:58.510 --> 00:35:00.450
How could you be worthy

00:35:01.450 --> 00:35:05.140
of this Heaven-mandated Imperial Seal?

00:35:05.500 --> 00:35:07.460
Kill my brother and nephew?

00:35:09.380 --> 00:35:11.060
Who knows?

00:35:11.500 --> 00:35:12.780
The palace is locked.

00:35:12.780 --> 00:35:14.860
Not a single bit of news has leaked.

00:35:14.860 --> 00:35:16.300
The world will only know

00:35:17.180 --> 00:35:20.220
that the one who committed regicide
was the Crown Prince, Li Xu.

00:35:20.540 --> 00:35:21.380
I,

00:35:21.860 --> 00:35:22.980
forced by circumstances,

00:35:23.100 --> 00:35:24.550
will only then take over the throne.

00:35:33.820 --> 00:35:35.740
I will ask you one last time.

00:35:36.020 --> 00:35:38.380
Where exactly are the Military Tally
and the Imperial Seal?
