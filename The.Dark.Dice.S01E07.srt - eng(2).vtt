WEBVTT

00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:02.900
I’ll buy a ladder card
and get you to the floor above.

00:00:02.990 --> 00:00:03.990
You will?

00:00:04.160 --> 00:00:07.010
I told you I wanted to help you win.

00:00:07.510 --> 00:00:10.130
Aom didn’t show any signs of
interest in Mark before.

00:00:10.570 --> 00:00:12.200
Don’t you think that’s strange?

00:00:12.910 --> 00:00:13.910
Where’s Mark?

00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:15.950
Game over.

00:00:16.040 --> 00:00:17.700
Players can now leave the game.

00:00:21.100 --> 00:00:22.100
Aom.

00:00:22.180 --> 00:00:24.016
You made sure Mark was left behind
in the game, didn’t you?

00:00:24.040 --> 00:00:25.760
Why would I do
what you accused me of doing?

00:00:26.110 --> 00:00:27.900
Because you wanted to get back at me.

00:00:30.930 --> 00:00:31.930
Pan.

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:39.330
WELCOME TO OUR SCHOOL’S ANNUAL FAIR 1995

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:42.240
Here are some ropes and decorations.

00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:43.370
Thanks.

00:00:50.050 --> 00:00:51.150
You scared me.

00:00:52.870 --> 00:00:54.100
Let’s play some music.

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:58.600
“What we feel inside.”

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:02.330
“Only time will tell.”

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:05.556
Do you think our school is going to hire
some artists for the fair this year?

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:10.000
It would be amazing if someone famous
like Tao or Mos showed up.

00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:11.040
Keep dreaming.

00:01:11.620 --> 00:01:14.940
Those two are signed with different labels.
There’s no way they’ll show up together.

00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:20.000
Aom, I think we need more fabric.

00:01:20.650 --> 00:01:21.780
I’ll go find some more.

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:23.500
- Thanks.
- Help me with this.

00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:34.900
- Aom?
- You okay?

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:49.800
What’s that dice?

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:51.760
There’s a weird pattern on it.

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:53.400
Why don’t you try rolling it?

00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:07.260
Is the game dead set on killing us all?

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:11.500
Guys, look!

00:03:17.330 --> 00:03:17.940
You alright?

00:03:17.960 --> 00:03:19.000
I’m okay.

00:03:21.550 --> 00:03:23.586
How are we gonna get out of here?
That thing is right in front of the door.

00:03:23.610 --> 00:03:24.610
What should we do, Aom?

00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:29.800
I have a plan, but…

00:03:30.740 --> 00:03:31.740
But what?

00:03:33.300 --> 00:03:34.700
We can’t all leave, Pan.

00:03:34.960 --> 00:03:36.100
Someone has to stay behind.

00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:43.600
The only way we can get out is
for someone to divert his attention

00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:45.420
while the rest runs for the door.

00:03:45.890 --> 00:03:46.890
But who will do that?

00:03:47.100 --> 00:03:49.500
The slowest person right now is…

00:03:55.290 --> 00:03:57.250
No! Pan is injured.

00:03:57.370 --> 00:03:59.170
It’s too dangerous for her
to stay any longer.

00:04:00.270 --> 00:04:02.700
Should we… vote?

00:04:07.190 --> 00:04:08.190
I’ll stay.

00:04:08.860 --> 00:04:10.876
But you guys need to take Pan to the
hospital as soon as you get out of here.

00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:12.630
- No, Aom!
- I’ll buy you some time.

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:14.000
Aom, no!

00:04:14.050 --> 00:04:15.460
We’re only wasting our time
if we keep arguing!

00:04:15.480 --> 00:04:16.700
You have to come with me.

00:04:17.590 --> 00:04:18.700
Don’t worry about me.

00:04:19.590 --> 00:04:21.300
I’ll wait for you to come back
and save me.

00:04:22.170 --> 00:04:23.620
Once I get out of here,

00:04:24.790 --> 00:04:26.470
you can make good on
that promise of yours.

00:04:33.980 --> 00:04:34.980
Hey!

00:04:54.430 --> 00:04:55.430
Run.

00:04:56.040 --> 00:04:57.040
Pan!

00:04:57.080 --> 00:04:57.700
Run!

00:04:58.070 --> 00:04:58.600
Pan!

00:04:58.740 --> 00:04:59.850
- Aom…
- You have to run!

00:05:00.100 --> 00:05:00.650
Hurry up.

00:05:00.890 --> 00:05:01.890
We need to go.

00:05:02.180 --> 00:05:02.730
Let’s go.

00:05:02.820 --> 00:05:03.310
Aom.

00:05:03.550 --> 00:05:04.100
Come on.

00:05:04.190 --> 00:05:05.190
- Aom!
- Let’s go.

00:05:06.900 --> 00:05:07.900
Hurry up.

00:05:09.830 --> 00:05:10.830
Pan, we have to go.

00:05:10.920 --> 00:05:11.920
Get in.

00:05:28.910 --> 00:05:30.050
Pan is coming back for me.

00:05:30.290 --> 00:05:31.410
Pan is coming back for me.

00:05:31.860 --> 00:05:32.900
Pan is coming back for me.

00:05:33.390 --> 00:05:34.430
Pan is coming back for me.

00:05:36.120 --> 00:05:37.520
Pan is coming back for me.

00:05:38.180 --> 00:05:39.400
Pan is coming back for me.

00:05:43.500 --> 00:05:50.100
Pan is coming back for me.

00:05:57.250 --> 00:05:58.250
Hey.

00:06:02.150 --> 00:06:03.150
Hey.

00:06:06.370 --> 00:06:07.370
Hey.

00:06:09.880 --> 00:06:10.880
Easy! Easy!

00:06:12.470 --> 00:06:14.800
Do you remember how you got here?

00:06:15.740 --> 00:06:17.100
I don’t remember anything.

00:06:18.530 --> 00:06:20.300
Next thing I know I was here.

00:06:23.120 --> 00:06:25.600
All eight players, get ready for the game.

00:06:27.790 --> 00:06:30.020
What day is today and what year is it?

00:06:30.500 --> 00:06:33.500
It’s January 27, 2025.

00:07:58.390 --> 00:07:59.800
Where have you gone, my dear?

00:08:00.860 --> 00:08:02.400
Why aren’t you coming home?

00:08:08.390 --> 00:08:09.680
I miss you.

00:08:18.840 --> 00:08:19.840
Aom.

00:08:26.110 --> 00:08:27.110
Mom.

00:08:30.100 --> 00:08:31.100
Mom.

00:08:31.550 --> 00:08:32.800
I’m home.

00:08:35.990 --> 00:08:36.990
Aom?

00:08:38.080 --> 00:08:39.080
Aom.

00:08:39.650 --> 00:08:40.650
It’s really you, Aom.

00:08:41.230 --> 00:08:42.230
Aom!

00:08:45.320 --> 00:08:46.320
Aom.

00:08:47.800 --> 00:08:49.450
- Mom.
- Don’t go away again, my dear.

00:08:51.590 --> 00:08:53.000
I’m never leaving you again.

00:08:53.710 --> 00:08:54.850
I promise.

00:09:02.840 --> 00:09:07.050
FAMILY BEGS FOR DAUGHTER’S RETURN
FOLLOWING MYSTERIOUS DISAPPEARANCE

00:09:09.810 --> 00:09:11.180
2025…

00:09:12.400 --> 00:09:13.800
It’s been 30 years?

00:09:49.070 --> 00:09:50.070
Pan?

00:09:50.270 --> 00:09:50.850
Mom!

00:09:51.230 --> 00:09:52.230
Yes, love?

00:09:52.800 --> 00:09:54.100
Have you seen my shirt anywhere?

00:09:54.230 --> 00:09:56.030
Your shirt? It’s where it always is.

00:09:56.070 --> 00:09:56.730
“Mom”?

00:09:56.770 --> 00:09:58.150
It’s over there.

00:10:28.420 --> 00:10:31.450
You’re the student
who disappeared 30 years ago.

00:10:32.490 --> 00:10:35.070
You meant to leave Mark behind
in the game to get back at her.

00:10:35.130 --> 00:10:36.410
This has nothing to do with you.

00:10:36.470 --> 00:10:37.470
It does.

00:10:37.830 --> 00:10:39.200
Mark is our friend.

00:10:40.150 --> 00:10:41.150
“Friend”?

00:10:43.850 --> 00:10:45.650
Why don’t you tell these kids

00:10:46.930 --> 00:10:48.300
how meaningless

00:10:50.170 --> 00:10:51.980
something such as “friends” truly is?

00:10:53.040 --> 00:10:54.360
You had no trouble leaving behind

00:10:54.880 --> 00:10:57.000
the best friend who sacrificed
herself to save you,

00:10:57.550 --> 00:11:00.050
without ever thinking about rescuing her.

00:11:00.480 --> 00:11:01.480
Am I right?

00:11:01.810 --> 00:11:02.810
That’s not true, Aom.

00:11:04.010 --> 00:11:05.610
I never meant to leave you behind.

00:11:05.620 --> 00:11:07.200
You can say anything now.

00:11:08.790 --> 00:11:09.950
But you will never understand

00:11:10.820 --> 00:11:14.460
how tormenting it feels
to be left behind all alone.

00:11:16.090 --> 00:11:19.810
Yet I believed that you would
come back for me.

00:11:20.610 --> 00:11:22.500
I believed you would never leave me.

00:11:24.450 --> 00:11:27.900
How foolish of me to believe those words.

00:11:28.550 --> 00:11:29.550
Aom.

00:11:30.040 --> 00:11:31.600
I can understand your anger.

00:11:32.500 --> 00:11:33.956
But Mark has nothing to do with this.

00:11:33.980 --> 00:11:35.980
Well, my parents had nothing
to do with it, either!

00:11:37.490 --> 00:11:41.340
Do you even know what I’ve been through
since I got out of the game?

00:11:44.160 --> 00:11:46.500
I am now in a world
that’s been changed by 30 years.

00:11:47.330 --> 00:11:49.010
It’s a world I don’t know anything about!

00:11:50.320 --> 00:11:51.320
I’m sorry.

00:11:52.480 --> 00:11:53.480
Meanwhile you,

00:11:54.590 --> 00:11:56.200
my most beloved best friend,

00:11:57.920 --> 00:11:59.750
are living your happiest life.

00:12:00.920 --> 00:12:02.700
You have an adorable son.

00:12:04.920 --> 00:12:06.600
Free of pain.

00:12:08.060 --> 00:12:09.850
“Free of pain,” you said?

00:12:28.690 --> 00:12:29.690
Yes.

00:12:30.330 --> 00:12:32.200
Your sacrifice that day

00:12:34.510 --> 00:12:35.820
saved everyone’s lives.

00:12:36.910 --> 00:12:39.500
But it doesn’t mean no one lost anything.

00:12:41.100 --> 00:12:45.600
I lost one leg, disabled for life.

00:12:48.810 --> 00:12:51.400
The rest of our friends lived
with the nightmares of the game.

00:12:52.240 --> 00:12:56.700
It wasn’t true that I didn’t think
about saving you.

00:12:57.270 --> 00:12:59.350
I always wanted to go and save you, Aom.

00:13:02.840 --> 00:13:03.990
I’m sorry.

00:13:04.610 --> 00:13:06.000
You got to the hospital too late.

00:13:07.030 --> 00:13:09.720
Your wounds were deadly
infectious down to the bone

00:13:10.280 --> 00:13:13.600
I had no choice but to amputate
your leg to save your life.

00:13:14.250 --> 00:13:15.430
I’m really sorry.

00:13:16.030 --> 00:13:18.800
Doctor, when can I go home?

00:13:24.210 --> 00:13:25.600
I promised my friend something.

00:13:25.950 --> 00:13:27.350
I need to save her.

00:13:36.850 --> 00:13:37.850
Manus?

00:13:39.130 --> 00:13:41.296
The doctor said I have to stay put
for the next few weeks.

00:13:41.320 --> 00:13:43.250
Will you and everyone go and save Aom?

00:13:43.640 --> 00:13:45.540
If we wait any longer, I’m afraid
Aom might be in danger.

00:13:45.560 --> 00:13:46.560
Pan.

00:13:49.230 --> 00:13:50.760
I’m not playing that game anymore.

00:13:54.100 --> 00:13:56.596
I can barely bring myself to think about
what happened that day.

00:13:56.620 --> 00:14:00.000
Manus, did you forget who saved us?

00:14:00.480 --> 00:14:03.150
Aom is waiting for us to come
and save her right now.

00:14:03.350 --> 00:14:04.350
Aom is dead.

00:14:05.820 --> 00:14:08.850
Do you really think she’d survive that?

00:14:09.630 --> 00:14:10.630
Coward.

00:14:10.990 --> 00:14:12.300
You’re a coward!

00:14:15.430 --> 00:14:18.410
If you’re not going to do it,
give me the dice.

00:14:18.660 --> 00:14:20.100
I’ll go and save her myself!

00:14:23.420 --> 00:14:24.460
The dice is gone.

00:14:26.270 --> 00:14:27.270
What?

00:14:28.580 --> 00:14:32.100
I’m here today to tell you I quit school.

00:14:33.050 --> 00:14:34.690
I don’t think we’ll see each other again.

00:14:36.040 --> 00:14:37.040
Hang on.

00:14:37.120 --> 00:14:38.810
Friends don’t do this!

00:14:39.590 --> 00:14:40.820
Manus, wait!

00:14:52.780 --> 00:14:55.350
I’ve always carried with me
the guilt of what happened to you.

00:15:02.450 --> 00:15:05.250
But I really didn’t know
how I’d come and find you.

00:15:06.260 --> 00:15:07.320
Hello. Hello.

00:15:07.690 --> 00:15:08.690
Please.

00:15:08.940 --> 00:15:11.150
This is my missing daughter.

00:15:11.360 --> 00:15:12.900
The best thing I could do…

00:15:13.680 --> 00:15:16.490
MISSING

00:15:16.770 --> 00:15:18.100
Excuse me.

00:15:20.830 --> 00:15:22.020
Please. Excuse me.

00:15:22.520 --> 00:15:24.350
Was to take care of your mother.

00:15:33.130 --> 00:15:34.130
Pan?

00:15:34.720 --> 00:15:35.720
Let me help.

00:15:38.900 --> 00:15:40.350
Please contact us if you find her.

00:15:42.330 --> 00:15:46.740
Ten years had passed, and still
no one ever saw you.

00:15:48.750 --> 00:15:52.700
Even I thought… you didn’t make it.

00:15:55.970 --> 00:15:57.620
So I stopped looking for you.

00:16:01.190 --> 00:16:02.980
I changed my name.

00:16:05.110 --> 00:16:06.600
I started my life over.

00:16:11.720 --> 00:16:14.900
But I never forgot about
what happened, Aom.

00:16:23.620 --> 00:16:24.620
Aom.

00:16:27.170 --> 00:16:28.700
I’m only asking you for one thing…

00:16:31.980 --> 00:16:33.400
Please, give me the dice.

00:16:35.330 --> 00:16:36.650
I just want to save my son.

00:16:38.700 --> 00:16:40.200
I’ll beg if you want me to.

00:16:42.210 --> 00:16:43.210
Pan, stop.

00:16:43.580 --> 00:16:44.580
Careful, ma’am.

00:16:45.170 --> 00:16:46.170
Please.

00:16:50.600 --> 00:16:53.050
Do you really think Mark is still alive?

00:16:54.030 --> 00:16:57.000
Maybe he… didn’t make it.

00:16:58.330 --> 00:17:00.600
You know how vicious this game can be.

00:17:01.270 --> 00:17:02.270
Mark…

00:17:03.130 --> 00:17:04.130
Ma’am.

00:17:04.660 --> 00:17:06.260
Ma’am, please don’t overthink right now.

00:17:06.370 --> 00:17:07.850
Aom made it out alive.

00:17:08.670 --> 00:17:10.510
There’s a chance
that Mark is still alive, too.

00:17:10.740 --> 00:17:12.056
We have no proof to the contrary.

00:17:12.080 --> 00:17:13.080
There’s still hope.

00:17:15.140 --> 00:17:16.620
If you want it so much, just take it.

00:17:19.860 --> 00:17:20.860
Take it.

00:17:22.860 --> 00:17:23.860
Aom.

00:17:30.770 --> 00:17:34.100
Are you saying Aom is the student
who disappeared 30 years ago?

00:17:36.360 --> 00:17:38.500
I think I understand how she feels.

00:17:39.300 --> 00:17:41.540
Going through anything like that
would make anyone angry.

00:17:41.580 --> 00:17:43.450
I don’t care how angry she is.

00:17:43.800 --> 00:17:45.500
Mark didn’t deserve any of this.

00:17:47.930 --> 00:17:50.290
How are we going to save Mark?

00:17:50.610 --> 00:17:52.300
Mark’s mom wants to do it right away,

00:17:52.670 --> 00:17:54.590
but I told her I needed to talk
to you all first.

00:17:54.940 --> 00:17:58.300
The chances of rescuing him are
higher with more people.

00:17:59.250 --> 00:18:01.770
So I’m asking you if you want
to help me save Mark.

00:18:01.910 --> 00:18:02.910
I’m all in.

00:18:03.860 --> 00:18:06.900
I want to save him,
but to tell you the truth,

00:18:07.690 --> 00:18:09.400
this game really scares me.

00:18:09.780 --> 00:18:10.780
I understand.

00:18:12.010 --> 00:18:13.690
It’s undeniable how dangerous the game is.

00:18:14.210 --> 00:18:16.650
There’s a chance some of us
might not make it out of the game.

00:18:22.330 --> 00:18:23.530
But I feel like I am to blame.

00:18:26.130 --> 00:18:30.950
I’m to blame for getting you involved in
the game to satisfy my own needs.

00:18:32.330 --> 00:18:35.750
So I feel that I owe it to Mark
to go and rescue him.

00:18:37.480 --> 00:18:38.500
I feel the same way.

00:18:39.760 --> 00:18:41.950
I asked Mark to play the last game.

00:18:42.680 --> 00:18:45.900
So I should… take responsibility, too.

00:18:46.920 --> 00:18:48.100
If you all think so…

00:18:50.090 --> 00:18:51.090
Count me in.

00:18:51.480 --> 00:18:52.480
What about the others?

00:18:53.560 --> 00:18:55.360
I think it’s safe to say
Aom isn’t interested.

00:18:55.640 --> 00:18:57.010
As for Benz and Don,

00:18:57.350 --> 00:18:58.700
I texted them about this.

00:18:59.200 --> 00:19:01.400
I don’t know what they want to do, though.

00:19:02.560 --> 00:19:05.850
MAMAY: WE’RE GOING TO RESCUE MARK.
ARE YOU AND DON IN?

00:19:09.970 --> 00:19:13.400
Hey, so it’s true that Mark went missing?

00:19:13.820 --> 00:19:15.200
I saw his mom at school.

00:19:15.720 --> 00:19:17.700
Yeah. I feel sorry for him.

00:19:18.300 --> 00:19:20.400
Mark is so nice and kind, isn’t he?

00:19:20.760 --> 00:19:22.560
He even taught me
how to play basketball once.

00:19:30.980 --> 00:19:31.980
What’s wrong?

00:19:33.620 --> 00:19:35.100
Mamay texted me.

00:19:35.850 --> 00:19:37.010
They’re going to rescue Mark.

00:19:37.550 --> 00:19:39.400
Don’t you think we should help?

00:19:42.610 --> 00:19:43.860
What the hell for?

00:19:45.070 --> 00:19:46.550
Mark got left behind by Aom.

00:19:47.240 --> 00:19:48.400
It had nothing to do with us.

00:19:48.450 --> 00:19:51.020
Did you forget we played a part?

00:19:52.810 --> 00:19:54.140
Benz, what the hell did you do?

00:19:57.220 --> 00:19:58.700
If he actually died in there,

00:19:59.280 --> 00:20:00.600
doesn’t that make us murderers?

00:20:03.060 --> 00:20:05.300
I think we need to save him.

00:20:05.810 --> 00:20:07.500
Don’t try to be a hero, you fool.

00:20:08.100 --> 00:20:09.810
What’s in it for us if we help?

00:20:18.720 --> 00:20:20.770
DON’T FORGET ABOUT YOUR DUE DATE.

00:20:23.660 --> 00:20:25.500
I’ll go back into that game like you ask.

00:20:26.020 --> 00:20:27.020
You will?

00:20:27.680 --> 00:20:28.760
Damn it!

00:20:28.810 --> 00:20:30.340
Now that’s my best friend right there!

00:20:30.990 --> 00:20:31.990
Amazing.

00:20:32.310 --> 00:20:33.700
I’ll tell Mamay.

00:20:46.170 --> 00:20:48.500
Pan isn’t coming today, dear?

00:20:49.840 --> 00:20:53.250
You and Pan are always inseparable.

00:20:54.340 --> 00:20:55.550
She’s busy today.

00:20:57.730 --> 00:21:01.100
You know, when you were away,

00:21:01.660 --> 00:21:03.700
Pan always came around to see you, Aom.

00:21:05.310 --> 00:21:07.900
She kept me company all the time.

00:21:08.270 --> 00:21:09.550
Don’t worry, Mom.

00:21:11.610 --> 00:21:13.150
I’m here with you now.

00:21:17.640 --> 00:21:18.700
Let’s eat, shall we?

00:21:25.130 --> 00:21:26.200
I’ll get it.

00:21:34.590 --> 00:21:35.600
What do you want?

00:21:36.800 --> 00:21:39.000
We’re going to play the game again
to save Mark tonight.

00:21:39.560 --> 00:21:40.560
So?

00:21:41.140 --> 00:21:43.000
Are you demanding I lend a hand?

00:21:44.180 --> 00:21:45.180
No.

00:21:48.710 --> 00:21:50.300
Mark’s mom wanted me to give you this.

00:21:53.650 --> 00:21:56.300
She said you probably wouldn’t accept it
if she came here herself.

00:21:59.300 --> 00:22:00.300
I understand you.

00:22:01.900 --> 00:22:04.580
Anyone would be right to be angry
if they went through what you did.

00:22:05.500 --> 00:22:08.820
I just don’t think revenge is the answer.

00:22:10.970 --> 00:22:11.970
Of course, it is.

00:22:13.560 --> 00:22:16.010
Then how come you don’t look
one bit happy with it?

00:22:18.430 --> 00:22:19.430
Aom.

00:22:19.930 --> 00:22:22.100
I don’t know what you
should do about this.

00:22:24.050 --> 00:22:25.050
But I believe in you.

00:22:26.230 --> 00:22:28.110
I believe that you will make
the right decision.

00:22:48.720 --> 00:22:49.720
Pan.

00:22:50.160 --> 00:22:53.900
Do you think this game can really
grant wishes like it promises?

00:22:55.930 --> 00:22:56.930
I don’t know.

00:22:57.260 --> 00:22:59.500
We have to collect four medals
before we find out, right?

00:23:00.430 --> 00:23:03.100
But if it really does grant wishes,
what are you asking for?

00:23:04.330 --> 00:23:05.330
I don’t know.

00:23:06.360 --> 00:23:08.010
Maybe I’ll ask for a Walkman.

00:23:08.910 --> 00:23:09.910
What?

00:23:10.070 --> 00:23:10.860
That’s it?

00:23:11.030 --> 00:23:13.500
Well, that’s all I want!

00:23:14.520 --> 00:23:16.200
And you? What are you wishing for?

00:23:16.730 --> 00:23:17.890
Hmm…

00:23:20.770 --> 00:23:22.300
I’ll probably ask for some money.

00:23:23.220 --> 00:23:25.130
My family is kind of struggling right now.

00:23:25.510 --> 00:23:28.430
If I could ask for some money to help
my parents out, that would be great.

00:23:30.720 --> 00:23:33.600
Then I’ll help you win the next game.

00:23:35.770 --> 00:23:37.600
What about your Walkman?

00:23:38.280 --> 00:23:39.280
Well…

00:23:40.210 --> 00:23:41.900
You’re my best friend.

00:23:44.950 --> 00:23:48.400
But don’t forget my Walkman
once you’re filthy rich!

00:23:50.390 --> 00:23:51.390
How about this?

00:23:51.680 --> 00:23:53.350
Let’s go and pick one out this evening.

00:23:53.750 --> 00:23:55.710
I’ll take that as a promise,
and I’ll remember it.

00:23:56.050 --> 00:23:57.050
Promise?

00:23:57.610 --> 00:23:58.610
Promise.

00:23:58.970 --> 00:23:59.970
Are you sure?

00:24:00.520 --> 00:24:01.800
And I won’t forget it, either.

00:24:04.600 --> 00:24:06.090
Dearest Aom,

00:24:07.300 --> 00:24:10.800
I don’t know if I’d ever get a chance
to give you this.

00:24:12.350 --> 00:24:17.000
I’m sorry I couldn’t go back
and save you like I promised.

00:24:18.780 --> 00:24:22.530
I really do want to make good
on my promises,

00:24:24.030 --> 00:24:25.600
even if just one of them.

00:24:27.430 --> 00:24:29.400
Do you remember

00:24:30.470 --> 00:24:34.200
how I said I wanted to ask for some money
if I could have my wish granted?

00:24:36.840 --> 00:24:40.300
I know now that it’s not money I want.

00:24:41.760 --> 00:24:44.300
If I really could make a wish,

00:24:45.390 --> 00:24:46.800
it would be…

00:24:47.960 --> 00:24:51.000
to be with you forever.

00:24:52.680 --> 00:24:58.410
PANYADA

00:25:15.870 --> 00:25:16.870
Hey.

00:25:17.210 --> 00:25:18.800
Is Auntie seriously going to play?

00:25:19.660 --> 00:25:20.800
She can barely walk.

00:25:21.040 --> 00:25:22.360
Is she gonna make it in the game?

00:25:24.530 --> 00:25:26.050
We’re all here.

00:25:26.770 --> 00:25:28.200
Let’s just roll the dice.

00:25:35.680 --> 00:25:36.680
Are you ready?

00:25:45.690 --> 00:25:46.690
Hold on.

00:25:50.510 --> 00:25:51.050
Aom.

00:25:51.490 --> 00:25:52.500
What are you doing here?

00:25:53.440 --> 00:25:54.700
I’m joining the game.

00:25:55.080 --> 00:25:56.770
Don’t think this means I’ve forgiven you.

00:25:58.590 --> 00:25:59.590
Are you sure about this?

00:26:01.300 --> 00:26:02.600
I’ve made my decision.

00:26:04.130 --> 00:26:05.200
You should wait outside.

00:26:07.380 --> 00:26:08.380
Thanks.

00:26:08.880 --> 00:26:09.760
I’m really sorry...

00:26:09.800 --> 00:26:11.850
Save your apology for after the game.

00:26:25.090 --> 00:26:26.340
I knew you’d come.

00:26:29.600 --> 00:26:30.600
Just roll the dice.

00:26:30.840 --> 00:26:32.050
Let’s get this over with.

00:26:57.990 --> 00:26:59.050
Mark isn’t here.

00:27:01.940 --> 00:27:02.940
Aom.

00:27:03.200 --> 00:27:05.400
Do you happen to know
where Mark could be?

00:27:05.630 --> 00:27:06.630
I don’t.

00:27:07.860 --> 00:27:09.100
The game is always changing.

00:27:12.530 --> 00:27:17.400
Welcome, all eight players,
to Djehuty, the game of wits,

00:27:17.700 --> 00:27:20.100
where all your desires will come true.

00:27:26.840 --> 00:27:28.230
We have no choice.

00:27:28.700 --> 00:27:30.020
Let’s just play the game for now.

00:28:00.500 --> 00:28:02.900
Players, get changed and
ready for the game.

00:28:25.080 --> 00:28:26.250
There’s nothing around here.

00:28:26.410 --> 00:28:27.410
No sign of Mark, either.

00:28:27.560 --> 00:28:28.600
Nothing over here as well.

00:28:29.590 --> 00:28:30.590
Guys.

00:28:32.900 --> 00:28:34.660
Is the venue for this game
an amusement park?

00:28:35.370 --> 00:28:37.200
Do you really think Mark is here?

00:28:41.910 --> 00:28:43.050
Four stars?

00:28:44.170 --> 00:28:46.296
This game must be more difficult
than all the previous games.

00:28:46.320 --> 00:28:48.250
Escape Out.

00:28:49.000 --> 00:28:54.300
All players are assigned as inmates
trying to escape from this amusement park.

00:28:54.470 --> 00:28:58.580
Players must find keys and
gates to make an exit.

00:28:58.780 --> 00:29:02.500
One key opens one gate.

00:29:02.970 --> 00:29:08.600
Inmates must evade the Soul Keepers
whose job is to apprehend inmates.

00:29:09.130 --> 00:29:14.500
If apprehended by Soul Keepers,
captives will be taken to the Test Center.

00:29:14.670 --> 00:29:17.700
In case of more than one captive
being apprehended,

00:29:17.830 --> 00:29:21.660
the captives will be put through
a Psychological Test.

00:29:22.200 --> 00:29:28.100
If failed, the captive’s soul
will be confined.

00:29:28.320 --> 00:29:29.620
Our soul will be confined?

00:29:29.690 --> 00:29:31.260
The game completes

00:29:31.280 --> 00:29:34.500
when inmates make a successful
escape within the time limit.

00:29:34.800 --> 00:29:37.800
There is currently one captive.

00:29:38.570 --> 00:29:39.570
Mark!

00:29:40.670 --> 00:29:42.100
It’s really him!

00:29:42.350 --> 00:29:44.600
Guys, we need to hurry up and save him.

00:29:46.850 --> 00:29:49.540
Even if we can save him,
we still can’t leave this place.

00:29:49.990 --> 00:29:51.850
We need to find the keys
and the exits first.

00:29:56.600 --> 00:29:57.150
Guys.

00:29:57.350 --> 00:29:59.070
I think you need to
take a look at this map.

00:30:05.010 --> 00:30:06.700
Is this the park’s directory?

00:30:08.310 --> 00:30:09.650
It seems there are seven zones.

00:30:10.220 --> 00:30:11.220
Seven?

00:30:11.560 --> 00:30:13.360
That’s gonna take us forever
to find the keys.

00:30:13.430 --> 00:30:15.390
It’s likely that the keys
are hidden in each zone.

00:30:16.030 --> 00:30:17.200
This is the closest one.

00:30:17.870 --> 00:30:19.050
Let’s start here.

00:30:35.310 --> 00:30:37.100
Are the keys really hidden here?

00:30:39.630 --> 00:30:40.750
Let’s split up.

00:30:51.070 --> 00:30:51.640
Guys.

00:30:51.940 --> 00:30:53.000
Come take a look at this.

00:30:55.340 --> 00:30:57.100
I think the key might be in here.

00:30:58.780 --> 00:30:59.780
It needs a code.

00:31:00.880 --> 00:31:02.170
How are we gonna find that?

00:31:02.770 --> 00:31:04.320
There’s a sign over there.

00:31:05.280 --> 00:31:06.500
It’s got something on it.

00:31:12.910 --> 00:31:14.700
I think it’s the clues to the code.

00:31:15.930 --> 00:31:17.900
These are different kinds of dinosaurs,

00:31:21.050 --> 00:31:23.290
and they happen to coordinate
with the ones in this room.

00:31:23.400 --> 00:31:26.300
I think this is a puzzle for us to decode.

00:31:33.890 --> 00:31:34.890
They’re degrees.

00:31:36.580 --> 00:31:37.580
What do you mean?

00:31:39.140 --> 00:31:41.740
Each dinosaur faces
in different directions.

00:31:42.430 --> 00:31:44.800
I think it’s the degrees in which
the dinosaurs are facing.

00:31:45.400 --> 00:31:48.390
How are we to know which direction
is which degrees?

00:31:52.790 --> 00:31:54.400
I got this with my uniform.

00:31:55.060 --> 00:31:57.300
We have to find the direction
each dinosaur is facing in,

00:31:57.810 --> 00:32:00.350
and replace the picture of
the dinosaurs with the numbers.

00:32:01.190 --> 00:32:02.900
North likely indicates 360 degrees.

00:32:11.360 --> 00:32:13.300
This one is facing east,

00:32:13.740 --> 00:32:14.740
which is 90 degrees.

00:32:16.360 --> 00:32:17.800
I’ll check out the one over there.

00:32:23.040 --> 00:32:24.040
It’s north.

00:32:24.910 --> 00:32:27.000
Guys, I don’t know
which direction this is.

00:32:27.120 --> 00:32:28.120
What’s ‘W’ mean?

00:32:30.190 --> 00:32:31.450
It’s northeast over here.

00:32:33.145 --> 00:32:34.145
This one faces south.

00:32:35.619 --> 00:32:37.001
It’s north.

00:32:37.290 --> 00:32:38.610
Now that we have all the numbers,

00:32:39.068 --> 00:32:40.398
what do we do with them?

00:32:40.884 --> 00:32:42.302
This symbol indicates fraction.

00:32:42.850 --> 00:32:44.543
This one faces north, so it’s 360.

00:32:44.830 --> 00:32:47.200
Divided by the one facing south,
which is 180.

00:32:47.500 --> 00:32:48.500
That makes two.

00:32:48.994 --> 00:32:51.111
This is 270 divided by 90.

00:32:51.162 --> 00:32:52.162
Now we have three.

00:32:52.300 --> 00:32:55.202
This is 360 divided by 45…

00:32:58.480 --> 00:32:59.552
The code is 238.

00:33:18.410 --> 00:33:20.496
Should we go straight to the next zone?

00:33:21.028 --> 00:33:22.028
Hold on.

00:33:22.718 --> 00:33:24.162
I think the items we received
from the game

00:33:24.182 --> 00:33:26.700
must be helpful in puzzle-solving.

00:33:27.699 --> 00:33:29.002
Did you all receive something?

00:33:29.099 --> 00:33:30.099
I did.

00:33:34.604 --> 00:33:35.900
I got a whistle.

00:33:41.240 --> 00:33:43.637
Are these things really useful?

00:33:44.130 --> 00:33:46.202
They seem… shoddy.

00:33:47.480 --> 00:33:49.160
They’re definitely going to come in handy.

00:33:50.434 --> 00:33:53.254
I think each zone requires
different items.

00:33:53.989 --> 00:33:55.801
Should we split up, then?

00:33:56.360 --> 00:34:00.001
Kaen, Pie, and I will go to
the zones on the right.

00:34:00.428 --> 00:34:02.250
You guys go to the zones on the left.

00:34:02.804 --> 00:34:04.896
Send us a signal when you get the keys.

00:34:14.201 --> 00:34:15.296
I want you to keep it.

00:34:20.542 --> 00:34:21.542
Let’s go, bud.

00:34:24.350 --> 00:34:26.019
Why did you give Mamay the key?

00:34:26.287 --> 00:34:27.767
Don’t you think she could betray you?

00:34:30.358 --> 00:34:32.198
Mamay came here to save Mark.

00:34:33.520 --> 00:34:35.151
She has no reason to betray me.

00:34:36.070 --> 00:34:37.395
Do you really believe that

00:34:38.090 --> 00:34:39.820
everyone is here to save Mark?

00:34:42.850 --> 00:34:47.780
I understand you find it hard to trust
after everything that happened to you.

00:34:48.746 --> 00:34:51.200
But I want you to give it another try.

00:34:53.042 --> 00:34:54.402
At least try to trust me.

00:34:56.754 --> 00:34:59.400
I promise I won’t betray you,

00:35:00.120 --> 00:35:02.097
and I won’t abandon you like before.

00:35:06.045 --> 00:35:07.045
I’m sorry.

00:35:08.943 --> 00:35:10.595
I can’t trust anyone anymore.

00:35:21.340 --> 00:35:21.900
I think…

00:35:22.010 --> 00:35:23.152
The key is in there.

00:35:24.325 --> 00:35:25.325
Let’s go.

00:35:29.750 --> 00:35:30.990
Let’s split up and look for it.

00:35:40.751 --> 00:35:41.997
Hey! Found it!

00:35:42.477 --> 00:35:43.477
Y’all!

00:35:48.362 --> 00:35:50.001
Another code?

00:35:51.131 --> 00:35:52.331
It’s a 4-digit code this time.

00:36:00.570 --> 00:36:02.330
I think it has something
to do with this box.

00:36:12.590 --> 00:36:13.590
Don.

00:36:23.480 --> 00:36:24.545
Ow, shoot!

00:36:29.817 --> 00:36:31.099
There’s something on the screen.

00:36:31.970 --> 00:36:32.970
Is it the code?

00:36:34.000 --> 00:36:35.000
I doubt it.

00:36:53.610 --> 00:36:55.010
Did something appear on the screen?

00:36:55.623 --> 00:36:56.903
There’s an ‘O’.

00:36:58.788 --> 00:37:00.496
Now an ‘X’ just appeared right after.

00:37:03.637 --> 00:37:04.198
Let me see.

00:37:04.376 --> 00:37:05.496
It’s gone.

00:37:05.810 --> 00:37:07.330
I swear it was on the screen just now.

00:37:10.080 --> 00:37:11.080
Benz.

00:37:11.490 --> 00:37:13.050
Can you sit on the horse in the middle?

00:37:14.100 --> 00:37:15.669
You’re asking me to play this carousel?

00:37:18.594 --> 00:37:19.888
Fine.

00:37:26.062 --> 00:37:27.062
Now what?

00:37:30.980 --> 00:37:32.053
It’s tic-tac-toe.

00:37:34.600 --> 00:37:35.600
Don.

00:37:36.080 --> 00:37:37.320
Sit on the horse at the corner.

00:37:42.048 --> 00:37:44.201
What? I totally didn’t have to
actually sit on it!

00:37:53.720 --> 00:37:54.720
Aom.

00:38:06.190 --> 00:38:07.190
Seven?

00:38:09.380 --> 00:38:10.986
There are three other carriages
like this one.

00:38:11.010 --> 00:38:12.820
We need to play tic-tac-toe
for four numbers.

00:38:14.090 --> 00:38:15.290
Let’s play the next one, then.

00:38:51.031 --> 00:38:52.152
They’re Roman numerals.

00:38:52.428 --> 00:38:53.797
From one to 12.

00:38:54.102 --> 00:38:55.900
What are they for?

00:39:00.650 --> 00:39:03.896
I think this clock will help us
solve the puzzle.

00:39:06.880 --> 00:39:07.880
Look.

00:39:26.136 --> 00:39:27.397
This tells time.

00:39:28.146 --> 00:39:30.026
We must coordinate it to
the hands of the clock.

00:39:31.700 --> 00:39:33.048
Mamay, you go to number three.

00:39:33.470 --> 00:39:34.551
I’ll go to 12.

00:39:35.602 --> 00:39:36.602
Okay.

00:39:40.930 --> 00:39:42.198
Mamay, press the button.

00:39:47.057 --> 00:39:48.302
Mamay. Kaen.

00:39:48.700 --> 00:39:50.057
The numbers changed.

00:39:50.333 --> 00:39:53.200
It says 19.55 now.

00:39:56.400 --> 00:39:57.400
That’s seven and 11.

00:40:11.197 --> 00:40:13.102
Kaen, the clock just went dark.

00:40:16.096 --> 00:40:16.804
Why?

00:40:17.010 --> 00:40:19.410
Did we get something wrong?

00:40:23.305 --> 00:40:24.305
We didn’t.

00:40:24.880 --> 00:40:26.880
Now there are only four numbers
with the lights on.

00:40:30.318 --> 00:40:31.398
That’s our code.

00:40:42.640 --> 00:40:44.440
The game is easier than
I thought it would be.

00:40:44.540 --> 00:40:45.050
I agree.

00:40:45.379 --> 00:40:46.379
Don’t underestimate it.

00:40:46.640 --> 00:40:48.680
You seriously can’t be too cautious
about this game.

00:40:58.765 --> 00:40:59.299
Oh?

00:40:59.390 --> 00:41:00.500
There’s a parade.

00:41:04.220 --> 00:41:05.220
Adorable.

00:41:22.910 --> 00:41:23.910
Benz, watch out!

00:41:25.005 --> 00:41:26.005
Benz!

00:41:27.460 --> 00:41:28.460
What the hell did you do?

00:41:33.862 --> 00:41:35.782
These must be the Keepers
the game told us about.

00:41:46.950 --> 00:41:48.355
They’re following
the sound of the whistle.

00:41:48.379 --> 00:41:48.900
Aom.

00:41:49.207 --> 00:41:50.400
Go and warn Mamay’s group.

00:41:55.656 --> 00:41:56.134
Don.

00:41:56.256 --> 00:41:57.256
Hurry.

00:41:57.331 --> 00:41:58.331
Let’s go.

00:41:59.096 --> 00:42:00.096
Come on.

00:42:00.937 --> 00:42:01.937
Let’s go.

00:42:05.040 --> 00:42:06.303
Run! They’re the Keepers!

00:42:09.914 --> 00:42:10.454
Aom?

00:42:10.910 --> 00:42:11.496
Run!

00:42:11.748 --> 00:42:12.499
Run away!

00:42:12.725 --> 00:42:13.725
Run!

00:42:31.368 --> 00:42:32.368
Samut!

00:42:35.057 --> 00:42:36.057
Where’s Aom?

00:42:41.469 --> 00:42:42.469
Aom.

00:42:45.296 --> 00:42:46.296
You take care of Benz.

00:42:46.457 --> 00:42:47.457
I’ll go and save Aom.

00:43:13.447 --> 00:43:14.447
Mark!

00:43:14.555 --> 00:43:18.050
There are currently two captives.

00:43:18.080 --> 00:43:19.080
Aom.

00:43:23.370 --> 00:43:24.370
Aom.

00:43:27.216 --> 00:43:28.216
Mark?

00:43:28.400 --> 00:43:29.601
How did you get here?

00:43:36.625 --> 00:43:38.598
The Psychological Test will now begin.

00:43:47.730 --> 00:43:48.930
What the hell is going on now?

00:44:00.877 --> 00:44:01.877
Mark?

00:44:04.512 --> 00:44:05.512
Mark!

00:44:10.402 --> 00:44:11.402
Mark!

00:44:12.660 --> 00:44:13.660
Mark!

00:44:27.011 --> 00:44:28.702
The Psychological Test will now begin.

00:44:28.760 --> 00:44:29.760
Mark!

00:44:30.565 --> 00:44:32.346
His heart is still beating,
but he’s not responsive.

00:44:32.370 --> 00:44:33.995
What exactly happened in there?

00:44:34.557 --> 00:44:36.374
There is no place for you out there.

00:44:36.394 --> 00:44:37.430
It’d be better if you stay here, Aom.

00:44:37.454 --> 00:44:38.454
Stay forever.

00:44:40.671 --> 00:44:41.697
What more now?

00:44:42.715 --> 00:44:44.300
These must be the exits.

00:44:44.802 --> 00:44:46.423
One door for one player?

00:44:46.762 --> 00:44:49.016
Does that mean someone
must stay behind?
