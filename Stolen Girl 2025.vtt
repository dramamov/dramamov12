WEBVTT

00:02:23.534 --> 00:02:27.712
Hey, sweetie.
Come here right now.

00:02:29.671 --> 00:02:33.544
- So fancy for breakfast.
- Amina, breakfast!

00:02:34.632 --> 00:02:36.895
Grandpa!

00:02:46.209 --> 00:02:49.343
- Hey. Morning, dad.
- ...the rain...

00:02:50.996 --> 00:02:56.437
Let me be your whiskey.
Kill the pain.

00:02:56.480 --> 00:02:59.222
Thank you.

00:02:59.266 --> 00:03:01.746
- Oh, be careful.
- Yeah, yeah.

00:03:03.226 --> 00:03:05.794
Oh, you reunited with your best
friend.

00:03:06.925 --> 00:03:12.757
Oh... If she sets her mind
in something... Reminds me someone I know.

00:03:14.281 --> 00:03:17.327
I don't know who that is.

00:03:17.371 --> 00:03:19.024
Adorable.

00:03:19.068 --> 00:03:20.852
Mina, do you want orange juice?

00:03:20.896 --> 00:03:22.724
Daddy!

00:03:25.117 --> 00:03:28.033
- I thought he was coming tomorrow.
- What date is it?

00:03:30.166 --> 00:03:31.863
Jesus, it's the 23rd.

00:03:32.255 --> 00:03:34.126
Shit!

00:03:39.436 --> 00:03:41.830
So, I conveniently
forgot, sue me.

00:03:42.874 --> 00:03:45.225
You can't stop her seeing
her father.

00:03:48.663 --> 00:03:51.361
- You're taking his side now?
- It's not about sides.

00:03:51.448 --> 00:03:53.798
Your daughter deserves
to know her daddy.

00:03:56.497 --> 00:03:58.238
You know you loved each other
once.

00:03:59.456 --> 00:04:01.284
Yeah, I wasn't the one
who ruined it.

00:04:01.328 --> 00:04:04.722
He was working late hours,
doing God knows what with who.

00:04:06.028 --> 00:04:07.812
I know.

00:04:10.641 --> 00:04:13.035
Come here right now.

00:04:31.140 --> 00:04:34.404
There's daddy. Okay, all right.

00:04:35.840 --> 00:04:36.972
Daddy!

00:04:37.015 --> 00:04:39.235
Hello, puppy.

00:04:48.810 --> 00:04:51.378
10:00 am, as promised.

00:04:51.421 --> 00:04:54.859
- I'll bring her back at 6:00.
- Okay. Bye, baby.

00:04:59.386 --> 00:05:02.998
Are you okay?
You seem a little distracted.

00:05:03.041 --> 00:05:07.002
Uhm... Yeah, yeah, I'm fine.
Just work stuff.

00:05:07.089 --> 00:05:08.308
I'm good.

00:05:09.178 --> 00:05:10.310
Okay.

00:05:14.618 --> 00:05:16.316
Watch your hands, Amina.

00:05:25.760 --> 00:05:28.328
Hey, what you got there?

00:05:29.416 --> 00:05:31.200
What's this?

00:05:36.901 --> 00:05:40.514
Should we have a story?
You want a story? Yeah.

00:05:47.825 --> 00:05:50.262
Riky and Raky's adventure
began at the zoo.

00:05:50.306 --> 00:05:52.656
Dinosaurs live in the
zoo!

00:05:52.700 --> 00:05:55.398
- In our story, they do.
- Yes!

00:06:13.242 --> 00:06:15.940
- Do you like your new costume?
- Yes, Mama!

00:06:15.984 --> 00:06:17.638
Yes!

00:06:17.681 --> 00:06:20.336
Now, what are we missing?

00:06:20.380 --> 00:06:22.991
Drugs! For papa, of
course.

00:06:25.602 --> 00:06:26.857
That's not what we pay.

00:06:26.881 --> 00:06:28.320
But it is what your father's
medication costs.

00:06:28.344 --> 00:06:30.434
That may be.
But I've never paid that before.

00:06:30.458 --> 00:06:31.658
I have all the records here.

00:06:34.568 --> 00:06:37.179
Today's special discount,...

00:06:37.222 --> 00:06:41.705
...customers can get 20% off,
please take your coupon to the checkout.

00:06:42.967 --> 00:06:45.666
- Can I just see the manager?
- I am the manager, Ma'am.

00:06:45.709 --> 00:06:47.798
What happened to Frank?

00:06:47.885 --> 00:06:50.975
He retired last week.
Moved to Boca with his family.

00:06:52.020 --> 00:06:53.978
- Just give me a minute.
- Yeah.

00:07:08.732 --> 00:07:11.909
Oh! Okay, I think I see what's
going on.

00:07:11.953 --> 00:07:15.652
You are right.
We just update some details.

00:07:18.176 --> 00:07:19.874
I'm so sorry about that, Ma'am.

00:07:19.917 --> 00:07:21.415
You can go and pay at the cashier up front.

00:07:21.439 --> 00:07:22.245
Thank you.

00:07:28.099 --> 00:07:29.492
Mina?

00:07:35.890 --> 00:07:37.500
Amina?

00:07:40.460 --> 00:07:42.026
Mina?

00:07:43.811 --> 00:07:45.377
Amina?!

00:07:47.815 --> 00:07:49.686
Mina!

00:07:51.645 --> 00:07:54.648
Has anyone seen my daughter?
She's dressed as a dinosaur...

00:07:54.691 --> 00:07:56.998
Ma'am,
I need you to step outside the store...

00:07:57.041 --> 00:08:00.175
Have you seen her? Is she here?
Fuck!

00:08:01.481 --> 00:08:05.964
Mina! Have you seen a little girl?
She's only four!

00:08:05.988 --> 00:08:07.764
Please, God, please, help me!

00:08:08.488 --> 00:08:12.883
Oh, my God!
Please!

00:08:28.551 --> 00:08:32.686
- Did you find them? Where are they?
- Give them a chance. What's going on?

00:08:36.080 --> 00:08:38.300
We're doing everything we can to
find Amina.

00:08:38.343 --> 00:08:40.215
I know Karim took her.

00:08:42.217 --> 00:08:46.700
I know he did. He was acting
real fucking weird yesterday.

00:08:48.876 --> 00:08:51.661
And then Mina told me he was talking about
me to someone on the phone.

00:08:51.705 --> 00:08:53.533
- He's threatened it before.
- He has.

00:08:53.576 --> 00:08:56.144
If that's the case, we're
struggling to understand...

00:08:56.187 --> 00:08:59.495
...why Karim didn't just keep
Amina on one of his visits.

00:08:59.539 --> 00:09:01.628
How am I supposed to know that?

00:09:01.715 --> 00:09:03.238
Can you think of anything you
may have done?

00:09:05.109 --> 00:09:07.808
- Something I may have done?
- Goddamn' it. This ain't her fault.

00:09:07.851 --> 00:09:09.505
I didn't mean that.

00:09:09.810 --> 00:09:11.899
She didn't do anything to cause this.
What the fuck is wrong with you?

00:09:16.643 --> 00:09:19.210
I think he's gonna take her
home.

00:09:21.865 --> 00:09:22.953
Home?

00:09:23.040 --> 00:09:25.652
- Syria.
- Syria.

00:09:25.695 --> 00:09:27.741
He used to talk about it all the
time.

00:09:28.829 --> 00:09:32.223
Getting a job
at a hospital near his family.

00:09:32.267 --> 00:09:34.965
We got divorced,
he tried to do it then,

00:09:35.009 --> 00:09:38.316
I had to get a restraining order,
to stop him taking her out of the country.

00:09:38.360 --> 00:09:40.318
You need to check all the
airports.

00:09:45.846 --> 00:09:47.587
What? What is it?

00:09:50.415 --> 00:09:52.896
There isn't a federal law that prevents
a parent taking their child...

00:09:52.940 --> 00:09:55.333
It's kidnapping. He's kidnapped
her.

00:09:55.377 --> 00:09:57.727
...their own child
internationally.

00:09:59.076 --> 00:10:01.992
If that's the case, I'm sorry,
there's nothing we can do.

00:10:02.036 --> 00:10:05.953
You've gotta be kidding? He can
just... He can just take her?

00:10:07.868 --> 00:10:11.045
So I just... I just...
I lose my daughter?

00:10:11.088 --> 00:10:13.308
We're following all the procedures,...

00:10:13.351 --> 00:10:16.137
...we have roadblocks in
places...

00:10:19.575 --> 00:10:21.969
What other possibilities? What?

00:10:25.668 --> 00:10:28.105
You mean like a child-snatcher?

00:10:30.238 --> 00:10:33.937
Yes, could you tell me which Ohio airport
I'd need for a flight to Syria?

00:10:33.981 --> 00:10:36.113
- Hold, please.
- Ah-ah.

00:10:43.947 --> 00:10:47.647
You can't
hide from me. I see you.

00:10:47.690 --> 00:10:49.736
- Ah!
- There she is!

00:10:49.779 --> 00:10:53.565
Flights to Syria depart from
Port Columbus via Amsterdam

00:10:53.609 --> 00:10:56.525
and rage from $750 to $1000.

00:10:57.352 --> 00:10:59.136
Okay, thank you.

00:10:59.180 --> 00:11:03.097
We went to Karim's house.
I'm afraid it was cleared out.

00:11:05.229 --> 00:11:06.666
There were just a few things left.

00:11:14.456 --> 00:11:16.414
Did you check Port Columbus
airport?

00:11:17.154 --> 00:11:19.896
We found his car in long-term
storage.

00:11:21.593 --> 00:11:25.119
We're checking flight lists,
but we now suspect he has left the country.

00:11:37.261 --> 00:11:39.873
Karim Saleh Taleb.

00:11:40.134 --> 00:11:42.440
She doesn't have
any contacts for his family.

00:11:43.311 --> 00:11:45.530
- Radiology.
- Sorry, I don't understand.

00:11:47.445 --> 00:11:49.621
He said his father lived
in Riyadh,

00:11:49.665 --> 00:11:52.015
in Saudi Arabia, but there's no
record of him being there.

00:11:56.890 --> 00:12:00.154
Look, she never went there
and they never came here!

00:12:00.197 --> 00:12:02.547
Sorry, I don't have anyone by that name.

00:12:02.591 --> 00:12:04.506
- Okay.
- I don't know.

00:12:04.549 --> 00:12:08.162
You're the lawyer, don't you have
an investigator or something?

00:12:09.903 --> 00:12:12.253
I don't like your attitude
either, pal!

00:12:14.385 --> 00:12:15.865
Oh, God...

00:13:29.199 --> 00:13:34.944
When Karim took Amina overseas,
it wasn't a crime, if you can believe that.

00:13:37.425 --> 00:13:40.080
I've been without my baby girl
for...

00:13:41.777 --> 00:13:43.518
...over two years.

00:13:45.999 --> 00:13:48.828
And every day I don't get to see
her...

00:13:50.742 --> 00:13:52.832
.it hurts like a bullet.

00:13:54.094 --> 00:13:57.575
Thanks to your incredible
generosity,...

00:13:58.794 --> 00:14:00.883
...I'm gonna get to go to
Washington.

00:14:01.318 --> 00:14:05.018
And I'm gonna knock on every
door and talk to every suit.

00:14:05.061 --> 00:14:08.195
And do everything I can
to find my baby.

00:14:08.238 --> 00:14:12.721
I won't rest until I bring her
home, where she belongs.

00:14:12.764 --> 00:14:16.856
My mum left me when I was little,
I am not walking away from my own.

00:14:35.135 --> 00:14:38.878
- I'm afraid to leave you.
- No, stop right there.

00:14:41.489 --> 00:14:45.797
You stick to your guns.
Just like I taught you. Yeah.

00:14:50.759 --> 00:14:52.892
- I love you.
- I love you.

00:15:10.387 --> 00:15:11.649
Take it.

00:15:11.693 --> 00:15:14.000
State your intent.

00:15:14.043 --> 00:15:15.958
Petition for a Senate
resolution.

00:15:16.002 --> 00:15:18.830
And the support of your
governor, then bring it back.

00:15:18.874 --> 00:15:20.441
You can't block the door, Ma'am.

00:15:20.832 --> 00:15:22.617
Excuse me, I can stand here,
it's my First Amendment right!

00:15:22.660 --> 00:15:25.228
An appointment will be sent to
you within the next six months.

00:15:25.272 --> 00:15:27.274
Six months? I think I'll wait.

00:15:27.839 --> 00:15:29.580
Ma'am...

00:15:33.410 --> 00:15:37.762
Do you speak English? I can't
read the signature on my x-ray.

00:15:38.894 --> 00:15:42.811
The majority of kidnappings in
this country are committed by parents.

00:15:42.854 --> 00:15:46.902
I think it says Karim Taleb.

00:15:46.946 --> 00:15:50.384
Last year, over 25 thousand
children

00:15:50.427 --> 00:15:54.301
were abducted by parents
and nothing is being done!

00:15:54.344 --> 00:15:55.867
There's no position here by that name.

00:15:55.911 --> 00:15:58.566
Okay. Thanks anyway.

00:16:04.398 --> 00:16:07.749
Mara Danning has returned to Washington
to action a hunger strike...

00:16:07.792 --> 00:16:10.056
...with the parent's protest
group she formed...

00:16:10.099 --> 00:16:13.494
...in the wake of the disappearance
of her daughter, four years ago.

00:17:15.686 --> 00:17:17.166
Mind if I sit?

00:17:21.083 --> 00:17:23.955
- Can I help you with something?
- No.

00:17:24.608 --> 00:17:26.306
But I might be able to
help you.

00:17:29.222 --> 00:17:32.051
Look, cowboy,
I just want to be alone, okay?

00:17:44.019 --> 00:17:46.065
I'm in the child
recovery business.

00:18:03.517 --> 00:18:04.605
You did this?

00:18:08.348 --> 00:18:09.697
Is it legal?

00:18:11.133 --> 00:18:12.743
As legal as abduction.

00:18:15.659 --> 00:18:17.270
I'm broke, so...

00:18:17.313 --> 00:18:18.706
I know.

00:18:18.749 --> 00:18:20.316
Keep that.

00:18:21.404 --> 00:18:23.711
I have a proposition
for you.

00:18:23.754 --> 00:18:25.713
Come work for me.

00:18:27.758 --> 00:18:30.500
You help me find other
people's kids.

00:18:30.587 --> 00:18:32.676
I'll help you find yours.

00:18:35.288 --> 00:18:39.118
You know, it pays pretty good
too.

00:18:42.860 --> 00:18:44.688
Call me.

00:19:02.271 --> 00:19:05.796
Mara, this is Carl. Heads up linguistics,
pretty much anything I can't do.

00:19:05.840 --> 00:19:07.624
He's my second-in-command.

00:19:07.668 --> 00:19:09.539
- I'm your only-in-command...
- Right.

00:19:10.584 --> 00:19:12.760
- Nice to meet you.
- Glad you called.

00:19:12.803 --> 00:19:14.588
It's not a yes.

00:19:15.980 --> 00:19:17.417
Okay.

00:19:18.026 --> 00:19:19.419
It's for you.

00:19:38.046 --> 00:19:40.875
Hey. This is a good thing.

00:19:40.918 --> 00:19:45.053
I have contacts all over the Middle East.
We'll find her. In time.

00:19:45.096 --> 00:19:50.101
I haven't seen my daughter in four years,
86 days, four hours...

00:19:51.059 --> 00:19:54.018
- How long has it been since you've eaten?
- Nine days.

00:19:54.628 --> 00:19:56.195
Here.

00:19:57.848 --> 00:19:59.502
I can't.

00:20:02.679 --> 00:20:05.029
We're your best
option, Mara.

00:20:21.481 --> 00:20:22.960
You alright?

00:20:23.744 --> 00:20:25.224
Here.

00:20:29.097 --> 00:20:33.362
I don't understand why you want me.
I trained as a seamstress.

00:20:33.406 --> 00:20:36.539
Well, if I can be
completely honest...

00:20:36.583 --> 00:20:38.454
...we need a woman in our team.

00:20:38.628 --> 00:20:41.109
You rouse less
suspicion in this line of work.

00:20:41.152 --> 00:20:42.241
And you're tough.

00:20:45.331 --> 00:20:47.115
That should get you
started.

00:20:49.335 --> 00:20:51.250
Enough to help with your dad's
treatments.

00:20:57.430 --> 00:20:59.910
Are you ready for your first
case? Come with me.

00:21:07.178 --> 00:21:09.485
This... This is Maya.

00:21:12.314 --> 00:21:15.448
That's her son, JD.

00:21:16.492 --> 00:21:19.889
Barely sees the father until one day
he decides:

00:21:19.913 --> 00:21:21.913
"You know what? I want my kid back".

00:21:21.932 --> 00:21:26.372
He beats her senseless and then takes
the kid back to Mexico.

00:21:27.503 --> 00:21:30.376
I need more intel.
She's holding back.

00:21:31.333 --> 00:21:33.683
Figure she's scared.

00:21:33.727 --> 00:21:38.166
Well, of course she's scared. Look at you.
You're like a goddamn sack of rocks.

00:21:42.126 --> 00:21:45.304
No one knows what this feels
like more than you, Mara.

00:21:57.664 --> 00:22:02.016
He said you could get him back.
Is it true?

00:22:03.278 --> 00:22:07.630
Please. I just want him with me.

00:22:07.674 --> 00:22:11.242
I can't sleep. I can't breathe.

00:22:12.113 --> 00:22:14.811
We will try to get him back.

00:22:14.855 --> 00:22:18.337
First, could you just tell me
a little bit about your son?

00:22:20.382 --> 00:22:24.386
He is gentle, you know.

00:22:24.430 --> 00:22:28.999
He can spend hours drawing
and...

00:22:31.306 --> 00:22:32.960
...he really likes animals.

00:22:44.928 --> 00:22:48.889
- What part do I play? - Your
job is to keep the child calm.

00:22:48.932 --> 00:22:51.065
At least until we can
hand him back to the client.

00:22:51.108 --> 00:22:53.850
You give us plausibility,
keep everything looking normal.

00:22:54.808 --> 00:22:57.245
- So I'm playing mother.
- Exactly.

00:22:57.288 --> 00:22:59.682
Let me run you through the plan,
step by step.

00:23:07.560 --> 00:23:09.910
Finding and recovering
the target is hard enough.

00:23:09.953 --> 00:23:12.391
Then you get him across
the border with fake paperwork.

00:23:12.434 --> 00:23:14.937
- How do we do that?
- This is only Mexico to Arizona.

00:23:15.461 --> 00:23:16.461
It's easy.

00:23:28.581 --> 00:23:30.452
A lot of stray dogs in
Mexico.

00:24:26.900 --> 00:24:28.292
Hey...

00:24:56.756 --> 00:24:58.975
Okay, we're on. Let's
go.

00:25:14.991 --> 00:25:16.950
Keep a lookout.

00:25:26.829 --> 00:25:28.048
Shit...

00:25:33.183 --> 00:25:34.924
We're in.

00:25:42.453 --> 00:25:45.456
Oh, oh. Hey, wait.

00:25:54.248 --> 00:25:55.989
- Shit!
- What?

00:25:57.730 --> 00:25:59.862
Class must have cancelled. Move
it.

00:26:03.866 --> 00:26:05.564
Damn! We missed our
window.

00:26:09.263 --> 00:26:10.917
Means we're going to
have to improvise.

00:26:21.754 --> 00:26:25.148
- Hey, get ready.
- We can't do it here, can we?

00:26:43.210 --> 00:26:44.777
Hey.

00:26:51.958 --> 00:26:53.699
Wanna play with her?

00:26:56.223 --> 00:26:58.399
What is that?

00:27:04.144 --> 00:27:06.929
Oh! No, no!

00:27:06.973 --> 00:27:08.801
Take him! Take him!

00:27:09.149 --> 00:27:11.804
Take him! Take him!

00:27:22.510 --> 00:27:25.339
You do it! Go, Go!

00:27:25.382 --> 00:27:28.298
Come on, go! Go!

00:27:28.342 --> 00:27:30.649
Come with me, it's okay! Come
on!

00:27:35.175 --> 00:27:38.352
Hey. What the fuck you
looking at? Get out of here.

00:27:42.138 --> 00:27:44.924
I'm not going to hurt you, okay?

00:27:44.967 --> 00:27:49.189
I'm taking you home to see your
mom. Mama. Would you like that?

00:27:49.232 --> 00:27:51.278
Good boy. Hold my hand.

00:28:11.864 --> 00:28:14.736
Shit!

00:28:48.248 --> 00:28:50.424
Oh, sorry!

00:28:50.467 --> 00:28:52.731
Mara! Mara. Hey.

00:28:58.127 --> 00:29:00.173
This way. This way!

00:29:06.179 --> 00:29:09.660
Here! Come on. Move,
move, move, come on!

00:29:13.926 --> 00:29:16.319
Come on! Go, go, go!

00:29:55.315 --> 00:29:57.230
Hey, we just...

00:29:59.188 --> 00:30:01.843
All right. Good boy.

00:30:05.804 --> 00:30:07.806
All right, she's here.

00:30:08.197 --> 00:30:10.199
Keep him here. Once we're paid,
we'll bring her in.

00:30:10.243 --> 00:30:12.593
Are you fucking serious?

00:30:12.636 --> 00:30:14.725
Business first.

00:30:16.727 --> 00:30:19.382
Two more minutes, I promise,
alright?

00:30:19.426 --> 00:30:22.081
- Thank you for your time.
- Of course.

00:30:22.429 --> 00:30:23.517
- May I go?
- He is waiting for you.

00:30:23.560 --> 00:30:25.301
Thank you.

00:30:26.694 --> 00:30:31.655
Oh, my God. Oh! Oh, my God!

00:30:31.699 --> 00:30:34.702
Oh, my God!

00:30:36.747 --> 00:30:40.099
Oh! Oh!

00:30:46.366 --> 00:30:48.542
Can I have what she's
having, please?

00:30:49.499 --> 00:30:51.153
Hey.

00:30:52.024 --> 00:30:53.634
How you doing?

00:30:58.421 --> 00:30:59.988
Your cut.

00:31:04.166 --> 00:31:08.083
- Thank you.
- Wow. That's...

00:31:08.127 --> 00:31:10.433
That's more than I make in six
months.

00:31:10.477 --> 00:31:14.176
Oh, that's just a fraction
of what I need for Amina.

00:31:14.220 --> 00:31:17.310
We did something good here.
You know that, right?

00:31:17.353 --> 00:31:20.095
So how come I feel like a
mercenary?

00:31:20.922 --> 00:31:23.359
We have to be paid
for the risks we take.

00:31:23.403 --> 00:31:25.361
She was desperate.

00:31:25.405 --> 00:31:29.452
But she found the
money. And that's good, right?

00:31:30.671 --> 00:31:32.412
I could never afford that.

00:31:32.455 --> 00:31:33.892
You won't have to.

00:31:35.850 --> 00:31:39.723
Right. "Quid pro quo".
It's the jobs they'll pay for it.

00:31:39.767 --> 00:31:41.725
Eventually.

00:31:41.769 --> 00:31:43.553
How long's eventually?

00:31:43.597 --> 00:31:45.686
Sometimes it's cut and dry.

00:31:45.729 --> 00:31:48.863
You know, you find the kid, you find
a way in. It's pretty straight forward.

00:31:48.907 --> 00:31:52.171
But not mine, right? Not Amina.

00:31:52.954 --> 00:31:57.872
Well, your ex is pretty good
at covering his tracks, but you know that.

00:31:57.916 --> 00:32:00.440
I mean, you've been looking
for him a lot longer than I have.

00:32:02.094 --> 00:32:04.574
You don't have kids of your own,
right?

00:32:04.618 --> 00:32:06.272
- No.
- So...

00:32:07.577 --> 00:32:09.362
Why do you do it?

00:32:12.104 --> 00:32:16.238
Well, I've just gotten out of
the Marines. Panama City Beach.

00:32:17.674 --> 00:32:22.114
Was pretty down and out.
Didn't have a lot of transferable skills.

00:32:22.157 --> 00:32:25.595
And I was hanging at the vet centre,
you know, looking for work.

00:32:25.639 --> 00:32:28.859
Then one day, this guy
comes in...

00:32:28.903 --> 00:32:32.341
...and he's talking about this Washington
mom who wanted her kid snatched back.

00:32:32.385 --> 00:32:34.343
You know, it was
really good money.

00:32:34.387 --> 00:32:37.042
Turns out...

00:32:37.085 --> 00:32:40.915
I was pretty good at it.
You know, gave me purpose.

00:32:42.525 --> 00:32:45.267
So then I don't know,
formed the unit, hired Carl.

00:32:46.573 --> 00:32:48.270
Rest is history.

00:32:49.750 --> 00:32:51.970
You ever had a job go bad?

00:32:54.363 --> 00:32:58.367
Let's not dwell on that. Okay?
Today was a good day.

00:32:59.629 --> 00:33:01.588
To your future.

00:33:06.027 --> 00:33:07.898
Scotland?

00:33:08.116 --> 00:33:10.075
The kid's grandmother gave evidence
that the stepfather is violent.

00:33:10.205 --> 00:33:12.381
Yeah, he has convictions,...

00:33:12.425 --> 00:33:14.628
...but he won't be in Edinburgh
when we snatch back,

00:33:14.652 --> 00:33:16.152
he'll be traveling for work.

00:33:35.535 --> 00:33:37.058
Okay.

00:34:03.650 --> 00:34:06.174
- May I help you?
- Yeah. Hi.

00:34:06.218 --> 00:34:09.351
Could you tell me who I need to speak to
get a list of all the hospitals in Lebanon?

00:34:11.179 --> 00:34:13.660
We have a new case. Top
priority.

00:34:15.488 --> 00:34:17.098
Albania!

00:34:17.620 --> 00:34:19.927
Thought it was getting pretty
rough out there. It's in chaos.

00:34:19.970 --> 00:34:22.234
Yeah, well, chaos is good cover.

00:34:25.411 --> 00:34:28.153
- Where's the rest of the intel?
- That's all I have.

00:35:08.541 --> 00:35:10.412
It's got to be this
one.

00:35:19.595 --> 00:35:20.205
There.

00:35:25.210 --> 00:35:27.995
Mara, grab her. Come
on.

00:35:28.038 --> 00:35:29.127
Aria?

00:35:31.346 --> 00:35:33.261
- Come with me, sweetheart.
- Come on. Come on. Come on.

00:35:33.348 --> 00:35:35.133
Let's go. Let's go.
Let's go.

00:35:38.571 --> 00:35:39.876
- Stay close.
- Let's go.

00:35:39.963 --> 00:35:42.227
This way. This way!

00:35:42.923 --> 00:35:44.620
Hey, hey, get the fuck
back!

00:35:55.675 --> 00:35:57.807
Get off her! Hey! Get
out!

00:36:02.769 --> 00:36:05.772
- Hey! Get the fuck out!
- Go, go, go!

00:36:07.252 --> 00:36:08.775
Against the wall.

00:36:16.913 --> 00:36:18.480
Come on, Let's go.

00:36:21.135 --> 00:36:22.615
- Let's go.
- Come on.

00:36:27.010 --> 00:36:29.578
- Come on, come on.
- Come on.

00:36:30.100 --> 00:36:31.798
- Come on, come on.
- Come on.

00:36:33.060 --> 00:36:34.801
Hey, we got to get to
the car.

00:36:36.106 --> 00:36:38.065
Go, go, go.

00:36:38.108 --> 00:36:39.849
Hey, back. Back.

00:36:42.983 --> 00:36:44.985
Stay back!

00:36:50.338 --> 00:36:52.122
- Go, go!
- Stay back!

00:37:15.145 --> 00:37:17.626
- Don't fucking touch me.
- Hey!

00:37:17.713 --> 00:37:19.237
Hey! Mara!

00:37:23.153 --> 00:37:26.244
Come on, run! We got to go. Go!

00:37:26.331 --> 00:37:28.246
- Go, go, go, go!
- Go, go!

00:37:37.124 --> 00:37:38.691
Fuck!

00:37:38.734 --> 00:37:40.214
Where's the transport?

00:37:40.736 --> 00:37:43.696
- Mitch?
- He pulled the plane.

00:37:43.739 --> 00:37:45.263
Who?

00:37:45.306 --> 00:37:46.916
Lewis.

00:37:48.570 --> 00:37:51.791
This is CIA?
Why the fuck didn't you tell us?

00:37:51.834 --> 00:37:54.010
CIA? What? Who's Lewis?

00:37:54.054 --> 00:37:56.839
- Hey. It was on a need to know basis.
- Need to...

00:37:57.275 --> 00:38:00.713
- Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.
- I'm your partner! I'm in need to know!

00:38:00.756 --> 00:38:03.672
Stop it. What does this mean?

00:38:03.716 --> 00:38:06.598
It means the CIA got us to do a dirty job
and now that it's gone wrong,

00:38:06.622 --> 00:38:08.155
they're leaving us in it.

00:38:08.242 --> 00:38:10.549
Is that true? They're not going
to help us?

00:38:10.592 --> 00:38:12.290
I'll figure it out.

00:38:13.160 --> 00:38:16.250
- I thought we worked for parents.
- We do.

00:38:16.294 --> 00:38:18.240
It's still a father getting back
his daughter,

00:38:18.264 --> 00:38:19.708
who pays us doesn't matter.

00:38:19.732 --> 00:38:21.603
Doesn't matter?

00:38:21.647 --> 00:38:25.303
What... what we do, who we do it
for is all the fucking matters.

00:38:27.043 --> 00:38:29.350
Get us the fuck out of here.

00:38:45.453 --> 00:38:47.281
I hope you know what you're doing.

00:38:47.325 --> 00:38:49.588
I'm helping people
get their kids back.

00:38:49.631 --> 00:38:52.242
And is this the best way
to get Amina back?

00:38:53.505 --> 00:38:57.726
Because you're just putting so much trust
in this thing. I just worry that...

00:38:58.336 --> 00:39:00.512
...you've lost track of where
you're trying to get to.

00:39:00.555 --> 00:39:03.863
Listen, I'll decide who or what
I trust.

00:39:03.906 --> 00:39:06.256
I have to go. Love you.

00:39:09.347 --> 00:39:14.221
Then 500 feet
and the venue is on the left.

00:39:14.264 --> 00:39:17.833
At least I think, it's a little
unclear.

00:39:17.877 --> 00:39:20.532
- Yeah, Carl's out taking photos.
- Okay.

00:39:20.880 --> 00:39:23.709
Main entrance is on the
main road.

00:39:23.752 --> 00:39:28.104
But there's another way on the corner
that takes us to the kitchen.

00:39:31.673 --> 00:39:34.372
- What? - You're kind of a
natural at this.

00:39:41.596 --> 00:39:44.556
What if we're giving her to the
wrong parent?

00:39:44.599 --> 00:39:46.862
What if the mother is no good?

00:39:46.906 --> 00:39:48.342
Where's this going?

00:39:54.522 --> 00:39:56.742
I almost got rid of her.

00:39:56.785 --> 00:39:58.221
Amina.

00:39:58.265 --> 00:40:00.746
And now I can't bear to
live without her.

00:40:02.073 --> 00:40:04.104
I met Karim in the hospital,

00:40:04.128 --> 00:40:06.328
I had all these problems
with my hands and feet.

00:40:06.447 --> 00:40:08.710
He did all my scans.

00:40:08.754 --> 00:40:11.234
We started
seeing each other after that.

00:40:11.278 --> 00:40:14.542
He was kind and funny and
took care of me.

00:40:14.586 --> 00:40:18.067
Made me feel safe. I never
intended to get pregnant.

00:40:18.111 --> 00:40:20.766
I freaked out.

00:40:20.809 --> 00:40:24.247
I left Karim a message, and
I drove myself to the clinic.

00:40:24.291 --> 00:40:29.209
Right when I was about to sign the papers,
Karim came rushing in,...

00:40:29.252 --> 00:40:32.255
...just... full of passion.

00:40:32.299 --> 00:40:34.736
That's what he was like
about the things that he loves.

00:40:34.780 --> 00:40:39.262
He said: "We can do this. It's
going to be okay".

00:40:40.525 --> 00:40:42.483
And it was. For a while.

00:40:44.093 --> 00:40:48.097
Then he started acting really
weird, staying out late.

00:40:49.359 --> 00:40:55.757
Wanted me to quit my job.
I started drinking too much, I guess.

00:40:55.801 --> 00:40:59.369
I mean, it's not really your fault.
You didn't really know the guy.

00:41:00.196 --> 00:41:03.112
How do you know what I should be
punishing myself for?

00:41:03.939 --> 00:41:05.637
Okay.

00:41:05.680 --> 00:41:07.595
Here's what I do know.

00:41:08.117 --> 00:41:11.730
Parents, they need you on these
jobs.

00:41:15.995 --> 00:41:17.953
What about you?

00:41:19.389 --> 00:41:21.217
Do you need me?

00:42:12.051 --> 00:42:13.531
Robeson.

00:42:32.245 --> 00:42:33.899
What have you got?

00:42:44.344 --> 00:42:47.477
- What about Romania?
- I'm working on it.

00:42:47.521 --> 00:42:50.045
Petra's father really wants his
daughter back.

00:42:50.089 --> 00:42:52.831
She's the most important thing
in the world to him.

00:42:52.874 --> 00:42:55.442
I don't object to your private cases,

00:42:55.485 --> 00:42:58.837
but not at the expense
of what the CIA needs from you.

00:42:58.880 --> 00:43:01.187
Okay, well, I think
I'm helping these parents, too.

00:43:01.230 --> 00:43:03.755
And I'm sure that they are very
grateful.

00:43:03.798 --> 00:43:07.280
But you're a military man,
so I know that you understand...

00:43:07.323 --> 00:43:11.632
...the plight of housewives and
grandparents is not quite as vital...

00:43:11.676 --> 00:43:14.417
...as keeping this country and
its assets safe.

00:43:14.461 --> 00:43:19.074
Stop deprioritizing my cases,
Mitchell, or you won't have any.

00:43:20.162 --> 00:43:24.471
All right, I'll move
Romania to the top of the list.

00:43:25.298 --> 00:43:28.475
- How're things going with Danning?
- Good.

00:43:28.518 --> 00:43:30.999
- She's still looking for her kid.
- Of course.

00:43:31.565 --> 00:43:34.568
Just remember to keep the trail cold
for as long as possible.

00:43:35.090 --> 00:43:36.918
Why would you say that?

00:43:36.962 --> 00:43:40.356
Karim Taleb is a dangerous man.

00:43:40.400 --> 00:43:42.620
She's better off without him in her life.

00:43:42.663 --> 00:43:44.883
How dangerous, Lewis?

00:43:44.926 --> 00:43:48.495
That's classified. You do your
job and I'll do mine.

00:43:53.195 --> 00:43:56.503
- Hi. Do you speak English?
- Yes, ma'am.

00:43:56.546 --> 00:43:58.984
Thank you. Ehm...

00:43:59.027 --> 00:44:02.074
I have a patient at your
hospital, but I can't read hischart.

00:44:02.117 --> 00:44:05.077
I can only read the name of the
radiologist.

00:44:05.294 --> 00:44:09.995
Can I speak to him, please?
His name's Karim Taleb.

00:44:10.038 --> 00:44:14.347
- One minute, please.
- Mm-mm.

00:44:14.390 --> 00:44:18.133
He is not working today.
Would you like to leave him a message?

00:44:18.177 --> 00:44:20.309
- Taleb?
- Yes.

00:44:20.353 --> 00:44:23.530
T-A-L-E-B.

00:44:23.573 --> 00:44:25.314
He does?

00:44:26.098 --> 00:44:27.665
That's him?

00:44:28.274 --> 00:44:29.623
That's him!

00:44:29.667 --> 00:44:32.887
- What? Amina?
- My God.

00:45:12.361 --> 00:45:13.711
Come on.

00:45:35.776 --> 00:45:37.952
- Mm...
- Mitchell.

00:45:40.520 --> 00:45:42.652
- Mitchell.
- Mm-mm?

00:45:42.696 --> 00:45:45.699
I found him. Karim is in
Lebanon.

00:45:48.484 --> 00:45:50.138
How did you?

00:45:50.182 --> 00:45:53.141
I tracked him down to a hospital
just outside Beirut.

00:45:53.185 --> 00:45:55.883
He's been working there for a
whole year.

00:45:55.927 --> 00:45:59.321
- Are you sure?
- Oh, Jesus Christ, Mitch.

00:45:59.365 --> 00:46:01.896
Do you know how many calls I've made to..

00:46:01.920 --> 00:46:04.220
..hospitals in Syria
and surrounding countries?

00:46:04.283 --> 00:46:09.157
Hundreds. And suddenly, just
like that, there he fucking is.

00:46:09.201 --> 00:46:11.159
He didn't even change his name.

00:46:14.162 --> 00:46:18.036
Oh, so that's what this is.
You come over. Use me.

00:46:19.254 --> 00:46:22.867
No. This is the best lead
I've ever had.

00:46:22.910 --> 00:46:25.695
- I just want to get out there.
- What am I always telling you?

00:46:25.739 --> 00:46:28.829
- You have to stop and think!
- Don't fucking yell at me.

00:46:28.873 --> 00:46:31.353
This is finally something real
for me.

00:46:31.658 --> 00:46:33.791
Okay. I'm sorry. I didn't...

00:46:34.269 --> 00:46:35.662
You're right.

00:46:36.619 --> 00:46:41.102
It's a good lead. But you won't
go out there on your own.

00:46:42.451 --> 00:46:45.569
So when the time is right,
we'll do it like all the others.

00:46:45.593 --> 00:46:47.393
Planned. Rehearsed.

00:46:47.413 --> 00:46:51.156
And when will be the right time,
Mitch? Because you keep saying that.

00:46:52.374 --> 00:46:56.030
The fucking time is now.
We need to get out there.

00:46:56.074 --> 00:46:58.641
Is the Beirut job still on the
table?

00:46:58.685 --> 00:47:00.818
No. The Beirut job is too risky.

00:47:01.035 --> 00:47:03.083
So you take it,
and then the client will pay..

00:47:03.107 --> 00:47:05.107
..for you to pull strings
to get us out there.

00:47:08.086 --> 00:47:09.914
Please.

00:47:14.005 --> 00:47:17.704
So, as far as we can tell, exit
points are here.

00:47:17.747 --> 00:47:19.539
And the rear trade entrance.

00:47:19.563 --> 00:47:21.863
That'll be our best bet to avoid
our private security.

00:47:21.882 --> 00:47:25.799
Right. Well, we only have one
invite, so it will have to be me.

00:47:25.843 --> 00:47:28.410
You get trapped, you have to
fight your way out alone.

00:47:28.454 --> 00:47:31.413
- Yeah. I've done it before.
- No.

00:47:31.457 --> 00:47:33.589
- I don't like it.
- What?

00:47:33.720 --> 00:47:35.942
You're kidding, right?
It's the perfect setup..

00:47:35.943 --> 00:47:37.961
..and the biggest score
we've ever gotten.

00:47:37.985 --> 00:47:40.466
You know Lebanon is still
unstable, right?

00:47:40.509 --> 00:47:44.731
Beirut is militarized, and these people
have money for private guards.

00:47:44.774 --> 00:47:47.370
I'm the one that has to get us out
if all goes to shit.

00:47:47.394 --> 00:47:49.194
Nah, this is a no go for me.

00:47:49.214 --> 00:47:51.651
No. I may never have
another chance to get out there.

00:47:51.694 --> 00:47:54.903
- We'll find another way.
- It's been eight years.

00:47:54.927 --> 00:47:56.023
Eight fucking years!

00:47:56.047 --> 00:47:58.614
How much more time
do you think I can wait?

00:47:59.615 --> 00:48:01.748
Jesus Christ.

00:48:09.669 --> 00:48:11.758
- What the fuck was that?
- I told you.

00:48:11.801 --> 00:48:13.499
I don't like it. It feels
dangerous.

00:48:13.542 --> 00:48:15.849
More dangerous than taking kids
from rich-as-fuck statesmen?

00:48:15.893 --> 00:48:18.504
Maybe she's better off if she
lets this whole Lebanon lead go.

00:48:18.591 --> 00:48:20.506
Are you serious?

00:48:20.549 --> 00:48:23.204
She's done all those jobs with us because
you made her a promise...

00:48:23.248 --> 00:48:25.554
...that one of them would be her
own kid.

00:48:27.513 --> 00:48:31.038
Imagine that, Mitch, having a
mother who loved you that much.

00:48:32.387 --> 00:48:34.912
I sure as shit wouldn't have
ended up here.

00:48:38.089 --> 00:48:42.441
Come on, man.
Help us figure out the snatch.

00:48:42.484 --> 00:48:45.226
Then we'll go out there, do it
as well as we usually do it,...

00:48:45.270 --> 00:48:47.881
...and then afterwards we'll
help her get her daughter back.

00:48:49.230 --> 00:48:50.536
Okay?

00:48:54.105 --> 00:48:56.411
Come on, man, fuckin' do this.

00:48:56.455 --> 00:48:58.370
Okay.

00:48:59.893 --> 00:49:02.156
- We're good.
- What?

00:49:03.549 --> 00:49:06.944
You better know this house inside and out.
Every room, every exit.

00:49:08.423 --> 00:49:11.165
And this one's by the book.
My rules. Okay?

00:49:11.209 --> 00:49:12.253
Yeah.

00:49:13.211 --> 00:49:14.560
Yeah.

00:49:14.603 --> 00:49:15.953
Thank you.

00:49:16.475 --> 00:49:18.085
Okay.

00:49:21.349 --> 00:49:22.829
It's for you.

00:49:34.014 --> 00:49:36.408
I've waited
as long as I could for Amina.

00:49:38.453 --> 00:49:42.544
When your mom left, remember?

00:49:42.631 --> 00:49:44.982
I didn't know...

00:49:45.025 --> 00:49:48.202
...whether either of us would be
okay.

00:49:48.246 --> 00:49:52.293
You were so tiny.
Remember?

00:49:52.337 --> 00:49:55.470
I took you to the park.

00:49:55.514 --> 00:50:00.519
You climbed a jungle gym and you
fell off.

00:50:00.562 --> 00:50:03.087
I bashed my teeth.

00:50:03.130 --> 00:50:07.221
And that woman,
she came...

00:50:07.265 --> 00:50:09.310
...rushing over.

00:50:09.354 --> 00:50:15.186
She said: "Where is your
mother?" And you said...

00:50:15.838 --> 00:50:20.887
"My mom's gone. But my dad's
here and we're just fine."

00:50:22.976 --> 00:50:28.677
That's when I knew
you would always be okay.

00:50:30.462 --> 00:50:33.726
- You have to be strong for me.
- No.

00:50:33.769 --> 00:50:36.729
Dad, please, no.

00:50:36.772 --> 00:50:43.214
You tell her I love her so much.

00:50:43.257 --> 00:50:47.522
Hey, dad, dad...

00:50:48.871 --> 00:50:50.786
I need to rest now.

00:50:53.398 --> 00:50:55.226
Yeah.

00:52:38.459 --> 00:52:40.157
You okay?

00:52:41.375 --> 00:52:44.291
Hi! Mama!

00:52:44.335 --> 00:52:46.424
- Who are you and what did you
do with Soraya? - Hey!

00:52:46.467 --> 00:52:49.601
You're so tall.
Get over here. Your mom's here?

00:52:49.644 --> 00:52:51.168
Yeah.

00:52:51.777 --> 00:52:53.909
Oh!

00:52:57.348 --> 00:52:58.914
It's so good to see
you.

00:53:00.177 --> 00:53:03.136
- Oh, long time.
- Too long, Dasia.

00:53:03.745 --> 00:53:06.008
- This is Mara.
- Hi. / Hi.

00:53:06.531 --> 00:53:10.143
Soraya, go and get the tea.
Please.

00:53:12.754 --> 00:53:14.626
Nothing changed around
here.

00:53:14.669 --> 00:53:18.630
No, it's like a zoo in here sometimes.
I hope you don't mind.

00:53:18.673 --> 00:53:20.328
But you'll be sleeping
in the living room.

00:53:20.352 --> 00:53:21.348
Oh, no.

00:53:21.372 --> 00:53:24.244
I didn't want you
to have to share with the men.

00:53:24.288 --> 00:53:26.028
That's very thoughtful. Thank
you.

00:53:26.507 --> 00:53:28.205
Come on.

00:53:34.036 --> 00:53:37.794
Robeson told me that your
ex-husband is living here.

00:53:37.818 --> 00:53:39.718
You are okay to talk about it?

00:53:39.738 --> 00:53:41.392
Yeah, of course.

00:53:43.089 --> 00:53:45.918
- For you.
- Oh, thank you. Thank you.

00:53:47.049 --> 00:53:48.225
Please.

00:53:50.618 --> 00:53:53.099
- She's wonderful.
- They grow so fast.

00:53:53.578 --> 00:53:56.189
Do you know where your ex works?

00:53:56.233 --> 00:53:59.425
At a hospital just outside the city,
I think.

00:53:59.449 --> 00:54:01.432
But I don't know where he lives.

00:54:02.456 --> 00:54:04.284
I'll take you there tomorrow.

00:54:05.242 --> 00:54:07.461
See if we can find out.

00:54:25.174 --> 00:54:26.698
Hey.

00:54:29.048 --> 00:54:33.487
I think I might finally be under the same
little patch of stars that she is.

00:54:39.406 --> 00:54:41.713
I know you feel close to her.

00:54:43.932 --> 00:54:47.545
I really need you focused
on this job first. Okay?

00:54:48.589 --> 00:54:50.156
I know.

00:55:31.676 --> 00:55:35.332
He was on a temporary contract.
He's not here anymore.

00:55:41.076 --> 00:55:44.123
Hey. It's a process.

00:55:44.166 --> 00:55:46.778
He's in the city.

00:55:46.821 --> 00:55:48.780
We're going to find him.

00:56:15.546 --> 00:56:18.200
- Can you move in it?
- Think so.

00:56:18.244 --> 00:56:20.072
Yeah.

00:56:23.075 --> 00:56:25.077
Okay. No heroics
tonight.

00:56:28.950 --> 00:56:31.562
Grab the kid
and you get out of there.

00:56:31.953 --> 00:56:34.347
Be careful, Mara.

00:56:59.851 --> 00:57:01.505
Thank you.

00:57:04.072 --> 00:57:05.726
As-salam alaykom.

00:57:07.206 --> 00:57:09.774
Wa Alykom As-slam.

00:57:09.817 --> 00:57:12.908
- Are you from the embassy?
- Oh, God, no. Fuck politics.

00:57:12.932 --> 00:57:13.932
I'm in finance.

00:57:15.083 --> 00:57:17.782
Oh, excellent.

00:57:17.825 --> 00:57:22.047
Please do tell me if you need
an introduction to any of my other guests.

00:57:22.090 --> 00:57:24.179
That is so kind of you.

00:57:24.223 --> 00:57:27.574
In the meantime, could you point me
the direction of the ladies room?

00:57:27.618 --> 00:57:30.534
- It's down the hall.
- Thank you. Oh!

00:57:30.577 --> 00:57:32.971
Shukran jaziilan.

00:58:37.165 --> 00:58:39.254
Come on. There's a good
girl.

00:58:40.255 --> 00:58:42.823
Okay, let's go. Come on.

00:58:58.447 --> 00:59:00.275
It's gonna be okay.

00:59:33.918 --> 00:59:37.399
What are you doing with my
daughter?

00:59:38.096 --> 00:59:41.142
- I'm not going to hurt her.
- You're taking her away from me?

00:59:55.069 --> 00:59:57.071
Don't.

00:59:59.030 --> 01:00:00.945
Salma, come.

01:00:10.041 --> 01:00:11.782
Salma.

01:00:13.958 --> 01:00:16.047
- Oh...
- Oh my God.

01:00:19.964 --> 01:00:21.705
Is that her?

01:00:29.626 --> 01:00:31.976
- You okay?
- Drive!

01:00:36.197 --> 01:00:37.851
I see 'em, hang on.

01:00:39.287 --> 01:00:40.898
I got you, baby.

01:00:43.291 --> 01:00:45.554
Get down!

01:00:45.598 --> 01:00:47.165
Keep your heads down!

01:00:50.690 --> 01:00:53.127
One way. Watch out!
Shit.

01:00:57.131 --> 01:00:59.133
What happened in there?

01:01:01.788 --> 01:01:03.747
Mara, are you going to
tell us?

01:01:19.545 --> 01:01:21.721
That's a good girl.

01:01:24.332 --> 01:01:25.986
Alright...

01:01:36.301 --> 01:01:38.259
That's a good girl.

01:01:41.915 --> 01:01:43.743
Okay, it's okay.

01:01:51.838 --> 01:01:53.492
He's here.

01:01:59.193 --> 01:02:01.543
Of course.

01:02:03.589 --> 01:02:05.504
Thank you so much.

01:02:26.612 --> 01:02:28.745
It was an accident, Mara.

01:02:33.445 --> 01:02:36.143
You're not going to let me look
for Amina anymore, are you?

01:02:49.678 --> 01:02:52.681
Okay, I'm going out.
See if I can find us a way home.

01:02:52.725 --> 01:02:54.640
- I'll come.
- No.

01:02:55.032 --> 01:02:56.993
It's not safe.
Stay here at the hotel.

01:02:57.017 --> 01:03:00.117
At least until I can find out
if we're in the clear.

01:03:29.806 --> 01:03:31.982
Who is it?

01:03:32.025 --> 01:03:34.811
- Dasia.
- It's Dasia.

01:03:36.073 --> 01:03:38.423
- Dasia!
- Okay, okay, okay. Hey.

01:03:39.250 --> 01:03:41.165
- Hey.
- Hey.

01:03:43.863 --> 01:03:45.952
- You shouldn't be here.
- I have a lead.

01:03:46.344 --> 01:03:47.649
On what?

01:03:48.346 --> 01:03:50.522
On Amina.

01:03:51.175 --> 01:03:53.481
- No. No. Wait for Robeson.
- We have to go.

01:03:53.525 --> 01:03:56.615
No. You know, a lead only lasts
so long. I'll go by myself.

01:03:56.658 --> 01:04:00.010
- No. You heard what he said.
- A couple of hours, tops.

01:04:00.053 --> 01:04:01.838
Then at least we'll have some
intel.

01:04:05.189 --> 01:04:06.755
Shit.

01:04:08.409 --> 01:04:09.802
You should wait here.

01:04:11.238 --> 01:04:13.327
- In and out. Okay?
- Yeah. Okay.

01:04:19.507 --> 01:04:21.205
What are you doing out
here?

01:04:21.248 --> 01:04:22.946
This is my territory.

01:04:25.165 --> 01:04:28.038
The more pertinent question is:...

01:04:28.081 --> 01:04:32.172
...what the hell are you doing out here
and not in Romania, like I ordered you to?

01:04:35.654 --> 01:04:38.787
And at the center of all this is
Denning,...

01:04:38.831 --> 01:04:42.443
...who's compromised us with
a snatch back caught up in a bloodbath.

01:04:42.574 --> 01:04:45.055
A woman who shouldn't be
anywhere near here...

01:04:45.098 --> 01:04:48.275
...but is at risk of destroying everything
that I've worked for the last eight years.

01:04:48.319 --> 01:04:50.582
And a woman who's the only one
who could've gotten us in and out.

01:04:50.625 --> 01:04:52.540
- Is that right?
- That's right.

01:04:52.584 --> 01:04:55.892
And you're telling me that you
had to take a job in Beirut?

01:04:57.284 --> 01:04:59.808
She goes to school
with her youngest granddaughter.

01:05:01.114 --> 01:05:03.769
Where? Have you met her?
Amina.

01:05:03.856 --> 01:05:06.641
Have you met Amina?

01:05:06.685 --> 01:05:10.210
Once. She is... Rather a rebel,
I think.

01:05:10.254 --> 01:05:14.475
Once. She thinks that Amina is
rather a rebel.

01:05:14.519 --> 01:05:18.349
Is she? That's good.

01:05:22.092 --> 01:05:24.485
What time do the schools
finish?

01:05:24.529 --> 01:05:27.662
- At 3:00 p.m...
- Okay, could she give me an address?

01:05:27.706 --> 01:05:30.796
Robeson,
let me make it absolutely clear to you,

01:05:30.839 --> 01:05:33.016
as you don't seem to have got
the message.

01:05:33.059 --> 01:05:37.846
It is imperative to my interests
and therefore to yours,...

01:05:37.890 --> 01:05:40.501
...that she does not find Karim
Taleb.

01:05:40.545 --> 01:05:44.679
So when you asked me to stop
looking into Karim, I did.

01:05:44.723 --> 01:05:47.769
But if you expect me to keep
that mother from her daughter,...

01:05:47.813 --> 01:05:50.511
...you better tell me what the
fuck's really going on right now.

01:05:53.688 --> 01:05:56.691
How much do you know
about your husband's life here?

01:05:57.083 --> 01:05:59.390
What do you know
about your husband's life here?

01:05:59.607 --> 01:06:01.914
I mean, nothing. Why?

01:06:01.958 --> 01:06:03.916
Why do you ask?

01:06:03.960 --> 01:06:06.963
- It's late. I should go.
- Why? Wait.

01:06:08.442 --> 01:06:10.140
She should leave.

01:06:10.183 --> 01:06:13.360
Wait. Give her the address. Please?

01:06:13.839 --> 01:06:16.973
- I can't.
- Please, please. As a mother.

01:06:21.455 --> 01:06:25.459
As a mother,
I tell you to go see your daughter.

01:06:25.503 --> 01:06:28.245
See that she is well, but then
you should leave.

01:06:28.288 --> 01:06:31.248
As a mother she tells you:
go see your daughter,

01:06:31.291 --> 01:06:33.859
see that she is fine.
But then you should leave.

01:06:35.513 --> 01:06:38.864
The enemy of my enemy is my friend.

01:06:40.257 --> 01:06:41.954
Good luck.

01:06:50.049 --> 01:06:51.840
Listen. I cannot come to the school.

01:06:51.864 --> 01:06:54.164
I cannot bring trouble to my family.
Do you understand?

01:06:54.184 --> 01:06:56.403
Of course. Of course.

01:06:56.447 --> 01:06:58.451
You've done more to help me
in a few days..

01:06:58.475 --> 01:07:00.475
..than anyone in my own country did
for years.

01:07:00.494 --> 01:07:02.279
Go.

01:07:03.193 --> 01:07:05.586
- You had me lie to her.
- No.

01:07:06.631 --> 01:07:08.807
It's not lying if you didn't
have all the facts.

01:07:08.850 --> 01:07:10.983
- Oh!
- Fuck you.

01:07:11.027 --> 01:07:13.072
I tipped you off to her,...

01:07:13.159 --> 01:07:16.510
...so you could give her an opportunity
to get involved in something, right?

01:07:16.554 --> 01:07:17.217
Distract her.

01:07:17.241 --> 01:07:18.836
Something that would give her
life purpose.

01:07:18.860 --> 01:07:21.646
- And then you let her lead you right here.
- You used me.

01:07:21.689 --> 01:07:24.953
You need to convince her that
the leads she has are false...

01:07:24.997 --> 01:07:26.520
...and you need to get her
out of the country immediately.

01:07:26.564 --> 01:07:28.479
And if I don't?

01:07:28.522 --> 01:07:31.743
Then I can't guarantee that she
or her family will be safe.

01:07:33.397 --> 01:07:36.139
- From you.
- From anybody.

01:07:36.182 --> 01:07:38.778
Her desperation is making
the situation unstable.

01:07:38.802 --> 01:07:40.602
And that's when people get hurt.

01:07:41.100 --> 01:07:44.016
Do you really want that
on your conscience?

01:07:45.322 --> 01:07:48.918
I need you to serve your country right now,
not her.

01:07:48.942 --> 01:07:50.742
I know you understand that.

01:07:51.893 --> 01:07:54.287
And never put your hands
on me like that again.

01:08:02.469 --> 01:08:04.689
It's it.

01:08:15.003 --> 01:08:19.095
It looks pretty secure.
Heavy gates, guards, CCTV.

01:08:20.661 --> 01:08:23.229
No back entrance.

01:08:23.273 --> 01:08:24.709
School got out 10 minutes ago.

01:08:26.276 --> 01:08:28.452
So she lives?

01:08:31.542 --> 01:08:34.501
- Hey.
- What?

01:08:40.159 --> 01:08:41.900
Is that her?

01:09:19.894 --> 01:09:23.028
Hey, hey, hey! They'll see you.
Shut the door.

01:09:26.118 --> 01:09:30.340
We have no plan. Anything you do now,
we just tip them off and ruin everything.

01:09:31.776 --> 01:09:33.778
Hide your face.

01:10:08.247 --> 01:10:11.816
No! Hey! Hey! Fuck.

01:11:53.961 --> 01:11:57.182
Amina! Amina!

01:11:59.140 --> 01:12:00.794
What the fuck have you done?

01:12:00.838 --> 01:12:04.494
Take her.
Just take her to the car.

01:12:04.537 --> 01:12:06.191
Amina!

01:12:11.979 --> 01:12:14.417
Be careful! Be careful!

01:12:14.634 --> 01:12:18.029
- Try to keep her calm.
- Go, go, go, go!

01:12:18.072 --> 01:12:20.553
- Come on!

01:12:22.599 --> 01:12:25.253
- Hey, Mara, Come on!
- It's okay. It's okay.

01:12:25.297 --> 01:12:27.865
Nobody's going to hurt you,
okay?

01:12:27.908 --> 01:12:29.519
- Amina...
- Fuck. Come on.

01:12:32.826 --> 01:12:34.741
- What does that mean? Carl!
- I don't know. I don't know!

01:12:34.785 --> 01:12:36.743
Amina!

01:12:36.830 --> 01:12:38.092
What are you doing, Carl?

01:12:39.224 --> 01:12:41.748
- Carl, go!
- Okay.

01:12:41.792 --> 01:12:43.750
Come on, Come on, come
on. Damn it, come on!

01:12:44.751 --> 01:12:46.840
Fuck! Here we go, here we
go.

01:12:49.103 --> 01:12:50.844
No, no!

01:12:56.546 --> 01:13:00.245
- No, no, no. She cannot be here.
- No, no, no, let us in, let us in.

01:13:00.288 --> 01:13:01.986
Just until we figure this mess
out.

01:13:03.770 --> 01:13:06.817
It's all right. Does she speak English?
I don't know if she speaks English.

01:13:09.123 --> 01:13:10.429
Amina?

01:13:23.050 --> 01:13:25.009
Tell her I love her.

01:13:25.096 --> 01:13:27.359
And tell her she should never have been
brought to this country.

01:13:27.707 --> 01:13:30.710
And I didn't know
and I couldn't find her.

01:13:30.754 --> 01:13:33.409
And I just... I just want to
take her back to America,...

01:13:33.452 --> 01:13:37.064
...to be her mom, to be your
mom.

01:13:37.108 --> 01:13:39.893
She is your mother.
She is your mother, Amina.

01:13:41.721 --> 01:13:45.333
I don't have a mother.
My mother is dead.

01:13:48.075 --> 01:13:49.903
What?

01:13:50.948 --> 01:13:55.605
She said: "I don't have a
mother. My mother is dead".

01:14:08.182 --> 01:14:10.141
What's going on?

01:14:10.184 --> 01:14:12.796
- What the fuck!
- It's not how it looks.

01:14:13.013 --> 01:14:15.363
- Really? - We had to grab her.
We had no other choice.

01:14:17.844 --> 01:14:19.759
We can't stay here.

01:14:31.684 --> 01:14:34.034
- Amina. Amina, you have to come with me.
- No!

01:14:40.084 --> 01:14:42.260
Take this.

01:14:42.303 --> 01:14:46.307
You should have known better.
It was the wrong way.

01:15:40.840 --> 01:15:45.541
So, ehm... Carl just told me
you speak good English.

01:15:48.413 --> 01:15:50.546
You're stubborn, huh?

01:15:51.808 --> 01:15:54.027
I guess you got something from
me after all.

01:15:56.682 --> 01:15:58.728
Maybe he's wrong.
Maybe you don't speak.

01:16:00.207 --> 01:16:02.209
I'm top of my class in English.

01:16:03.776 --> 01:16:05.778
You were always super smart,
Mina.

01:16:05.952 --> 01:16:08.085
Amina.

01:16:08.128 --> 01:16:09.739
Amina, sorry.

01:16:13.830 --> 01:16:18.443
Ehm... I have carried this
every day since you left.

01:16:29.889 --> 01:16:31.587
Also...

01:16:34.894 --> 01:16:36.853
This is me and you.

01:16:37.288 --> 01:16:39.595
You're four, it's your
birthday.

01:16:41.901 --> 01:16:48.081
You're much older now.
Do you have any hobbies?

01:16:50.431 --> 01:16:52.303
You still like swimming?

01:16:52.346 --> 01:16:55.393
- We have a pool.
- Wow. Huh? You do?

01:16:55.436 --> 01:16:57.874
I race on the team.

01:16:58.265 --> 01:17:00.398
I'm... How do you say?

01:17:00.441 --> 01:17:02.313
- Oh, Captain?
- Captain.

01:17:02.356 --> 01:17:03.619
Wow.

01:17:05.098 --> 01:17:09.059
You know, I was the one
who taught you how to swim.

01:17:10.103 --> 01:17:13.629
At home, at the lake,
with your grandpa.

01:17:16.240 --> 01:17:18.416
I have my "jaddy" here.

01:17:18.459 --> 01:17:20.636
Your "jaddy", that's what you
call?

01:17:22.159 --> 01:17:23.421
Where is he?

01:17:25.728 --> 01:17:28.992
Oh... He died.

01:17:29.035 --> 01:17:32.430
He'd been sick for a long
time,...

01:17:32.473 --> 01:17:36.608
...but he wanted me to tell you
that he loved you...

01:17:36.652 --> 01:17:38.523
...very, very much.

01:17:43.659 --> 01:17:45.312
You should have
waited.

01:17:45.356 --> 01:17:48.576
I'm done waiting, dummy. I saw
an opportunity and I took it.

01:17:48.620 --> 01:17:51.014
- You're reckless.
- I'm her mother.

01:17:52.624 --> 01:17:57.107
I saw her, you know?
After all this time.

01:17:57.934 --> 01:18:00.676
I'd imagined it for so long.

01:18:02.590 --> 01:18:06.029
My heart, Mitchell.
I couldn't wait

01:18:09.162 --> 01:18:15.168
Mitchell, it's me. I imagined
her running into my harms.

01:18:15.212 --> 01:18:18.694
But now she's looking at me
like I'm a fucking monster.

01:18:22.436 --> 01:18:24.308
How do we get out of this
country?

01:18:26.527 --> 01:18:28.704
We have to take Amina back to
Karim.

01:18:30.053 --> 01:18:32.708
- Is that a joke?
- I can't get her out.

01:18:32.751 --> 01:18:34.666
We're all in danger if we don't
return her.

01:18:34.710 --> 01:18:37.147
Why? What's happened?

01:18:37.190 --> 01:18:38.670
You have to trust me.

01:18:38.714 --> 01:18:40.672
- Oh, what? Trust you?
- Yes.

01:18:40.716 --> 01:18:44.632
After I finally do the thing that
no one was prepared to help me with,...

01:18:44.676 --> 01:18:46.286
...you're telling me to take her
back?

01:18:46.330 --> 01:18:48.506
What the fuck is going on?

01:18:48.549 --> 01:18:50.769
If you try to get past me,
I will kill you.

01:18:50.813 --> 01:18:53.293
If you play one finger on her,
I will fuck you up.

01:18:53.337 --> 01:18:56.688
- Stop! Stop!
- Tell me what's going... Tell me!

01:19:00.736 --> 01:19:02.738
Karim has ties to Muslim
Brotherhood.

01:19:04.609 --> 01:19:06.916
There, now you know.

01:19:06.959 --> 01:19:08.526
What?

01:19:10.136 --> 01:19:12.748
Apparently, he got caught up
to his family's connections.

01:19:12.835 --> 01:19:15.054
They blackmailed him
into laundering money for them.

01:19:15.576 --> 01:19:17.753
And that's when the CIA
discovered him.

01:19:18.362 --> 01:19:20.538
Oh, the CIA knew?

01:19:20.581 --> 01:19:25.282
Mara, we're hired contractors.

01:19:25.325 --> 01:19:30.156
My contact, Louis, told me Karim cut a deal
with the CIA as an informant.

01:19:31.331 --> 01:19:33.203
He works for them.

01:19:35.596 --> 01:19:37.773
In return, he gets to keep
Amina.

01:19:38.991 --> 01:19:41.864
He's been relocating
them out here.

01:19:41.907 --> 01:19:44.040
Sorry. I just found
this out.

01:19:46.303 --> 01:19:48.305
All those dead ends.

01:19:50.611 --> 01:19:54.920
He blocked my search in Washington,
and hired you to keep me from her.

01:19:57.401 --> 01:19:58.837
Yes.

01:20:01.535 --> 01:20:03.668
Okay. Muslim Brotherhood.

01:20:05.844 --> 01:20:07.803
I thought he was having affairs.

01:20:09.239 --> 01:20:11.807
If we don't get you out
and return her...

01:20:14.331 --> 01:20:16.724
...I honestly don't know what he
might do.

01:20:16.768 --> 01:20:21.686
Oh! Oh!

01:20:21.729 --> 01:20:23.427
- Please, stop...
- OH!

01:20:23.862 --> 01:20:26.430
You kept me working for you.

01:20:26.473 --> 01:20:29.302
You slept with me.

01:20:29.694 --> 01:20:31.827
I'm sorry, okay?

01:20:38.921 --> 01:20:42.272
So what are you going to do now,
Mitch?

01:20:42.315 --> 01:20:45.841
Because I am not giving her
back. And we both know it.

01:20:47.364 --> 01:20:50.454
So either help me or let me go.

01:20:58.984 --> 01:21:01.813
When this is over, I never want
to hear from you again.

01:21:11.518 --> 01:21:12.955
You're ready?

01:21:27.839 --> 01:21:29.972
Here. Keep your faces covered.

01:21:48.512 --> 01:21:50.253
Where are we?

01:21:50.296 --> 01:21:52.516
We need to stop for papers
so we can get across the border.

01:21:55.867 --> 01:22:00.350
Thanks for being so quick. I owe you.
I'll call you when I get to Damascus.

01:22:08.184 --> 01:22:09.925
Is he your husband?

01:22:11.013 --> 01:22:12.318
No.

01:22:13.406 --> 01:22:15.626
Would he be with us in America?

01:22:16.061 --> 01:22:18.934
No, we just... We just work
together, that's all.

01:22:20.761 --> 01:22:22.938
Hey, do you want a swing?

01:22:26.680 --> 01:22:28.334
Come on.

01:22:32.817 --> 01:22:34.862
It's okay. You on?

01:22:35.907 --> 01:22:38.040
- Mm-mm.
- All right, I got you.

01:22:39.041 --> 01:22:43.915
Okay. Are you ready? One, two,
three.

01:23:44.758 --> 01:23:46.891
I have something similar.

01:24:16.007 --> 01:24:18.183
Passport.

01:24:56.787 --> 01:24:58.484
There are Americans here.

01:24:59.572 --> 01:25:01.792
They want to see your papers.

01:25:06.579 --> 01:25:08.364
Shit.

01:25:08.886 --> 01:25:10.627
Fuck.

01:25:21.855 --> 01:25:23.640
What is happening?

01:25:23.944 --> 01:25:26.686
- We can find another route.
- It will be like this everywhere.

01:25:29.341 --> 01:25:31.387
Going somewhere?

01:25:33.171 --> 01:25:35.130
Go, go. "Yalla"!

01:25:36.653 --> 01:25:38.133
Are you American?

01:25:39.569 --> 01:25:41.788
Are you traveling
with anyone?

01:25:42.528 --> 01:25:45.009
Wait. Damn, what are you doing?

01:25:45.052 --> 01:25:48.143
What's best for us, Mitch.
It's okay, come on, sweetie.

01:25:48.752 --> 01:25:50.928
Mara...

01:25:51.015 --> 01:25:53.732
Say whatever you need to say
to keep us safe.

01:25:53.756 --> 01:25:55.343
I'm not losing her again.

01:25:55.367 --> 01:25:57.195
- Hey!
- Go, Amina.

01:26:04.246 --> 01:26:05.986
Don't move!

01:26:07.118 --> 01:26:09.425
Put the gun down!
Put the gun down!

01:26:12.384 --> 01:26:15.866
Go! Go when you have the chance!
Go!

01:26:31.969 --> 01:26:33.492
Where are we going now?

01:26:34.014 --> 01:26:36.408
I'm going to find us somewhere
to cross. It will be okay.

01:26:37.627 --> 01:26:39.672
I'm hungry.

01:26:42.240 --> 01:26:43.937
Here.

01:26:43.981 --> 01:26:45.678
I only eat vegetables.

01:26:46.592 --> 01:26:48.420
I don't have anything else.

01:26:50.117 --> 01:26:53.077
- I want to go home now.
- I told you.

01:26:53.860 --> 01:26:55.210
We are going home.

01:26:56.123 --> 01:26:57.516
Not to America.

01:27:00.650 --> 01:27:03.261
I like it here.
I like my friends and my house.

01:27:05.872 --> 01:27:07.570
Listen.

01:27:07.918 --> 01:27:10.703
You're going to make
so many new friends in America.

01:27:11.704 --> 01:27:13.315
"Jaddy" won't be there.

01:27:14.272 --> 01:27:16.492
- Well, no...
- Who will be?

01:27:19.799 --> 01:27:22.237
Me, Mina.

01:27:24.674 --> 01:27:26.328
Amina.

01:27:27.720 --> 01:27:29.113
Amina.

01:27:29.592 --> 01:27:31.333
You and me.

01:27:32.072 --> 01:27:34.249
I don't want to be with you.

01:27:36.729 --> 01:27:39.210
Okay, well, you don't mean that.

01:27:39.254 --> 01:27:41.386
I want to stay with baba. Why
would you take me away from him?

01:27:41.430 --> 01:27:43.258
Hey! Sit down.

01:27:44.911 --> 01:27:48.698
Sorry. I didn't mean
to hurt you. Are you okay?

01:27:51.570 --> 01:27:53.268
It's just...

01:27:55.879 --> 01:27:58.664
You don't know how hard it's been.

01:27:58.708 --> 01:28:01.145
And...

01:28:01.188 --> 01:28:04.191
...how long it has taken me to
find you.

01:28:07.151 --> 01:28:09.284
But I was never lost.

01:28:12.678 --> 01:28:14.506
What?

01:28:16.987 --> 01:28:19.294
I was just at home.

01:28:24.255 --> 01:28:26.736
I never asked you
to come and find me.

01:29:07.472 --> 01:29:11.607
- Where are you going?
- It's okay, I'm just... Wait there.

01:30:31.121 --> 01:30:32.122
Where is she?

01:30:34.603 --> 01:30:36.126
She's safe.

01:30:36.169 --> 01:30:37.649
- Who's she with?
- A friend.

01:30:37.910 --> 01:30:40.957
- I need to see her. Now.
- Yeah, it hurts, doesn't it?

01:30:42.132 --> 01:30:43.873
Eight years of hurt.

01:30:43.960 --> 01:30:45.483
- How could you do it?
- I'm sorry.

01:30:46.963 --> 01:30:48.747
I'm sorry.

01:30:51.184 --> 01:30:53.317
I'm sorry for what I've done to
you, everything.

01:30:53.360 --> 01:30:55.972
I swear, Mara. I was... I was
cornered.

01:30:56.015 --> 01:30:58.714
If I stayed, I would
have put both of you in danger.

01:30:58.931 --> 01:31:02.108
And now she's been protected
by a very powerful organization.

01:31:02.152 --> 01:31:07.418
Yeah. Who helped you to kidnap her.
Do you understand how crazy that sounds?

01:31:07.462 --> 01:31:11.074
The people I work for threatened me
and the family if I didn't relocate,...

01:31:11.117 --> 01:31:12.771
...I couldn't face it without
her.

01:31:12.858 --> 01:31:15.295
And honestly, I wanted to give
her a better life.

01:31:15.339 --> 01:31:18.777
As long as I kept quiet and
played by the rules, they gave us that.

01:31:19.038 --> 01:31:21.476
You stole her from me.

01:31:23.913 --> 01:31:26.176
My little girl.

01:31:27.786 --> 01:31:29.484
Our little girl.

01:31:32.922 --> 01:31:34.880
Don't you fucking come near me.

01:31:38.536 --> 01:31:40.756
Sorry. Okay?

01:32:05.345 --> 01:32:07.826
Did you know I was looking for
you?

01:32:07.870 --> 01:32:11.700
They kept telling me you were
getting on with your life.

01:32:12.962 --> 01:32:14.920
And you believed that?

01:32:15.834 --> 01:32:17.532
It was easier that way.

01:32:18.315 --> 01:32:20.447
You took my most...

01:32:21.057 --> 01:32:23.712
...precious thing I've ever had.

01:32:24.626 --> 01:32:27.803
You obliterated my life.

01:32:27.846 --> 01:32:31.241
And you spent this whole time
telling her that I was dead.

01:32:32.329 --> 01:32:36.159
I don't... I don't get
how you can hate me that much.

01:32:36.202 --> 01:32:38.814
- I don't. I don't hate you. I thought...
- Shut up!

01:32:38.857 --> 01:32:41.686
I don't give a fuck of what you
think, Karim.

01:32:41.773 --> 01:32:44.037
I swear to God,
if you say another fucking word,

01:32:44.061 --> 01:32:45.161
I will kill you.

01:32:46.082 --> 01:32:48.214
You have no idea.

01:32:57.223 --> 01:33:00.836
But she's not the little girl
that I lost anymore.

01:33:03.665 --> 01:33:05.971
She doesn't know me.

01:33:09.018 --> 01:33:10.454
So I guess...

01:33:11.934 --> 01:33:15.241
...I kind of am dead, aren't I?

01:33:15.894 --> 01:33:17.679
Thanks to you.

01:33:28.907 --> 01:33:31.606
Promise me she'll be safe with
you.

01:33:35.827 --> 01:33:37.524
Promise me!

01:33:39.004 --> 01:33:40.832
I promise.

01:33:40.876 --> 01:33:42.660
She's safe.

01:33:42.704 --> 01:33:45.532
She's happy.
She has a good life here.

01:33:45.576 --> 01:33:47.578
You're seeing it for
yourself.

01:33:47.622 --> 01:33:51.190
Was it ever real? You and me?

01:33:54.324 --> 01:33:57.675
Yes. I loved you, Mara.

01:33:57.719 --> 01:33:59.721
I did.

01:34:04.160 --> 01:34:07.467
All right, so you're going
to tell Amina the truth.

01:34:07.511 --> 01:34:09.948
You're going to tell her
that it was your fault...

01:34:09.992 --> 01:34:13.038
...if she hasn't had a mother to be there
for her this whole time.

01:34:13.996 --> 01:34:17.826
You're going to tell her everything
that I did to try to find her.

01:34:17.869 --> 01:34:20.176
You're going to beg for
her forgiveness...

01:34:20.219 --> 01:34:23.353
...and then you're going to help us
rebuild our lives together, okay?

01:34:28.097 --> 01:34:29.359
I will.

01:34:30.665 --> 01:34:32.492
This is not for you.

01:34:33.493 --> 01:34:34.712
This is for her.

01:34:48.639 --> 01:34:51.207
I understand what my daughter
needs.

01:34:54.645 --> 01:34:56.386
I always have.

01:35:10.574 --> 01:35:13.272
Amina, it's okay, I promise.

01:35:20.497 --> 01:35:22.151
Hey.

01:35:30.072 --> 01:35:31.638
Remember:...

01:35:32.596 --> 01:35:34.729
...I've always loved you.

01:35:46.436 --> 01:35:48.873
- Amina!
- Baba!
