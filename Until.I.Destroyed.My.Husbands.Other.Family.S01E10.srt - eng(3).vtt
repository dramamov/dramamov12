WEBVTT

00:00:08.174 --> 00:00:10.443
No matter how far I go

00:00:12.779 --> 00:00:14.748
or how hard I try to forget

00:00:17.183 --> 00:00:18.718
the sins I've committed

00:00:21.021 --> 00:00:23.857
might never go away.

00:00:40.774 --> 00:00:44.277
Is that Mr. Miyake's...

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:49.382
- She's my mother.
- What?

00:00:50.050 --> 00:00:53.486
Wow, I thought she was your sister.

00:00:55.121 --> 00:00:57.590
Thank you for all your support
for my son.

00:00:57.657 --> 00:00:59.359
Not at all.

00:00:59.459 --> 00:01:01.027
Wow...

00:01:06.399 --> 00:01:08.234
What are you doing?

00:01:10.537 --> 00:01:13.206
Walking made me so thirsty.

00:01:14.274 --> 00:01:17.610
Oh no! That's a really nice cafe

00:01:17.677 --> 00:01:19.412
but it's already closing.

00:01:19.479 --> 00:01:22.015
Oh, no, really?

00:01:24.217 --> 00:01:25.985
That's too bad.

00:01:28.922 --> 00:01:31.324
- Are you okay?
- What?

00:01:32.459 --> 00:01:35.528
You looked pale, so I was worried.

00:01:39.265 --> 00:01:40.567
Could it be...

00:01:41.868 --> 00:01:43.403
morning sickness?

00:01:44.771 --> 00:01:46.106
I wanted that woman

00:01:46.773 --> 00:01:50.176
to experience the same terror
I went through.

00:01:51.111 --> 00:01:53.313
Don't think this is the end.

00:01:54.581 --> 00:01:56.716
This is just the beginning.

00:01:56.783 --> 00:01:57.817
Let's go!

00:02:00.954 --> 00:02:02.055
Is this my turn

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:05.925
to be punished?

00:02:52.472 --> 00:02:57.443
UNTIL I DESTROYED
MY HUSBAND'S OTHER FAMILY

00:02:58.011 --> 00:02:59.579
Why did you come?

00:02:59.946 --> 00:03:01.748
What do you mean, why?

00:03:02.115 --> 00:03:05.018
I should be asking you
the same thing.

00:03:06.486 --> 00:03:10.557
Wataru, that cafe
belongs to that woman, right?

00:03:12.792 --> 00:03:14.594
Did you come to this town

00:03:15.228 --> 00:03:18.631
- because she's here?
- Of course not!

00:03:27.473 --> 00:03:29.909
Look at this article.

00:03:29.976 --> 00:03:32.345
A NEW CAFE OPENS.

00:03:32.412 --> 00:03:35.381
She opened the cafe two months ago.

00:03:35.448 --> 00:03:37.550
I was assigned here last year.

00:03:40.753 --> 00:03:43.356
You mean it's really a coincidence?

00:03:44.390 --> 00:03:46.726
If you don't want
to believe it, don't.

00:03:47.493 --> 00:03:50.330
But I was able
to get into Keiho University

00:03:50.396 --> 00:03:52.966
and become a teacher
all thanks to her.

00:03:53.032 --> 00:03:56.336
Stop it! Don't even say her name!

00:03:57.470 --> 00:03:59.739
It's just the past catching up.

00:04:00.873 --> 00:04:03.376
Blame your own actions,
not somebody else!

00:04:04.577 --> 00:04:08.214
That woman
wouldn't want to see us, either!

00:04:08.781 --> 00:04:11.517
Please don't come here anymore.

00:04:12.352 --> 00:04:13.386
What?

00:04:14.487 --> 00:04:15.822
It's a small town.

00:04:17.190 --> 00:04:19.292
People might get the wrong ideas.

00:04:21.527 --> 00:04:22.762
In any case

00:04:23.296 --> 00:04:26.499
stay away from that woman. Please!

00:04:27.834 --> 00:04:31.204
- I'll take care of the rest--
- Enough already!

00:04:32.672 --> 00:04:35.508
Stop sticking your nose
in my business.

00:04:37.043 --> 00:04:38.511
This is my life!

00:04:42.382 --> 00:04:44.350
Wait, Wataru!

00:04:47.654 --> 00:04:49.455
If you lay a hand on Minori

00:04:51.424 --> 00:04:53.826
I'll be done being your son.

00:05:11.544 --> 00:05:12.679
I apologize

00:05:13.313 --> 00:05:15.415
for what just happened.

00:05:19.252 --> 00:05:22.221
I never thought
my mother would show up.

00:05:23.623 --> 00:05:27.060
I'm sorry it was unpleasant.

00:05:28.961 --> 00:05:30.129
Don't worry.

00:05:31.130 --> 00:05:32.265
You can go.

00:05:41.941 --> 00:05:43.109
Seven years ago

00:05:45.244 --> 00:05:47.914
do you remember what you said to me?

00:05:50.783 --> 00:05:52.151
I want you

00:05:54.420 --> 00:05:56.456
to live your own life.

00:05:57.924 --> 00:05:59.325
During these years

00:06:00.426 --> 00:06:02.895
I couldn't live my own life.

00:06:04.831 --> 00:06:05.865
So

00:06:07.867 --> 00:06:09.335
I came to this town

00:06:11.070 --> 00:06:12.638
to make a fresh start.

00:06:15.675 --> 00:06:16.976
What do you mean?

00:06:19.278 --> 00:06:21.314
After you left Tokyo

00:06:22.782 --> 00:06:23.816
I...

00:06:24.951 --> 00:06:26.953
chose to be my sister's father

00:06:27.887 --> 00:06:31.190
and carried the weight
of our mother's sins with her.

00:06:32.892 --> 00:06:34.127
Here, Reika.

00:06:34.193 --> 00:06:35.661
I'm home!

00:06:35.728 --> 00:06:38.398
- Sorry I'm late!
- It's okay.

00:06:38.464 --> 00:06:40.833
Okay, I'm heading to cram school.

00:06:41.467 --> 00:06:42.802
Thank you.

00:06:42.869 --> 00:06:48.908
Your brother's so nice, isn't he?

00:06:48.975 --> 00:06:51.010
- Oh, the bath is ready.
- Thanks.

00:06:51.077 --> 00:06:52.545
Both my mom and I

00:06:53.479 --> 00:06:55.348
handled the house and the baby.

00:06:55.615 --> 00:06:56.749
- See you.
- Bye.

00:06:56.816 --> 00:06:57.950
But

00:06:58.785 --> 00:07:00.820
my mom had only me to rely on.

00:07:02.155 --> 00:07:03.356
She gradually...

00:07:08.494 --> 00:07:10.596
Goodbye, Mr. Miyake, Miss Muto.

00:07:10.663 --> 00:07:12.131
Bye-bye.

00:07:12.198 --> 00:07:13.900
- Bye.
- Take care.

00:07:20.807 --> 00:07:24.177
Are you guys dating?

00:07:27.380 --> 00:07:29.248
No, we just work together.

00:07:29.382 --> 00:07:30.516
Are you sure?

00:07:32.652 --> 00:07:34.353
I have a boyfriend.

00:07:35.288 --> 00:07:36.556
Goodbye.

00:07:38.758 --> 00:07:40.393
What's up with your mom?

00:07:41.027 --> 00:07:42.028
See you.

00:07:44.363 --> 00:07:46.933
Stop spying on me!

00:07:47.934 --> 00:07:50.803
- I'm not spying on you.
- You are!

00:07:50.870 --> 00:07:54.340
Calling my college and contacting
my friends on your own.

00:07:54.407 --> 00:07:55.808
This is not normal.

00:07:58.878 --> 00:08:00.246
Not normal?

00:08:03.883 --> 00:08:04.917
Sorry.

00:08:06.018 --> 00:08:07.186
I went too far.

00:08:07.720 --> 00:08:10.022
Why are you talking like that?

00:08:10.990 --> 00:08:13.125
You made me choose

00:08:13.659 --> 00:08:16.128
so I chose you!

00:08:16.896 --> 00:08:19.999
You and Reika are all I have.

00:08:20.833 --> 00:08:22.735
So what else can I do?

00:08:25.171 --> 00:08:27.707
I knew we'd both end up worse.

00:08:29.375 --> 00:08:31.644
So I left home and came here.

00:08:34.146 --> 00:08:35.414
But maybe

00:08:38.451 --> 00:08:39.619
all I did was

00:08:41.754 --> 00:08:43.823
ran from it all.

00:08:52.131 --> 00:08:53.366
I'm sorry.

00:08:55.768 --> 00:08:57.770
Why are you apologizing?

00:08:58.571 --> 00:08:59.572
Because

00:09:01.073 --> 00:09:03.142
you did nothing wrong.

00:09:05.144 --> 00:09:07.213
If only I had not involved you

00:09:08.314 --> 00:09:09.682
your life would've been

00:09:10.917 --> 00:09:13.519
completely different.

00:09:17.823 --> 00:09:19.058
But then

00:09:20.660 --> 00:09:22.828
I wouldn't have met you.

00:09:26.532 --> 00:09:27.733
Right now

00:09:29.702 --> 00:09:32.638
I'm finally living my own life.

00:09:36.709 --> 00:09:37.944
And I was able

00:09:39.812 --> 00:09:42.281
to find you again.

00:09:54.460 --> 00:09:55.528
Stop.

00:09:59.231 --> 00:10:00.366
Minori.

00:10:09.141 --> 00:10:10.476
The truth is

00:10:12.845 --> 00:10:14.246
I still love you.

00:10:16.215 --> 00:10:17.350
Don't.

00:10:22.722 --> 00:10:23.956
Do you remember

00:10:25.958 --> 00:10:28.294
our promise?

00:10:30.997 --> 00:10:33.366
The first time we went to the beach.

00:10:35.167 --> 00:10:36.268
That promise.

00:10:36.936 --> 00:10:39.905
Take me to the Kanagawa Aquarium
next time.

00:10:42.174 --> 00:10:45.544
If I get an A
on the Keiho practice test.

00:10:47.046 --> 00:10:48.214
Go for it.

00:10:56.422 --> 00:10:57.523
After that

00:10:59.058 --> 00:11:00.793
I got an A

00:11:02.528 --> 00:11:04.563
and I got into Keiho.

00:11:11.904 --> 00:11:13.506
Please, just once

00:11:16.042 --> 00:11:17.710
see me as a man.

00:11:44.336 --> 00:11:45.504
I'll wait for you

00:11:46.639 --> 00:11:48.474
at the bus stop

00:11:49.442 --> 00:11:51.110
at 11 a.m. this weekend.

00:11:54.346 --> 00:11:55.381
See you then.

00:12:38.758 --> 00:12:39.859
I'm home.

00:12:42.161 --> 00:12:43.763
I got some food.

00:12:58.511 --> 00:13:03.582
Mom, can't you get a job?
Money's really tight this month.

00:13:12.658 --> 00:13:15.094
Or do something around the house,
at least.

00:13:15.161 --> 00:13:17.029
God damn it.

00:13:38.551 --> 00:13:40.519
You're living with you mother.

00:13:41.387 --> 00:13:42.454
Yeah.

00:13:43.923 --> 00:13:48.294
She's not really sick
but she's been holed up at home.

00:13:48.961 --> 00:13:51.864
She doesn't even talk.

00:13:57.269 --> 00:13:58.337
I'm sorry!

00:14:05.911 --> 00:14:08.247
This is about
the child support, right?

00:14:08.314 --> 00:14:10.749
Give me a little more time.

00:14:10.816 --> 00:14:13.552
I'm really strapped for cash
this month.

00:14:20.593 --> 00:14:21.660
Look.

00:14:22.361 --> 00:14:24.530
Are you really okay with this?

00:14:26.932 --> 00:14:28.000
What?

00:14:32.171 --> 00:14:34.540
If you help me...

00:14:40.779 --> 00:14:44.016
I might reconsider the child support.

00:14:55.594 --> 00:14:58.230
Help you? How?

00:15:03.469 --> 00:15:04.737
That woman

00:15:06.372 --> 00:15:08.207
your ex-wife.

00:15:09.041 --> 00:15:11.343
She might be making a move on Wataru.

00:15:12.378 --> 00:15:13.445
What?

00:15:15.014 --> 00:15:17.116
Wataru says it's a coincidence.

00:15:18.050 --> 00:15:22.421
But they are living
in the same town now.

00:15:23.055 --> 00:15:24.056
What?

00:15:28.327 --> 00:15:29.795
They must have

00:15:31.397 --> 00:15:33.599
kept in touch all these years.

00:15:36.702 --> 00:15:38.771
Minori and Wataru?

00:15:43.442 --> 00:15:46.278
Must be nice being so clueless.

00:15:51.650 --> 00:15:54.186
Back then, Wataru was a minor.

00:15:55.521 --> 00:15:57.589
But he's an adult now.

00:15:59.258 --> 00:16:00.392
They can't be...

00:16:02.194 --> 00:16:03.228
Hey

00:16:04.897 --> 00:16:06.832
do you think you could handle it

00:16:07.466 --> 00:16:09.134
if those two hooked up?

00:16:09.802 --> 00:16:14.073
Your ex-wife and my son!

00:16:18.177 --> 00:16:20.446
I've been struggling to survive

00:16:22.047 --> 00:16:24.984
for my kids for the past seven years.

00:16:28.687 --> 00:16:31.457
If she takes
what matters most to me...

00:16:34.460 --> 00:16:36.862
just killing her won't be enough.

00:16:42.701 --> 00:16:45.904
CAFE GARDEN

00:16:57.383 --> 00:16:59.885
Leaving? Have a good one.

00:17:00.753 --> 00:17:04.590
Yeah, you, too. Are you going out?

00:17:05.724 --> 00:17:06.725
What?

00:17:08.227 --> 00:17:09.728
See you later.

00:17:12.698 --> 00:17:13.932
Have fun!

00:17:43.295 --> 00:17:45.097
What am I doing?

00:17:49.001 --> 00:17:52.971
BOUND FOR AQUARIUM

00:17:56.241 --> 00:17:57.476
Good morning.

00:17:59.011 --> 00:18:00.112
Hi.

00:18:02.781 --> 00:18:05.651
Thank you for coming.

00:18:11.090 --> 00:18:12.224
Sorry.

00:18:13.892 --> 00:18:15.794
I wanted to tell you in person.

00:18:19.031 --> 00:18:22.267
I made that promise back then

00:18:22.334 --> 00:18:25.037
because I needed to use you.

00:18:26.071 --> 00:18:28.006
So go with someone else.

00:18:28.073 --> 00:18:31.810
AQUARIUM ADMISSION TICKET

00:18:34.580 --> 00:18:35.948
And

00:18:38.450 --> 00:18:40.085
about the other day...

00:18:43.789 --> 00:18:48.193
Even if I saw you as a man,
it would never work.

00:18:49.995 --> 00:18:51.230
I'm sure

00:18:52.030 --> 00:18:54.933
you'll have lots of amazing love
ahead, so

00:18:56.368 --> 00:18:57.903
go find someone special.

00:19:02.374 --> 00:19:03.675
The one I love...

00:19:05.344 --> 00:19:07.312
it's always been the same.

00:19:14.219 --> 00:19:15.387
I'm sorry.

00:19:47.686 --> 00:19:52.858
The relationship between X and Y

00:19:52.925 --> 00:19:54.660
is proportional I think.

00:19:54.726 --> 00:19:55.727
Hey.

00:19:56.995 --> 00:19:58.263
Where's your mom?

00:20:05.771 --> 00:20:07.506
She's not on a date.

00:20:11.076 --> 00:20:13.378
Hey, what if

00:20:13.946 --> 00:20:17.516
my dad marries your mom?

00:20:18.150 --> 00:20:19.685
We'll be siblings.

00:20:24.189 --> 00:20:25.891
Oh, it's raining.

00:20:43.408 --> 00:20:44.876
We should be okay here.

00:20:53.318 --> 00:20:54.686
You got soaked.

00:20:58.390 --> 00:20:59.691
I'm fine.

00:21:07.633 --> 00:21:08.934
You are

00:21:10.469 --> 00:21:11.870
always like that.

00:21:12.804 --> 00:21:13.872
Like what?

00:21:15.140 --> 00:21:16.875
I must have been a nuisance

00:21:19.144 --> 00:21:20.379
but you were kind.

00:21:21.747 --> 00:21:22.914
There.

00:21:31.323 --> 00:21:32.924
I hope it'll stop soon.

00:21:36.461 --> 00:21:37.529
I...

00:21:39.798 --> 00:21:41.466
don't want it to stop.

00:21:56.214 --> 00:22:01.653
The other day, Haruna was
speaking very highly of you.

00:22:05.757 --> 00:22:07.526
It's thanks to you, Minori.

00:22:13.665 --> 00:22:15.133
Back then

00:22:16.768 --> 00:22:19.838
I was the worst,
clueless about others' feelings.

00:22:21.873 --> 00:22:23.342
Is it really that bad?

00:22:24.209 --> 00:22:25.644
That wrong?

00:22:27.346 --> 00:22:28.580
I don't like people

00:22:31.249 --> 00:22:33.985
who justify infidelity.

00:22:35.854 --> 00:22:37.255
You're the one

00:22:39.491 --> 00:22:41.293
who changed me.

00:22:49.334 --> 00:22:50.635
Minori

00:22:52.637 --> 00:22:54.506
I think you need me, too.

00:23:00.579 --> 00:23:01.780
Because I know

00:23:04.950 --> 00:23:06.451
we are the same.

00:23:09.554 --> 00:23:10.756
The same?

00:23:12.491 --> 00:23:13.759
We are

00:23:16.161 --> 00:23:19.464
still living with the pain
of hurting others.

00:23:25.971 --> 00:23:27.939
The one who cheated was to blame.

00:23:29.040 --> 00:23:30.675
No question about it.

00:23:33.545 --> 00:23:34.746
But even now

00:23:36.381 --> 00:23:38.750
you still carry feelings of guilt.

00:23:42.454 --> 00:23:43.855
That's not true.

00:23:47.859 --> 00:23:48.927
So...

00:23:51.363 --> 00:23:52.564
Minori.

00:23:55.534 --> 00:23:57.736
You don't have to bear

00:23:59.971 --> 00:24:01.873
the weight of the past alone.

00:24:05.310 --> 00:24:06.745
The two of us

00:24:08.747 --> 00:24:09.948
together

00:24:12.451 --> 00:24:13.885
can get through it.

00:24:28.166 --> 00:24:29.434
I love you.

00:24:33.271 --> 00:24:34.673
Minori.

00:24:37.542 --> 00:24:39.578
I'm hopelessly in love with you.

00:25:56.288 --> 00:25:57.355
Yes, hello.

00:25:59.124 --> 00:26:02.694
I'm sorry. Is this a bad time?

00:26:03.595 --> 00:26:04.696
No.

00:26:06.531 --> 00:26:08.400
Your son wants to talk to you.

00:26:12.404 --> 00:26:13.438
Mom?

00:26:15.273 --> 00:26:17.943
Did you take an umbrella?
Are you okay?

00:26:18.643 --> 00:26:19.644
Yeah.

00:26:20.579 --> 00:26:21.613
I'm fine.

00:26:22.914 --> 00:26:24.549
I think it's stopped.

00:26:25.784 --> 00:26:26.851
Good.

00:26:28.687 --> 00:26:30.822
That's all. See you later.

00:26:34.326 --> 00:26:35.427
Hi.

00:26:36.227 --> 00:26:38.163
Tsubasa was worried about you.

00:26:38.930 --> 00:26:40.131
Such a kind boy.

00:26:42.100 --> 00:26:44.235
Okay then. Take care.

00:27:00.485 --> 00:27:01.720
I'm sorry.

00:27:03.288 --> 00:27:04.923
I was not myself.

00:27:08.460 --> 00:27:11.496
I don't want to do anything

00:27:12.230 --> 00:27:15.634
that could hurt Tsubasa
or your sister.

00:27:18.737 --> 00:27:19.938
I'm sorry.

00:28:00.078 --> 00:28:02.947
I guess Mr. Miyake
is not coming today.

00:28:04.282 --> 00:28:06.751
- What?
- But you know

00:28:06.818 --> 00:28:09.220
Mr. Miyake is a big fan of Minori.

00:28:09.287 --> 00:28:11.589
I know!

00:28:13.058 --> 00:28:16.528
I saw you two together the other day.

00:28:19.964 --> 00:28:20.999
Where?

00:28:22.200 --> 00:28:26.438
He'll be shocked to find out
she's going out with Mr. Taguchi.

00:28:26.504 --> 00:28:28.173
I bet he will!

00:28:32.577 --> 00:28:35.714
Hi, Mr. Taguchi!
We weren't talking about you!

00:28:35.780 --> 00:28:36.815
What?

00:28:41.019 --> 00:28:43.455
Good luck to you both!

00:28:44.289 --> 00:28:46.191
Excuse us.

00:28:46.257 --> 00:28:47.559
See you later!

00:28:53.631 --> 00:28:54.733
Please come in.

00:28:57.135 --> 00:28:58.203
Minori.

00:29:00.171 --> 00:29:01.272
I actually

00:29:03.408 --> 00:29:04.909
saw you two together.

00:29:06.311 --> 00:29:07.579
The truth is

00:29:08.446 --> 00:29:09.881
I still love you.

00:29:17.088 --> 00:29:18.823
I'm not telling anybody.

00:29:21.226 --> 00:29:22.360
But it's just...

00:29:24.429 --> 00:29:28.133
What's the relationship
between you two, if you don't mind?

00:29:47.218 --> 00:29:48.319
Kume.

00:29:49.854 --> 00:29:50.989
What's up?

00:29:52.791 --> 00:29:54.626
I know

00:29:56.227 --> 00:29:58.029
about you and my mom.

00:30:00.598 --> 00:30:02.801
Are you going out with Mr. Taguchi?

00:30:04.202 --> 00:30:07.672
- It's none of your business, is it?
- It is!

00:30:08.907 --> 00:30:12.143
- I've always--
- Mr. Miyake.

00:30:17.248 --> 00:30:18.416
Tsubasa.

00:30:23.254 --> 00:30:24.522
You heard us.

00:30:26.591 --> 00:30:30.395
Please stop hurting my mom!

00:30:33.264 --> 00:30:34.432
I don't want you

00:30:35.366 --> 00:30:37.302
to torment my mother any more.

00:30:39.404 --> 00:30:40.738
If you don't stop

00:30:41.372 --> 00:30:44.242
I'll do anything to protect my mom.

00:30:50.215 --> 00:30:52.317
I had no idea you and Mr. Miyake

00:30:53.284 --> 00:30:55.220
had such a complicated history.

00:30:57.856 --> 00:30:59.090
Mr. Miyake's sister

00:31:00.658 --> 00:31:02.760
is my son's

00:31:04.395 --> 00:31:05.797
half-sister.

00:31:08.199 --> 00:31:09.334
If they find out

00:31:09.934 --> 00:31:11.803
about each other now

00:31:13.471 --> 00:31:15.440
they might suffer.

00:31:19.844 --> 00:31:22.013
Nothing is more precious to me

00:31:23.581 --> 00:31:24.816
than Tsubasa.

00:31:27.452 --> 00:31:28.519
So

00:31:30.154 --> 00:31:32.857
nothing could ever happen

00:31:34.492 --> 00:31:35.727
between Mr. Miyake and me.

00:31:40.431 --> 00:31:42.033
You do love him

00:31:43.468 --> 00:31:44.702
don't you?

00:31:51.209 --> 00:31:52.744
It's too bad for me

00:31:56.114 --> 00:31:57.315
but I understand.

00:32:04.255 --> 00:32:05.323
Minori?

00:32:10.194 --> 00:32:12.597
Don't carry the guilt by yourself.

00:32:16.100 --> 00:32:18.269
We were both betrayed and suffered.

00:32:20.038 --> 00:32:22.240
I think we deserve to be happy.

00:32:24.709 --> 00:32:25.710
So please.

00:32:28.179 --> 00:32:30.114
I want you to be happy.

00:33:01.813 --> 00:33:04.582
TO MINORI KUME

00:33:19.230 --> 00:33:22.000
I KNOW ABOUT YOU AND WATARU MIYAKE.

00:33:22.066 --> 00:33:24.969
DO YOU REALLY THINK
YOU'LL BE FORGIVEN?

00:33:52.363 --> 00:33:57.668
MR. TAGUCHI

00:34:00.505 --> 00:34:01.639
Hello?

00:34:02.874 --> 00:34:04.375
Sorry to call you early.

00:34:05.143 --> 00:34:08.279
I forgot something there yesterday.

00:34:09.614 --> 00:34:10.648
I see.

00:34:11.282 --> 00:34:12.717
What did you forget?

00:34:17.321 --> 00:34:21.092
Who's suspicious of Wataru and me?

00:34:23.194 --> 00:34:24.262
Good morning!

00:34:26.464 --> 00:34:27.565
Sorry.

00:34:28.466 --> 00:34:29.901
Did I scare you?

00:34:32.270 --> 00:34:33.404
Good morning.

00:34:34.272 --> 00:34:36.707
Well, I'll come by later.

00:34:39.010 --> 00:34:40.278
See you.

00:34:46.417 --> 00:34:47.885
Yesterday, she said...

00:34:48.820 --> 00:34:52.423
I saw you two together the other day.

00:34:56.227 --> 00:34:57.328
She can't be...

00:34:58.396 --> 00:34:59.730
Haruna?

00:35:00.264 --> 00:35:01.466
Mom!

00:35:04.569 --> 00:35:05.803
I'm leaving.

00:35:09.607 --> 00:35:10.775
See you later.

00:35:11.776 --> 00:35:14.045
I'll see you at school.

00:35:14.112 --> 00:35:15.279
Take care.

00:35:17.715 --> 00:35:19.283
WATARU

00:35:22.253 --> 00:35:24.088
That's not possible.

00:35:50.314 --> 00:35:52.817
FORGIVE

00:36:21.212 --> 00:36:22.380
Yes, hello?

00:36:22.947 --> 00:36:24.649
This is Cafe Garden.

00:36:31.322 --> 00:36:32.456
Hello?

00:36:33.658 --> 00:36:34.792
Hello?

00:36:39.931 --> 00:36:41.165
What's wrong?

00:36:42.466 --> 00:36:44.569
KNOW

00:36:45.703 --> 00:36:47.205
You look so pale.

00:36:51.809 --> 00:36:58.115
Do you think you'll be forgiven?
I know about you and Wataru...

00:36:59.016 --> 00:37:01.085
You and Wataru Miyake.

00:37:01.152 --> 00:37:02.386
- I know.
- I know.

00:37:02.453 --> 00:37:04.222
You think you'll be forgiven?

00:37:16.200 --> 00:37:17.301
Minori!

00:37:17.835 --> 00:37:19.103
Are you okay?

00:37:22.440 --> 00:37:25.209
Minori! What's wrong?

00:37:36.387 --> 00:37:37.555
Do you think

00:37:38.823 --> 00:37:39.957
this might be me?

00:37:42.660 --> 00:37:43.794
You know

00:37:45.830 --> 00:37:48.165
I did find out your secret.

00:37:51.102 --> 00:37:52.370
But this!

00:37:56.474 --> 00:37:59.243
I'm not a coward.
I would never do this to you.

00:38:00.745 --> 00:38:01.912
Believe me.

00:38:27.171 --> 00:38:29.073
What happened
