WEBVTT

00:00:13.313 --> 00:00:14.714
There's no other way.

00:00:16.783 --> 00:00:17.784
What?

00:00:19.452 --> 00:00:20.620
Let's kill them.

00:00:24.958 --> 00:00:25.959
Yes.

00:00:27.627 --> 00:00:28.962
My husband

00:00:31.231 --> 00:00:32.465
and Yurika's, too.

00:00:35.068 --> 00:00:36.970
What are you two saying?

00:00:37.037 --> 00:00:39.906
Killing them is just...

00:00:42.976 --> 00:00:43.977
It'll be fine.

00:00:46.513 --> 00:00:48.114
I know we can pull it off.

00:00:51.651 --> 00:00:52.652
Yes.

00:00:53.553 --> 00:00:55.355
- After all--
- Wait.

00:01:00.827 --> 00:01:01.861
Stop.

00:01:04.731 --> 00:01:05.799
It's...

00:01:08.301 --> 00:01:09.669
not our first time

00:01:13.006 --> 00:01:14.207
killing someone.

00:01:38.565 --> 00:01:39.966
- That was...
- That was...

00:01:41.534 --> 00:01:42.669
Justice.

00:01:43.336 --> 00:01:44.671
Our justice.

00:03:13.459 --> 00:03:16.362
PLEASE DIE MY BELOVED

00:03:16.496 --> 00:03:19.199
- Still thirsty? One more round!
- Still thirsty? One more round!

00:03:19.265 --> 00:03:20.867
The three of us first met

00:03:20.934 --> 00:03:25.038
at a party we joined on a whim,
held by a club in college.

00:03:33.346 --> 00:03:34.948
Hey, here comes another girl!

00:03:39.852 --> 00:03:41.254
Is this spot open?

00:03:42.055 --> 00:03:43.189
Yes, go ahead.

00:03:46.292 --> 00:03:49.495
- I've never been to one of these.
- Me, too.

00:03:49.862 --> 00:03:52.599
I was hoping to make friends
by joining a club.

00:03:52.865 --> 00:03:55.702
Right? Me, too.

00:03:56.502 --> 00:03:58.304
Even if you're in college

00:03:58.905 --> 00:04:01.808
you can't meet anyone
if you just go to class.

00:04:02.709 --> 00:04:05.645
Yes, that's exactly right.

00:04:13.519 --> 00:04:14.954
Oh, fair lady.

00:04:15.855 --> 00:04:17.590
You are

00:04:18.725 --> 00:04:19.726
mine.

00:04:21.794 --> 00:04:22.895
So pretty.

00:04:33.339 --> 00:04:34.340
Well...

00:04:34.974 --> 00:04:36.643
This one's tasty.

00:04:36.743 --> 00:04:38.378
- Oh, really?
- Yes.

00:04:38.544 --> 00:04:39.646
Maybe I'll try one.

00:04:40.179 --> 00:04:41.447
- I'll take this one.
- Okay.

00:04:41.581 --> 00:04:43.149
I want to try one, too.

00:04:49.455 --> 00:04:50.456
So spicy.

00:04:50.957 --> 00:04:52.425
Isn't this spicy?

00:04:52.692 --> 00:04:55.261
Wait, this is good.
I'm on my second plate.

00:04:56.329 --> 00:04:57.330
It's so spicy.

00:04:57.397 --> 00:05:00.166
- Really?
- I'm impressed.

00:05:00.967 --> 00:05:03.803
Hey, can I have that Caesar salad?

00:05:04.003 --> 00:05:05.004
Okay.

00:05:05.938 --> 00:05:06.939
But wait.

00:05:07.674 --> 00:05:09.275
You're girls.

00:05:10.410 --> 00:05:13.079
You should read the room
and serve us first.

00:05:14.047 --> 00:05:15.915
You'll be crappy wives otherwise.

00:05:18.751 --> 00:05:19.986
You can have it all.

00:05:20.953 --> 00:05:23.956
Why do women have
to be the ones to serve the salad?

00:05:24.023 --> 00:05:25.158
Screw you!

00:05:25.858 --> 00:05:28.027
Seriously, so stupid!

00:05:28.227 --> 00:05:30.863
He looks like that
"you're mine" guy, too.

00:05:31.764 --> 00:05:34.133
They did look somewhat similar.

00:05:34.200 --> 00:05:36.502
- The resemblance is there.
- I have no words.

00:05:36.569 --> 00:05:38.304
He said, "You're mine," to the salad.

00:05:38.571 --> 00:05:40.540
- Seriously.
- It's not even funny.

00:05:41.341 --> 00:05:45.978
After that one night,
we became fast friends.

00:05:47.113 --> 00:05:51.417
A friendship that often forms
only when you're a student.

00:05:52.285 --> 00:05:54.721
And you grow apart once you graduate.

00:05:57.290 --> 00:05:58.658
That's what I thought.

00:06:00.059 --> 00:06:01.561
Until the incident.

00:06:08.401 --> 00:06:11.204
Couldn't we do something cooler
for our graduation trip?

00:06:11.270 --> 00:06:12.905
What? I like camping.

00:06:13.172 --> 00:06:17.276
We're going to be surrounded
by skyscrapers when we start working.

00:06:17.877 --> 00:06:20.513
We have to enjoy this nature
while we can.

00:06:20.580 --> 00:06:21.614
That's true.

00:06:23.549 --> 00:06:24.717
The air is so fresh.

00:06:25.084 --> 00:06:26.452
The CO2 is so fresh.

00:06:27.920 --> 00:06:29.722
- So fresh!
- The air is so fresh!

00:06:29.789 --> 00:06:30.890
The air is so fresh.

00:06:31.357 --> 00:06:32.658
It's so fresh!

00:06:33.926 --> 00:06:36.162
- Thank you!
- CO2 is wrong, isn't it?

00:06:36.229 --> 00:06:37.497
Be thankful, guys.

00:06:37.563 --> 00:06:39.298
- CO2? It's O2.
- It's O2.

00:06:39.599 --> 00:06:41.901
Yurika, that's so much stuff.

00:06:42.902 --> 00:06:45.037
Don't underestimate the mountain.
You'll die.

00:06:45.671 --> 00:06:46.672
What?

00:06:47.707 --> 00:06:49.909
- What's this for?
- In case of bears.

00:06:49.976 --> 00:06:51.310
- Gosh.
- And this?

00:06:51.377 --> 00:06:53.413
- For animals.
- And this?

00:06:53.579 --> 00:06:55.448
For if you fall into a lake.

00:06:56.149 --> 00:06:58.351
- And this?
- It seemed useful.

00:06:58.418 --> 00:07:00.686
- And this?
- I saw it in an anime.

00:07:00.953 --> 00:07:01.954
And this?

00:07:02.388 --> 00:07:04.924
Your toilet,
in case anything happens.

00:07:04.991 --> 00:07:05.992
What?

00:07:08.294 --> 00:07:11.431
Hey, there aren't any creeks.

00:07:11.497 --> 00:07:12.565
It's all trees.

00:07:12.632 --> 00:07:14.467
I think this way is north.

00:07:15.935 --> 00:07:17.036
It's raining.

00:07:17.437 --> 00:07:18.438
This sucks.

00:07:19.205 --> 00:07:20.840
- Isn't this the way west?
- What?

00:07:20.973 --> 00:07:23.009
- Why do you have a compass?
- It's north.

00:07:23.242 --> 00:07:25.011
- That's good to know.
- What's wrong?

00:07:25.244 --> 00:07:27.013
- Are you okay?
- Well...

00:07:27.079 --> 00:07:30.516
- Which way is north?
- Goodness, excuse me.

00:07:30.983 --> 00:07:34.821
Are there any creeks nearby
where we can set up camp?

00:07:36.289 --> 00:07:38.324
I think there's one that way.

00:07:42.728 --> 00:07:44.630
Oh, we're heading that way.

00:07:44.697 --> 00:07:45.898
Do you want to join us?

00:07:46.165 --> 00:07:47.166
What should we do?

00:07:47.600 --> 00:07:49.535
Yes, please. Thank you.

00:07:50.970 --> 00:07:52.004
This way.

00:07:52.538 --> 00:07:53.539
Thank you.

00:07:56.742 --> 00:07:59.412
It cleared up.
The weather up here's so fickle.

00:07:59.512 --> 00:08:00.613
Ready? Go!

00:08:01.380 --> 00:08:02.648
Oh, it worked.

00:08:02.715 --> 00:08:03.916
Thank goodness.

00:08:04.617 --> 00:08:07.186
I'm sorry for making you help
with our tent, too.

00:08:07.253 --> 00:08:09.121
- It's no problem.
- Thank you.

00:08:10.423 --> 00:08:11.591
If you're free

00:08:11.657 --> 00:08:13.726
want to have a barbecue with us?

00:08:14.360 --> 00:08:15.595
We brought some great meat.

00:08:16.796 --> 00:08:17.797
What should we do?

00:08:19.966 --> 00:08:20.967
Yes.

00:08:21.033 --> 00:08:22.034
We'll eat.

00:08:22.101 --> 00:08:23.669
- It's meat.
- Yurika!

00:08:23.736 --> 00:08:25.204
It's fine, isn't it?

00:08:26.205 --> 00:08:27.206
Please join us.

00:08:30.243 --> 00:08:31.711
- Okay.
- It's great quality.

00:08:34.480 --> 00:08:35.515
Marshmallows?

00:08:41.921 --> 00:08:43.523
You seem experienced.

00:08:43.890 --> 00:08:46.192
Oh, we love to go camping.

00:08:46.726 --> 00:08:48.060
Camping is one thing

00:08:48.127 --> 00:08:50.663
but you seem used to
calling out to girls.

00:08:51.163 --> 00:08:52.164
What?

00:08:52.632 --> 00:08:54.166
It's nothing.

00:08:56.302 --> 00:08:57.370
It's delicious.

00:08:58.671 --> 00:08:59.772
So good.

00:09:01.073 --> 00:09:02.942
Look. Aren't I good at grilling?

00:09:03.009 --> 00:09:04.977
Yes, it's perfectly grilled.

00:09:05.845 --> 00:09:07.113
Just for you.

00:09:07.780 --> 00:09:10.283
- Okay, thank you for the food.
- Eat up.

00:09:13.219 --> 00:09:14.220
It's tender.

00:09:17.256 --> 00:09:18.591
Yes, that's good.

00:09:21.127 --> 00:09:22.128
What is it?

00:09:23.563 --> 00:09:25.698
You look like a cute little animal.

00:09:25.865 --> 00:09:26.866
What?

00:09:27.133 --> 00:09:29.435
- Are you making fun of me?
- No, not at all.

00:09:32.171 --> 00:09:34.373
Yurika, same cut, okay?

00:09:34.440 --> 00:09:35.641
No, she's good.

00:09:35.708 --> 00:09:37.810
Her personality switches easily.

00:09:38.044 --> 00:09:39.045
What?

00:09:40.947 --> 00:09:42.982
Oshiro, I'm out of meat.

00:09:43.049 --> 00:09:45.184
See, like this.
Totally different person.

00:09:45.585 --> 00:09:47.386
It's empty.
What is the meaning of this?

00:09:47.453 --> 00:09:49.488
- I'm sorry, one second.
- Yurika.

00:09:49.555 --> 00:09:50.556
Stop that.

00:09:50.623 --> 00:09:52.024
- Oshiro?
- Come on.

00:09:52.458 --> 00:09:54.293
Here, eat some veggies. Thank you.

00:09:54.360 --> 00:09:55.361
Hello?

00:09:57.129 --> 00:09:58.931
Come on, do your job.

00:10:00.866 --> 00:10:03.803
Yes, it's all going as planned.

00:10:06.472 --> 00:10:08.874
I'm sorry,
the three of us are so loud.

00:10:09.375 --> 00:10:11.277
No, we're having fun, too.

00:10:14.747 --> 00:10:17.016
It's gotten chilly, hasn't it?

00:10:17.550 --> 00:10:19.385
Good thing
we bought more wood, right?

00:10:19.452 --> 00:10:20.786
Yes.

00:10:23.556 --> 00:10:24.557
Goodness.

00:10:38.638 --> 00:10:39.639
Well...

00:10:40.339 --> 00:10:41.374
When it's 1 a.m.

00:10:42.842 --> 00:10:44.877
can you come to the front gate?

00:10:47.546 --> 00:10:48.814
Let's stargaze together.

00:10:52.852 --> 00:10:54.854
Keep the scarf until then.

00:10:56.122 --> 00:10:57.123
Goodness.

00:11:02.762 --> 00:11:04.430
No luck over here.

00:11:05.097 --> 00:11:06.799
The tall one is acting cold

00:11:06.866 --> 00:11:09.168
and the glasses girl
is only interested in eating.

00:11:10.636 --> 00:11:11.637
You?

00:11:14.173 --> 00:11:15.908
The air is so fresh.

00:12:19.004 --> 00:12:21.240
Maya, thank you for coming.

00:12:22.541 --> 00:12:24.343
Thank you for lending me this.

00:12:25.010 --> 00:12:27.279
I know a secret place over there.

00:12:27.546 --> 00:12:28.547
Let's go.

00:12:29.582 --> 00:12:30.583
Okay.

00:12:52.838 --> 00:12:53.839
What?

00:12:54.807 --> 00:12:55.808
Hey.

00:12:56.675 --> 00:12:59.211
- Yurika.
- What?

00:12:59.545 --> 00:13:00.679
Maya is gone.

00:13:00.813 --> 00:13:02.181
Do you know where she went?

00:13:02.615 --> 00:13:04.650
Maybe the restroom.

00:13:05.618 --> 00:13:07.887
What? Let's go find her, Yurika.

00:13:08.487 --> 00:13:10.689
Okay, got it.

00:13:12.291 --> 00:13:14.460
Where are my glasses?

00:13:16.695 --> 00:13:18.864
There's a telescope in here.

00:13:19.031 --> 00:13:20.533
Can you help bring it out?

00:13:27.873 --> 00:13:28.874
What's wrong?

00:13:29.809 --> 00:13:30.810
Nothing.

00:13:32.912 --> 00:13:34.213
Oh, watch your step.

00:14:02.575 --> 00:14:03.576
No.

00:14:04.310 --> 00:14:05.377
Come on.

00:14:06.011 --> 00:14:07.046
Don't be like that.

00:14:08.647 --> 00:14:09.648
Just be normal.

00:14:19.892 --> 00:14:20.893
Strip.

00:14:23.062 --> 00:14:24.263
I'm sorry it's chilly.

00:14:34.073 --> 00:14:35.140
Let me think.

00:14:36.108 --> 00:14:37.877
How should I put this?

00:14:43.682 --> 00:14:44.884
You'd better listen to me.

00:14:52.258 --> 00:14:53.259
Hey!

00:14:54.193 --> 00:14:55.728
No, stop!

00:14:55.794 --> 00:14:57.062
Hands above your head!

00:14:57.129 --> 00:14:58.130
No!

00:14:59.665 --> 00:15:00.666
Stop!

00:15:01.033 --> 00:15:02.301
Maya?

00:15:05.170 --> 00:15:07.439
She wouldn't come this far.

00:15:07.706 --> 00:15:08.707
Yes, maybe.

00:15:10.976 --> 00:15:11.977
No!

00:15:13.545 --> 00:15:14.580
Stop!

00:15:16.649 --> 00:15:18.350
- Maya?
- No!

00:15:18.417 --> 00:15:20.185
No!

00:15:20.252 --> 00:15:21.487
Are you a virgin?

00:15:21.553 --> 00:15:23.622
Oh, my favorite!

00:15:26.425 --> 00:15:28.260
- No!
- Don't worry.

00:15:28.394 --> 00:15:31.330
You'll like it once you try it.

00:15:38.270 --> 00:15:39.271
Maya?

00:15:41.040 --> 00:15:42.174
You people...

00:15:43.008 --> 00:15:44.343
What are you doing?

00:15:46.278 --> 00:15:48.314
So annoying.

00:15:49.481 --> 00:15:52.151
- Wait!
- You're in my way!

00:15:52.384 --> 00:15:53.485
This is bullshit.

00:15:55.054 --> 00:15:56.922
Do you know how much you ate?

00:15:56.989 --> 00:15:58.357
That was expensive stuff.

00:16:03.395 --> 00:16:04.396
Hey.

00:16:04.964 --> 00:16:05.965
My glasses.

00:16:06.765 --> 00:16:08.667
Where are my glasses?

00:16:10.703 --> 00:16:11.704
Hey, you.

00:16:12.771 --> 00:16:16.542
You think a woman
can beat a man in a fight?

00:16:34.526 --> 00:16:35.794
I'm going to kill him.

00:16:38.230 --> 00:16:41.600
What the hell is wrong
with you damn women?

00:16:41.667 --> 00:16:42.668
I'll kill him.

00:17:10.062 --> 00:17:11.363
Is he dead?

00:17:14.099 --> 00:17:15.234
I don't know.

00:17:17.036 --> 00:17:21.006
But if he did, he deserved it.

00:17:24.176 --> 00:17:25.344
Yes.

00:17:26.345 --> 00:17:27.613
It was self-defense.

00:17:30.215 --> 00:17:32.317
First, let's call the police.

00:17:35.554 --> 00:17:36.555
Wait.

00:17:41.760 --> 00:17:43.429
I don't want anyone to know.

00:17:45.831 --> 00:17:46.832
That this...

00:17:48.534 --> 00:17:49.968
That this happened to me.

00:17:50.903 --> 00:17:53.572
I don't want anyone to know.

00:17:58.143 --> 00:18:00.612
Our lives were just getting started.

00:18:02.181 --> 00:18:03.348
Why...

00:18:04.750 --> 00:18:06.618
All because of a jerk like this.

00:18:59.638 --> 00:19:02.174
Ready? Push.

00:19:43.448 --> 00:19:44.483
I'm scared.

00:19:45.684 --> 00:19:48.887
But let's go check.

00:19:51.590 --> 00:19:53.025
Is he around here?

00:19:54.193 --> 00:19:56.195
I think so.

00:20:30.963 --> 00:20:32.264
He's dead.

00:20:33.899 --> 00:20:35.200
We killed him.

00:20:36.468 --> 00:20:37.803
We really did it.

00:20:56.855 --> 00:20:57.856
Back then

00:20:58.423 --> 00:21:02.060
we saw the newspapers call it
an accidental death.

00:21:07.666 --> 00:21:08.667
Just like with him

00:21:10.802 --> 00:21:11.970
I know it'll work.

00:21:15.874 --> 00:21:18.677
If the three of us work together.

00:21:39.331 --> 00:21:40.332
We did...

00:21:45.203 --> 00:21:46.571
the right thing, right?

00:21:50.676 --> 00:21:51.677
Yes.

00:22:12.130 --> 00:22:15.834
The person I loved

00:22:18.437 --> 00:22:22.207
Was a kind soul

00:22:23.342 --> 00:22:24.743
Singing at a time like this?

00:22:28.280 --> 00:22:34.686
- The happy things in life
- The happy things in life

00:22:36.388 --> 00:22:38.423
- Only grew in number
- Only grew in number

00:22:39.324 --> 00:22:40.792
Peace, peace

00:22:41.727 --> 00:22:45.230
- The person I cherished
- The person I cherished

00:22:46.865 --> 00:22:50.068
- Understood me
- Understood me

00:22:50.235 --> 00:22:51.470
- Peace
- Peace

00:22:52.237 --> 00:22:58.176
- They became moments that were
- They became moments that were

00:22:58.944 --> 00:23:02.080
- Full of emotion, that's all right
- Full of emotion, that's all right

00:23:42.287 --> 00:23:44.556
Peace!

00:23:45.290 --> 00:23:46.291
Peace!

00:23:47.292 --> 00:23:49.628
Maya, place to bury the body

00:23:49.694 --> 00:23:50.796
It was suffocating.

00:23:52.464 --> 00:23:54.499
The crime that we committed

00:23:54.933 --> 00:23:58.503
felt too heavy to accept.

00:24:00.305 --> 00:24:01.873
I kept telling myself excuses.

00:24:01.940 --> 00:24:03.141
Yurika, body disposal tools

00:24:08.180 --> 00:24:09.347
We are justice!

00:24:09.414 --> 00:24:10.649
Like a chant.

00:24:11.450 --> 00:24:12.517
Like a prayer.

00:24:15.020 --> 00:24:16.087
This is justice.

00:24:17.122 --> 00:24:18.390
That's what I told myself.

00:24:36.708 --> 00:24:37.809
For now

00:24:38.710 --> 00:24:39.911
let's make a toast.

00:24:41.213 --> 00:24:42.214
To what?

00:24:43.482 --> 00:24:45.951
That we survived another day.

00:24:46.518 --> 00:24:47.519
Right?

00:24:51.256 --> 00:24:52.257
Ready?

00:24:52.324 --> 00:24:53.925
- We survived another day.
- We survived another day.

00:24:55.794 --> 00:24:57.896
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

00:25:05.403 --> 00:25:06.404
That day

00:25:06.872 --> 00:25:09.941
we washed down our guilt
with the taste of lukewarm beer.

00:25:10.742 --> 00:25:12.811
Deep into our guts.

00:25:14.513 --> 00:25:15.547
Wait, hold on.

00:25:16.014 --> 00:25:17.015
What?

00:25:17.415 --> 00:25:19.618
- You can't drink.
- Why?

00:25:20.619 --> 00:25:21.720
Yes, you can't.

00:25:21.920 --> 00:25:23.522
- Absolutely not.
- Why?

00:25:23.655 --> 00:25:25.156
You're pregnant, aren't you?

00:25:25.724 --> 00:25:26.725
Oh, right.

00:25:27.792 --> 00:25:30.862
All that remains
is a strange sense of accomplishment.

00:25:30.929 --> 00:25:31.930
That's refreshing.

00:25:31.997 --> 00:25:36.301
And an unbreakable bond
that binds us three until death.

00:25:36.368 --> 00:25:37.936
I forgot to breathe.

00:25:38.270 --> 00:25:40.472
The three of us, bound together

00:25:40.939 --> 00:25:42.707
continued to carry this secret

00:25:44.042 --> 00:25:46.278
and caught a cold the next morning.

00:25:46.344 --> 00:25:49.247
- Hey, careful.
- Oh, no.

00:25:50.315 --> 00:25:51.316
There it is.

00:25:52.183 --> 00:25:54.619
In the end, there it is.

00:25:55.854 --> 00:25:58.189
Then give me some hot water.

00:25:58.723 --> 00:26:00.125
- Hot water?
- Yes.

00:26:00.525 --> 00:26:02.060
- That's what you want?
- Yes.

00:26:02.727 --> 00:26:04.396
- Come on, go get it.
- Wait.

00:26:04.563 --> 00:26:06.164
- Hold on.
- Hey, that's not fair.

00:26:06.231 --> 00:26:08.099
- Hey, relax.
- I am.

00:26:08.266 --> 00:26:09.267
No beer for you.

00:26:11.536 --> 00:26:13.405
- Cheers.
- What do I drink then?

00:26:13.471 --> 00:26:16.074
I'll get you hot water
at the perfect temperature.

00:26:16.141 --> 00:26:18.677
- Get it before you drink.
- Let us drink some first.

00:26:30.155 --> 00:26:31.823
What a long girls' night out.

00:26:33.992 --> 00:26:35.327
Let's go home.

00:26:36.161 --> 00:26:40.065
Mr. Shimura, the man with the nose
of a police dog, is wrong this time.

00:26:41.566 --> 00:26:42.567
They came out.

00:26:48.773 --> 00:26:50.642
Okay, let's stick with the plan.

00:26:51.376 --> 00:26:52.377
Yes.

00:26:52.744 --> 00:26:54.613
Thank you, you two.

00:26:56.081 --> 00:26:57.215
We're in this together.

00:26:58.416 --> 00:26:59.417
You too, Maya.

00:26:59.884 --> 00:27:01.653
Tell us if you're ever in trouble.

00:27:03.188 --> 00:27:05.423
- You're so cool.
- Hey.

00:27:06.291 --> 00:27:07.292
See you.

00:27:07.993 --> 00:27:09.728
- Let's go.
- Stay safe.

00:27:10.061 --> 00:27:11.596
You, too.

00:27:13.798 --> 00:27:15.533
Isn't this just a get-together?

00:27:16.368 --> 00:27:17.369
No.

00:27:18.870 --> 00:27:19.871
Something smells.

00:27:20.739 --> 00:27:23.475
Stop it
with the cliché detective lines.

00:27:25.076 --> 00:27:26.177
Are you hungry?

00:27:26.411 --> 00:27:28.413
I saw a ramen place on the way here.

00:27:28.480 --> 00:27:30.548
You like tonkotsu ramen, right?

00:27:30.715 --> 00:27:32.017
No, you like iekei ramen.

00:27:52.570 --> 00:27:54.339
The three of us have no choice

00:27:54.839 --> 00:27:56.007
but to just do it.

00:27:58.643 --> 00:28:00.111
That's hot!

00:28:00.178 --> 00:28:01.446
Oh, crap.

00:28:02.947 --> 00:28:04.749
GUNASHIRU

00:28:05.283 --> 00:28:07.085
Limit contact to only calls.

00:28:07.552 --> 00:28:09.320
When you send texts

00:28:09.788 --> 00:28:11.056
use Gunashiru.

00:28:19.064 --> 00:28:22.767
Isn't Gunashiru the app
they use for shady part-time jobs?

00:28:23.034 --> 00:28:25.503
Yes, it won't leave any traces.

00:28:28.740 --> 00:28:31.176
It's like we're real criminals!

00:28:35.246 --> 00:28:36.247
I'm sorry.

00:28:39.217 --> 00:28:40.218
And then?

00:28:40.885 --> 00:28:43.621
First, get our husbands' guards down.

00:28:44.255 --> 00:28:45.256
Really?

00:28:45.924 --> 00:28:50.028
Yes, Maya and Riko found ways
to get the settlement money.

00:28:50.795 --> 00:28:52.464
Can they really pay 30 million?

00:28:53.498 --> 00:28:56.668
They're liquidating their stocks
and insurance policies

00:28:56.735 --> 00:29:00.071
so it'll take some time,
but definitely by the deadline.

00:29:05.110 --> 00:29:06.778
I don't believe you.

00:29:21.059 --> 00:29:22.227
Please accept this.

00:29:28.433 --> 00:29:32.637
Maya and I will pull together money
to win his trust.

00:29:33.204 --> 00:29:35.106
I guess it's like a deposit.

00:29:35.573 --> 00:29:36.875
This is it for now.

00:29:37.876 --> 00:29:39.611
Yurika's acting will seal the deal.

00:29:40.345 --> 00:29:44.115
I'm sorry,
that's all I have right now.

00:29:45.617 --> 00:29:48.853
Please, believe me.

00:29:56.795 --> 00:29:58.096
I guess it can't be helped.

00:29:59.197 --> 00:30:00.198
This will do.

00:30:20.351 --> 00:30:23.121
And I'll get the medication.

00:30:23.288 --> 00:30:24.389
Sleeping drugs?

00:30:26.758 --> 00:30:28.459
I have trouble sleeping.

00:30:29.494 --> 00:30:30.495
Please.

00:30:36.434 --> 00:30:37.435
Okay.

00:30:46.878 --> 00:30:49.147
Maya, find a place to bury Garbie.

00:31:13.071 --> 00:31:14.505
Maya.

00:31:14.739 --> 00:31:16.307
There you are.

00:31:16.374 --> 00:31:17.508
The meeting's starting.

00:31:17.575 --> 00:31:19.510
- I'm sorry, I'll be right there.
- Okay.

00:31:26.150 --> 00:31:29.220
Then those are the people
who will take over.

00:31:30.388 --> 00:31:33.291
Thank you, and I apologize
for the inconvenience.

00:31:33.725 --> 00:31:34.959
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

00:31:35.193 --> 00:31:36.494
Let's end here.

00:31:36.561 --> 00:31:37.595
- Okay.
- Okay.

00:31:37.829 --> 00:31:38.830
Thank you.

00:31:45.737 --> 00:31:46.804
I'm sad to see you go.

00:31:48.006 --> 00:31:50.041
You were the only woman
left in our cohort.

00:31:50.708 --> 00:31:51.709
I'm sorry.

00:31:52.143 --> 00:31:53.811
But Katsuta Holdings?

00:31:53.978 --> 00:31:55.213
What a career boost.

00:31:58.650 --> 00:32:00.251
YUTO TAKAGI

00:32:01.653 --> 00:32:02.720
I'm sorry, one second.

00:32:11.963 --> 00:32:12.964
Hello?

00:32:13.464 --> 00:32:14.766
What is it, Mr. Takagi?

00:32:15.867 --> 00:32:16.901
Really?

00:32:18.169 --> 00:32:19.771
Ryosuke got them for me.

00:32:21.739 --> 00:32:22.774
Thank you.

00:32:24.175 --> 00:32:25.343
I'll bring them now.

00:32:26.511 --> 00:32:30.114
I just mix it in his alcohol, right?

00:32:31.716 --> 00:32:34.585
And when he feels faint, thud.

00:32:37.956 --> 00:32:39.190
Thud.

00:32:44.495 --> 00:32:46.030
I wonder how Maya is doing.

00:32:52.470 --> 00:32:54.372
She hasn't read our texts.

00:32:55.707 --> 00:32:56.874
I wonder if she's okay.

00:33:01.946 --> 00:33:04.482
RIKO

00:33:12.523 --> 00:33:15.059
Please forget this offer
ever happened.

00:33:16.027 --> 00:33:17.028
What?

00:33:17.161 --> 00:33:20.798
We'd like to cancel
the offer from Katsuta Holdings.

00:33:21.933 --> 00:33:23.167
No way...

00:33:24.302 --> 00:33:27.405
But I already quit my other job.

00:33:27.605 --> 00:33:30.008
- How could you?
- No, how could you?

00:33:30.475 --> 00:33:31.476
What?

00:33:31.542 --> 00:33:33.845
You were hiding something,
weren't you?

00:33:37.215 --> 00:33:38.483
What do you mean?

00:33:39.917 --> 00:33:43.087
It seems your husband got
into an incident and disappeared.

00:33:45.790 --> 00:33:46.791
That's...

00:33:50.395 --> 00:33:51.596
So it's true.

00:33:53.364 --> 00:33:54.432
We got an email.

00:33:55.633 --> 00:33:56.634
An email?

00:33:58.269 --> 00:34:01.239
- Who would do that?
- We can't divulge their identity.

00:34:01.873 --> 00:34:04.542
But when you said
he supports you getting a new job

00:34:04.842 --> 00:34:06.778
it was all a lie, correct?

00:34:08.279 --> 00:34:09.981
He's irrelevant here.

00:34:10.982 --> 00:34:14.152
This is a very big breach of trust.

00:34:15.520 --> 00:34:18.156
And with your current family troubles

00:34:18.589 --> 00:34:21.492
we doubt you will perform adequately.

00:34:24.262 --> 00:34:25.263
This can't be...

00:34:29.267 --> 00:34:30.301
It's unfortunate.

00:35:14.178 --> 00:35:15.179
Everything...

00:35:18.616 --> 00:35:20.418
Everything is his fault.

00:35:42.907 --> 00:35:45.910
A FRIEND HAS LOGGED IN

00:36:07.965 --> 00:36:11.903
A FRIEND HAS LOGGED IN

00:36:26.484 --> 00:36:29.554
Thank you for before, Mitsuhiro.
Can you play until morning again?

00:36:29.620 --> 00:36:32.023
I want to reach level 59.

00:36:50.508 --> 00:36:55.880
Who are you?

00:36:55.947 --> 00:36:58.649
Is this Maya?

00:37:14.699 --> 00:37:16.801
Gaming is the only time
I can forget reality

00:37:16.867 --> 00:37:17.969
I know, right?

00:37:33.017 --> 00:37:34.018
Why?

00:37:35.086 --> 00:37:36.988
Why is Mitsuhiro talking to him?

00:37:49.867 --> 00:37:51.836
I'm Yuna, four years old.

00:37:51.902 --> 00:37:52.903
THEIR TRUE COLORS

00:37:52.970 --> 00:37:58.209
My favorite foods are gummies,
barbecue, and muscat grapes.

00:37:58.776 --> 00:38:02.580
I like drawing
and having books read to me.

00:38:03.347 --> 00:38:05.416
- Next week--
- No, you can't.

00:38:05.516 --> 00:38:06.951
Don't say the title.

00:38:07.218 --> 00:38:09.654
I can't stop thinking
about this trio.

00:38:09.720 --> 00:38:11.689
That's just who you are!

00:38:11.756 --> 00:38:13.924
- Hypocrite.
- What's so funny?

00:38:13.991 --> 00:38:16.527
I've watched over you
this whole time.

00:38:16.594 --> 00:38:18.429
- Even as a kid.
- Don't be creepy.

00:38:18.496 --> 00:38:20.097
You're my wife, aren't you?

00:38:20.264 --> 00:38:22.733
Next week, "Our True Identity."

00:38:23.134 --> 00:38:25.336
Tune in next week!

00:38:25.936 --> 00:38:27.805
Mitsuhiro's affair was with...
