00:00:13.013 --> 00:00:15.181
What's this uneasy feeling?

00:00:18.218 --> 00:00:20.053
Your turn for the bath, Wataru.

00:00:20.620 --> 00:00:21.821
Can't you knock?

00:00:21.888 --> 00:00:23.023
Sorry.

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:26.693
He never used to be so secretive.

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:27.794
I'll take a bath.

00:00:27.861 --> 00:00:30.296
Does he have something to hide?

00:00:31.164 --> 00:00:32.665
SURE. WHERE DO U WANT TO GO?

00:00:32.732 --> 00:00:33.733
K. M.?

00:00:35.502 --> 00:00:36.669
No, it can't be.

00:00:39.639 --> 00:00:41.307
Kisaragi Minori?

00:00:44.377 --> 00:00:45.745
You're K. M.?

00:00:46.446 --> 00:00:47.781
I'm glad to meet you.

00:00:48.248 --> 00:00:49.649
Me too.

00:00:50.350 --> 00:00:55.722
Because I can take the most
precious thing from your mother.

00:00:56.389 --> 00:00:57.657
My mother?

00:00:58.658 --> 00:01:00.226
The most precious thing?

00:01:00.827 --> 00:01:03.430
Yes. Do you know what that is?

00:01:05.432 --> 00:01:07.734
Her dearest

00:01:08.835 --> 00:01:10.036
son.

00:01:16.743 --> 00:01:18.878
No way she'd actually go that far...

00:01:21.781 --> 00:01:23.116
No.

00:01:24.017 --> 00:01:28.254
High schoolers are naturally
interested in romance.

00:01:28.321 --> 00:01:31.825
Oh, not mine.
He doesn't seem interested.

00:01:31.958 --> 00:01:34.994
It's the ones who seem uninterested,
you never know.

00:01:35.428 --> 00:01:36.463
What?

00:01:44.637 --> 00:01:46.005
I'll teach you

00:01:46.873 --> 00:01:49.042
- about the adult world.
- What?

00:01:56.916 --> 00:01:58.885
She might actually do that.

00:02:00.220 --> 00:02:02.555
Please! Let me make it in time.

00:02:03.690 --> 00:02:05.058
Got something on you.

00:03:08.888 --> 00:03:14.227
UNTIL I DESTROYED MY HUSBAND'S
OTHER FAMILY

00:03:27.240 --> 00:03:28.408
Wataru.

00:03:33.379 --> 00:03:34.614
I'm sorry.

00:03:39.319 --> 00:03:43.122
Ms. Kume, what made you start
playing Anko Panic?

00:03:43.790 --> 00:03:45.124
What made me?

00:03:45.191 --> 00:03:47.660
You don't know much about games.

00:03:47.727 --> 00:03:50.930
There are more popular games.
Why this?

00:03:52.232 --> 00:03:53.266
I see.

00:03:55.268 --> 00:03:58.204
I've always liked aquariums.

00:04:03.343 --> 00:04:05.345
But I heard you played it.

00:04:07.714 --> 00:04:08.715
Because

00:04:10.116 --> 00:04:12.385
I needed to get close to you.

00:04:13.453 --> 00:04:14.654
I wanted to know

00:04:15.822 --> 00:04:17.156
more about you.

00:04:20.493 --> 00:04:23.696
It's a tutor's job
to know about the students.

00:04:27.967 --> 00:04:29.235
I see.

00:04:30.937 --> 00:04:32.705
You wanted a different reason?

00:04:38.411 --> 00:04:41.648
You said you liked aquariums.

00:04:41.981 --> 00:04:44.951
Yes, I love dolphins.

00:04:45.952 --> 00:04:48.588
The Kanagawa Aquarium then.

00:04:49.222 --> 00:04:50.223
What?

00:04:52.592 --> 00:04:53.993
The next reward.

00:04:54.694 --> 00:04:57.630
Take me to the Kanagawa Aquarium
next time.

00:04:59.999 --> 00:05:03.269
If I get an A
on the Keio practice test.

00:05:04.637 --> 00:05:05.672
Go for it.

00:05:07.240 --> 00:05:10.977
Next time we meet,
no talk about the cram school.

00:05:14.847 --> 00:05:15.948
Okay.

00:05:19.452 --> 00:05:20.553
Well then.

00:05:24.490 --> 00:05:25.625
Pinky swear.

00:05:34.701 --> 00:05:37.970
Cross my heart and hope to die

00:05:39.238 --> 00:05:40.907
Stick a needle in my eye

00:05:47.947 --> 00:05:51.617
The Tsukishiro group's stock price
reached 120% year-on-year

00:05:51.851 --> 00:05:55.588
while sales achieved 160%.

00:05:55.722 --> 00:05:59.525
The highest numbers ever.

00:06:01.160 --> 00:06:04.697
Tsubasa, can you play
with something else?

00:06:04.764 --> 00:06:06.366
Why?

00:06:06.432 --> 00:06:10.703
Here, the dinosaurs from Grandma.

00:06:12.939 --> 00:06:15.241
Mom bought these for me.

00:06:15.842 --> 00:06:18.644
Did she? Well, it doesn't matter.

00:06:18.711 --> 00:06:20.613
Dad is busy right now.

00:06:23.649 --> 00:06:25.284
When is Mom coming home?

00:06:25.351 --> 00:06:27.387
In the evening, I guess.

00:06:27.453 --> 00:06:30.990
No! I want to go to the park
with Mom.

00:06:31.057 --> 00:06:32.992
I'll take you after I watch this.

00:06:33.059 --> 00:06:34.627
No! I want Mom!

00:06:34.694 --> 00:06:38.331
Don't say that.
You're going to make Dad cry.

00:06:39.165 --> 00:06:40.800
Like Mom?

00:06:42.802 --> 00:06:43.970
What?

00:06:44.036 --> 00:06:46.372
Mom's always crying.

00:06:46.439 --> 00:06:49.776
She says,
"Sorry, Tsubasa. Everything's okay."

00:06:50.810 --> 00:06:52.645
Why is she crying?

00:06:53.379 --> 00:06:55.415
It's all your fault.

00:07:03.756 --> 00:07:06.259
Haven't been to the beach in ages.
Feels great!

00:07:06.325 --> 00:07:07.360
Me too!

00:07:08.995 --> 00:07:10.196
Now,

00:07:11.330 --> 00:07:14.033
you can tell me all about your mother

00:07:14.834 --> 00:07:16.235
and Yudai.

00:07:17.437 --> 00:07:18.471
Hey

00:07:19.138 --> 00:07:21.073
why did you ask me out today?

00:07:21.707 --> 00:07:24.210
Anything you wanted to tell me?

00:07:25.144 --> 00:07:26.846
The last time I saw you...

00:07:27.780 --> 00:07:29.816
Aren't they getting married?

00:07:31.184 --> 00:07:32.785
The man who's like your father

00:07:33.719 --> 00:07:34.887
and your mother?

00:07:38.758 --> 00:07:40.726
Since they are having a baby

00:07:41.461 --> 00:07:44.163
I think they are planning to.

00:07:47.967 --> 00:07:49.068
Ms. Kume?

00:07:54.841 --> 00:07:56.776
You seemed a bit off.

00:07:58.511 --> 00:08:00.913
So I was wondering what was wrong.

00:08:03.449 --> 00:08:04.684
It's just

00:08:05.551 --> 00:08:08.488
changes at home before exams
can be tough.

00:08:08.554 --> 00:08:11.123
I was wondering
how I could support you.

00:08:15.862 --> 00:08:18.264
I appreciate it.

00:08:25.872 --> 00:08:28.107
Any specifics about their marriage?

00:08:31.344 --> 00:08:32.612
Well...

00:08:38.951 --> 00:08:40.753
Oh, sorry.

00:08:41.921 --> 00:08:44.790
You wouldn't want to tell me, right?

00:08:45.491 --> 00:08:49.128
It's not like that.
You've done so much for me.

00:08:50.630 --> 00:08:51.864
Wow!

00:08:52.798 --> 00:08:54.000
I'm so glad.

00:08:58.371 --> 00:09:00.473
You mean you trust me?

00:09:00.873 --> 00:09:02.108
Of course.

00:09:08.114 --> 00:09:09.181
Actually

00:09:10.316 --> 00:09:11.350
he's married.

00:09:16.022 --> 00:09:17.056
What?

00:09:17.857 --> 00:09:19.725
The man who's like a dad to me.

00:09:20.526 --> 00:09:22.228
He has a family.

00:09:24.497 --> 00:09:25.765
So you knew

00:09:27.133 --> 00:09:28.434
that he's married.

00:09:29.869 --> 00:09:31.170
Really?

00:09:32.605 --> 00:09:34.440
I might have told you

00:09:35.341 --> 00:09:37.777
that he always took care of me.

00:09:40.279 --> 00:09:41.480
When I was little

00:09:42.615 --> 00:09:44.951
he played with me all day.

00:09:46.352 --> 00:09:47.553
My mom had to work

00:09:49.322 --> 00:09:51.724
all the time to raise me.

00:09:54.327 --> 00:09:56.629
I was happy that she found love.

00:09:58.097 --> 00:09:59.165
So...

00:10:01.434 --> 00:10:02.969
even if he's married

00:10:04.036 --> 00:10:06.439
as long as he made us happy

00:10:08.808 --> 00:10:10.309
I thought that's fine.

00:10:12.511 --> 00:10:13.746
But he's married.

00:10:15.181 --> 00:10:16.482
Is it really that bad?

00:10:17.483 --> 00:10:18.818
That wrong?

00:10:21.721 --> 00:10:23.155
Isn't it because of

00:10:23.823 --> 00:10:26.125
problems in his own marriage?

00:10:29.128 --> 00:10:30.429
No matter the form

00:10:31.931 --> 00:10:34.100
he's making us happy.

00:10:36.102 --> 00:10:37.770
Maybe it's excusable.

00:10:40.373 --> 00:10:41.674
I don't like people

00:10:44.343 --> 00:10:46.912
who justify infidelity.

00:10:51.584 --> 00:10:53.919
Are you saying
cheating can be forgiven?

00:10:56.389 --> 00:10:57.556
Well...

00:10:58.090 --> 00:11:00.760
Your mother may be happy.

00:11:01.961 --> 00:11:04.330
But she's destroying
the other family.

00:11:04.397 --> 00:11:05.898
That's what. Understand?

00:11:07.066 --> 00:11:11.570
Marriage is about pledging your love
to the one person.

00:11:11.637 --> 00:11:13.806
You choose only one. Understand?

00:11:19.412 --> 00:11:20.579
I'm sorry.

00:11:23.082 --> 00:11:24.717
We should go.

00:11:25.785 --> 00:11:26.886
Wait!

00:11:28.721 --> 00:11:29.855
Wait!

00:11:36.195 --> 00:11:37.196
Well...

00:11:39.865 --> 00:11:41.300
Is something wrong?

00:11:45.337 --> 00:11:46.972
I was a bit surprised.

00:11:51.811 --> 00:11:54.013
I grew up just like you.

00:11:55.548 --> 00:11:56.849
Like me?

00:11:58.317 --> 00:11:59.518
I had only my mom

00:12:00.986 --> 00:12:02.722
and no siblings.

00:12:04.223 --> 00:12:06.459
I never knew my father.

00:12:10.796 --> 00:12:12.264
Minori.

00:12:13.733 --> 00:12:14.800
Let's go!

00:12:17.103 --> 00:12:19.939
You love your friends at daycare!

00:12:20.005 --> 00:12:22.007
- Yes!
- Okay, let's go!

00:12:22.074 --> 00:12:23.709
Grab your backpack.

00:12:23.776 --> 00:12:25.444
We were poor.

00:12:25.511 --> 00:12:26.879
Put your shoes on.

00:12:26.946 --> 00:12:30.149
Happy birthday to you

00:12:30.216 --> 00:12:33.219
Happy birthday to you

00:12:33.285 --> 00:12:40.025
Happy birthday to my precious,
dearest Minori!

00:12:40.092 --> 00:12:44.830
I knew my mother loved me
and I loved her.

00:12:46.899 --> 00:12:48.033
But...

00:12:48.667 --> 00:12:50.503
What do you want for a present?

00:12:51.370 --> 00:12:52.705
I want a dad!

00:12:54.607 --> 00:12:58.210
She never told me
why I didn't have a father.

00:13:03.682 --> 00:13:05.684
A traffic accident.

00:13:05.751 --> 00:13:08.654
She had a child with a married man.

00:13:09.789 --> 00:13:13.592
- She got what she deserved.
- She sure did.

00:13:22.735 --> 00:13:23.803
Minori.

00:13:25.237 --> 00:13:27.873
You come live with Grandpa.

00:13:29.441 --> 00:13:31.377
Dad too?

00:13:35.581 --> 00:13:37.082
Grandpa?

00:13:38.350 --> 00:13:41.086
Where is my dad?

00:13:42.154 --> 00:13:44.123
Does he have another family?

00:13:46.892 --> 00:13:48.027
My mother

00:13:50.996 --> 00:13:53.632
loved someone she shouldn't have.

00:14:08.447 --> 00:14:11.016
When I learned
why I didn't have a father

00:14:12.418 --> 00:14:13.485
I kept thinking

00:14:15.554 --> 00:14:19.191
I shouldn't have been born.

00:14:25.698 --> 00:14:26.765
I've lived my life

00:14:29.668 --> 00:14:33.305
feeling guilty for being the child
born from infidelity.

00:14:37.843 --> 00:14:38.878
That's why

00:14:41.013 --> 00:14:42.748
I've never considered

00:14:43.749 --> 00:14:45.384
infidelity to be excusable.

00:14:49.588 --> 00:14:50.723
Sorry.

00:14:51.423 --> 00:14:53.259
I was inconsiderate.

00:14:58.330 --> 00:14:59.465
Infidelity

00:15:01.700 --> 00:15:03.636
doesn't make anybody happy.

00:15:06.505 --> 00:15:07.573
I didn't want

00:15:09.275 --> 00:15:12.344
to be like my mother who died alone.

00:15:12.845 --> 00:15:13.946
So...

00:15:15.915 --> 00:15:18.017
ever since I was a child...

00:15:22.354 --> 00:15:23.789
I've always dreamed of

00:15:25.391 --> 00:15:27.059
getting married.

00:15:29.628 --> 00:15:31.931
The happiness I finally found.

00:16:00.693 --> 00:16:01.927
Hello?

00:16:02.828 --> 00:16:04.029
Yudai?

00:16:06.131 --> 00:16:07.166
What?

00:16:09.501 --> 00:16:10.569
At the park?

00:16:13.038 --> 00:16:14.106
Okay.

00:16:14.807 --> 00:16:15.874
Thank you.

00:16:17.876 --> 00:16:20.145
Have lots of fun with Tsubasa.

00:16:22.614 --> 00:16:23.615
Bye.

00:16:27.619 --> 00:16:28.620
Well...

00:16:29.922 --> 00:16:31.457
You said Yudai.

00:16:33.659 --> 00:16:34.860
My husband.

00:16:38.464 --> 00:16:40.699
The man who's like your father.

00:16:43.869 --> 00:16:44.903
It can't be.

00:16:46.805 --> 00:16:47.806
Is this

00:16:49.708 --> 00:16:50.709
a coincidence?

00:16:58.917 --> 00:16:59.918
Or...

00:17:03.622 --> 00:17:05.024
You knew everything?

00:17:08.761 --> 00:17:11.363
Say something! Ms. Kume!

00:17:13.132 --> 00:17:14.400
My student...

00:17:17.603 --> 00:17:20.539
happens to be the son

00:17:21.240 --> 00:17:22.775
of my husband's mistress?

00:17:24.676 --> 00:17:26.011
Do you really think

00:17:27.846 --> 00:17:29.481
that's possible?

00:17:35.487 --> 00:17:36.688
You and your mother

00:17:37.723 --> 00:17:40.859
destroyed my family and I hate you!

00:17:41.794 --> 00:17:44.063
I hate you so much!

00:17:52.137 --> 00:17:53.439
Now you understand

00:17:55.674 --> 00:17:57.810
why I approached you.

00:18:00.345 --> 00:18:01.480
Ms. Kume.

00:18:04.616 --> 00:18:05.717
It was

00:18:07.119 --> 00:18:08.520
all a lie?

00:18:12.157 --> 00:18:14.259
I'll never see you again.

00:18:40.686 --> 00:18:45.124
WHERE ARE YOU?

00:18:48.994 --> 00:18:51.597
Yudai said she didn't know.

00:18:53.899 --> 00:18:55.067
That man

00:18:56.502 --> 00:18:58.470
who supports you...

00:19:00.706 --> 00:19:02.307
Isn't he marrying you?

00:19:03.275 --> 00:19:05.744
Her eyes told me she knew everything.

00:19:07.946 --> 00:19:10.249
What if something happens to Wataru?

00:19:19.558 --> 00:19:21.894
I felt stupid

00:19:23.262 --> 00:19:25.130
for spilling out everything.

00:19:27.933 --> 00:19:30.169
But now I knew the source
of my anger.

00:19:36.275 --> 00:19:37.543
That family

00:19:40.045 --> 00:19:42.047
had no sense of guilt.

00:19:47.052 --> 00:19:49.788
- I'll never forgive her.
- I'll never forgive her.

00:19:53.458 --> 00:19:54.760
Woohoo!

00:19:56.995 --> 00:19:58.297
- Dad.
- Yes?

00:19:58.363 --> 00:20:01.200
- Stop.
- Why? Are you done?

00:20:01.934 --> 00:20:03.602
There.

00:20:04.102 --> 00:20:08.674
Because she keeps watching us.

00:20:14.880 --> 00:20:16.782
Do you know her?

00:20:18.684 --> 00:20:20.018
Why is she here?

00:20:21.153 --> 00:20:23.855
She's not with them.

00:20:27.259 --> 00:20:28.527
Gosh.

00:20:29.194 --> 00:20:31.330
You are being a dad.

00:20:32.431 --> 00:20:33.865
What do you want?

00:20:37.236 --> 00:20:41.707
Your mom is not here
but you're being such a good boy!

00:20:43.842 --> 00:20:45.744
Where's your mom?

00:20:45.811 --> 00:20:47.546
Well...

00:20:47.613 --> 00:20:50.983
Mom is playing with her friend.

00:20:51.049 --> 00:20:54.553
Is she now? With her friend?

00:20:56.421 --> 00:20:57.689
Who's her friend?

00:20:58.123 --> 00:21:02.394
I don't know. Probably Sara.

00:21:03.996 --> 00:21:05.264
Really?

00:21:12.004 --> 00:21:14.539
Better see your wife
for who she really is.

00:21:37.329 --> 00:21:38.363
WHERE ARE YOU?

00:21:38.430 --> 00:21:39.698
WHAT TIME ARE YOU COMING HOME?

00:21:39.765 --> 00:21:41.133
CALL ME WHEN YOU GET THIS.

00:21:43.935 --> 00:21:45.804
It must be her.

00:21:46.972 --> 00:21:51.543
You can struggle all you want,
but we know who the winner is.

00:21:54.046 --> 00:21:55.113
I want you

00:21:56.782 --> 00:21:57.949
to have this baby.

00:22:00.852 --> 00:22:01.887
Are you sure?

00:22:02.688 --> 00:22:03.689
Yes.

00:22:04.756 --> 00:22:06.391
I promise I'll marry you.

00:22:09.261 --> 00:22:10.262
Okay.

00:22:14.966 --> 00:22:17.235
Yudai chose me.

00:22:18.036 --> 00:22:19.104
And yet

00:22:20.172 --> 00:22:22.174
why am I so worried?

00:22:38.090 --> 00:22:40.459
Wataru, is everything okay?

00:22:40.525 --> 00:22:43.495
- Like what?
- You never got back to me.

00:22:43.562 --> 00:22:46.498
- I'm not a kid.
- Hey, what about dinner?

00:23:06.785 --> 00:23:08.153
ANKO PANIC

00:23:08.453 --> 00:23:13.325
YOU HAVE NO FRIENDS.

00:23:24.069 --> 00:23:30.375
SUMMER PRACTICE EXAM TOP SCORERS

00:23:30.442 --> 00:23:33.278
NO. 6: WATARU MIYAKE

00:23:48.059 --> 00:23:49.094
Wataru.

00:23:50.395 --> 00:23:52.798
Ms. Kume quit.

00:23:53.598 --> 00:23:54.699
Did you know?

00:23:57.836 --> 00:24:01.807
She quit so soon!
Totally irresponsible.

00:24:03.141 --> 00:24:06.645
She wasn't wearing a ring
but she's married.

00:24:06.711 --> 00:24:07.746
It's bad, right?

00:24:09.514 --> 00:24:11.283
- I knew she was.
- You did?

00:24:13.151 --> 00:24:15.320
So it's good that she quit, right?

00:24:16.555 --> 00:24:19.591
Tutors who mess with students'
emotions are a pain.

00:24:21.593 --> 00:24:23.395
She wasn't a pain.

00:24:24.463 --> 00:24:26.231
She helped me raise my grades.

00:24:26.298 --> 00:24:29.067
That's because you worked hard.

00:24:29.901 --> 00:24:33.171
This workbook will boost your scores.

00:24:33.238 --> 00:24:34.439
I'll lend it to you.

00:24:43.582 --> 00:24:46.585
She is evil, that witch.

00:24:47.819 --> 00:24:49.454
I won't be beaten.

00:24:53.825 --> 00:24:55.093
What?

00:24:55.160 --> 00:24:58.129
You told him everything?
Are you insane?

00:24:59.130 --> 00:25:02.067
Because he has not a shred of guilt.

00:25:02.801 --> 00:25:04.736
So I totally lost it.

00:25:05.437 --> 00:25:09.741
Oh, come on. Then what happened?

00:25:09.808 --> 00:25:13.411
The boy told Yudai
that you know everything, right?

00:25:15.080 --> 00:25:18.250
- Probably.
- What do you mean, "Probably"?

00:25:28.426 --> 00:25:29.427
Look.

00:25:30.629 --> 00:25:32.130
Yudai just sent it.

00:25:33.231 --> 00:25:36.001
WE NEED TO TALK TONIGHT.

00:25:39.404 --> 00:25:40.572
It's over.

00:25:41.873 --> 00:25:43.575
You think so?

00:25:45.277 --> 00:25:47.045
From my experience at work

00:25:47.112 --> 00:25:49.881
when the wife finds out
about the affair

00:25:49.948 --> 00:25:51.883
the husband feels liberated.

00:25:54.452 --> 00:25:59.424
It's like he's relieved that
the lying is finally over.

00:25:59.491 --> 00:26:03.495
Then he shrugs it off
and goes straight to divorce.

00:26:05.096 --> 00:26:06.231
What the...

00:26:07.732 --> 00:26:11.570
Maybe they've been working out
on the divorce for the past few days.

00:26:17.375 --> 00:26:18.376
Hey.

00:26:19.077 --> 00:26:24.215
My guess is he'll suddenly
be all apologies tonight.

00:26:26.117 --> 00:26:27.185
Why?

00:26:27.552 --> 00:26:31.323
He'd want to keep the damages
as low as possible.

00:26:31.389 --> 00:26:35.393
Above all, he'd want to settle it
quickly, without any drama.

00:26:35.460 --> 00:26:39.864
He plays the humble card
so he can win his wife over.

00:26:41.399 --> 00:26:43.435
Treating you like a doormat.

00:26:50.475 --> 00:26:51.977
Thanks for coming.

00:26:53.311 --> 00:26:55.914
I wanted to apologize
for the other day.

00:26:56.848 --> 00:26:58.283
I don't know.

00:26:59.017 --> 00:27:01.953
I guess I wasn't feeling well.
I wasn't myself.

00:27:02.954 --> 00:27:04.322
I'm really sorry.

00:27:07.025 --> 00:27:08.126
I see.

00:27:09.494 --> 00:27:11.696
You're in such a delicate stage.

00:27:12.364 --> 00:27:13.765
Take it easy.

00:27:15.934 --> 00:27:16.968
Okay.

00:27:21.906 --> 00:27:23.208
It's just...

00:27:26.044 --> 00:27:27.779
Are we really good?

00:27:28.947 --> 00:27:29.981
What?

00:27:31.116 --> 00:27:33.251
We can get married, right?

00:27:36.655 --> 00:27:38.156
Don't worry.

00:27:38.857 --> 00:27:41.159
I'm going to talk with Minori.

00:27:41.893 --> 00:27:45.797
But we need to be careful
or it could all be ruined.

00:27:47.165 --> 00:27:49.100
It'll take time.

00:27:49.601 --> 00:27:51.002
You understand that.

00:27:54.039 --> 00:27:55.106
Yes.

00:27:57.742 --> 00:27:59.377
I'll go back to work.

00:28:20.098 --> 00:28:22.734
Mr. Kisaragi, listen to this.

00:28:23.301 --> 00:28:26.071
Accounting said they can't process
this receipt.

00:28:26.137 --> 00:28:28.640
They are being strict lately.

00:28:31.109 --> 00:28:33.778
I can't believe
I have to pay out of pocket.

00:28:33.845 --> 00:28:36.247
Eat bean sprouts. They are cheap.

00:28:36.314 --> 00:28:37.882
Give me a break.

00:28:38.283 --> 00:28:40.251
TSUKISHIRO SHARES SURGE

00:28:40.418 --> 00:28:42.954
That said...

00:28:43.021 --> 00:28:44.956
Guess I've got no choice.

00:28:45.023 --> 00:28:47.325
Wait, you're treating me to dinner?

00:28:47.392 --> 00:28:49.961
I have to go home tonight.

00:28:50.028 --> 00:28:51.963
What? I'm starving!

00:28:55.300 --> 00:28:58.036
Make this stretch until payday.

00:28:58.803 --> 00:29:00.939
You're like a godsend! An angel!

00:29:01.673 --> 00:29:03.708
Heading straight home
from the client.

00:29:03.975 --> 00:29:05.577
- See you.
- Yes, sir.

00:29:06.778 --> 00:29:10.815
You can tell a man's character
by how he spends his money.

00:29:12.584 --> 00:29:14.786
- Hey, Ms. Matsuzaki.
- Yes?

00:29:16.020 --> 00:29:18.823
I'll treat you to dinner.
After the payday.

00:29:19.724 --> 00:29:21.159
Anything you want.

00:29:22.460 --> 00:29:24.195
Thanks. I'd be delighted.

00:29:26.097 --> 00:29:28.099
What? You sound cold.

00:29:31.903 --> 00:29:34.606
WE NEED TO TALK TONIGHT.

00:29:36.775 --> 00:29:38.710
Mom, cream stew for dinner?

00:29:39.711 --> 00:29:42.714
That's right.
I'll cut the carrots into stars.

00:29:42.781 --> 00:29:44.315
Yes!

00:29:46.184 --> 00:29:47.185
Who's that?

00:29:48.086 --> 00:29:50.755
Sorry to barge in. You must be busy.

00:29:50.822 --> 00:29:52.624
- I just came to give you this.
- Come in, Grandma.

00:29:53.258 --> 00:29:56.261
This is the least I can do.

00:29:56.327 --> 00:29:57.896
I appreciate it.

00:29:57.962 --> 00:30:00.865
- You're always so generous.
- What did you bring?

00:30:01.933 --> 00:30:04.602
Would you like to stay for dinner?

00:30:04.669 --> 00:30:06.871
- Right, Tsubasa?
- No, no.

00:30:06.938 --> 00:30:09.808
Don't worry. I'll just give you this
and leave.

00:30:09.874 --> 00:30:11.442
I'll help!

00:30:11.509 --> 00:30:14.012
What a good boy! But look.

00:30:14.078 --> 00:30:16.281
Maybe put the toys away first?

00:30:16.347 --> 00:30:19.584
- I'll do it!
- Good job!

00:30:23.388 --> 00:30:25.056
To tell the truth

00:30:25.790 --> 00:30:28.092
I came because I'm worried about you.

00:30:29.794 --> 00:30:34.165
You said you liked the job
but you quit so soon.

00:30:34.833 --> 00:30:39.404
Did Yudai say something
unkind to you?

00:30:46.578 --> 00:30:50.515
I knew it! Something did happen!

00:30:53.351 --> 00:30:54.552
Minori, dear.

00:30:56.287 --> 00:30:57.488
I'm on your side

00:30:58.590 --> 00:31:00.091
no matter what.

00:31:02.427 --> 00:31:04.028
You can tell me everything.

00:31:07.532 --> 00:31:08.633
The thing is

00:31:11.536 --> 00:31:12.804
Yudai has

00:31:15.006 --> 00:31:17.775
another family.

00:31:22.413 --> 00:31:24.349
Do you mean

00:31:25.884 --> 00:31:27.719
he's having an affair?

00:31:31.289 --> 00:31:32.357
No!

00:31:34.993 --> 00:31:38.496
I'm home. Oh, hi, Mom.

00:31:44.168 --> 00:31:45.436
What's wrong?

00:31:47.272 --> 00:31:49.741
"What's wrong"?

00:31:50.608 --> 00:31:52.343
What's going on?

00:31:54.279 --> 00:31:55.847
An affair?

00:31:57.949 --> 00:32:00.518
I thought you were better!
Shame on you!

00:32:01.252 --> 00:32:04.122
I'm ashamed to call you my son!

00:32:04.188 --> 00:32:06.291
Apologize to Minori! Now!

00:32:09.560 --> 00:32:10.695
I'm sorry!

00:32:21.739 --> 00:32:22.740
Minori?

00:32:28.112 --> 00:32:29.280
No.

00:32:30.248 --> 00:32:31.783
On second thought

00:32:31.849 --> 00:32:36.387
perhaps work can wait till Tsubasa
starts elementary school.

00:32:36.454 --> 00:32:39.257
I'm sorry for the trouble
I caused you.

00:32:39.791 --> 00:32:43.861
Oh, no need to worry about that.

00:32:43.928 --> 00:32:46.464
I totally get how you feel.

00:32:46.531 --> 00:32:49.834
Kids grow up so fast.

00:32:50.435 --> 00:32:54.806
Cherish every moment
and shower him with love.

00:32:56.607 --> 00:32:57.675
I will.

00:32:58.376 --> 00:33:02.714
By the way,
how's your grandfather doing?

00:33:02.780 --> 00:33:05.383
His cancer came as a shock.

00:33:06.117 --> 00:33:09.354
We were fortunate
it was detected early.

00:33:10.121 --> 00:33:13.391
His symptoms are stable
with just the medication.

00:33:14.425 --> 00:33:17.295
I really appreciate your concern.

00:33:18.363 --> 00:33:20.465
Of course.

00:33:20.531 --> 00:33:21.766
He's family.

00:33:23.334 --> 00:33:28.172
My heart aches thinking that the only
future for such a kind mother

00:33:30.742 --> 00:33:32.043
is one of sorrow.

00:33:42.387 --> 00:33:45.923
My guess is he'll suddenly
be all apologies tonight.

00:33:49.394 --> 00:33:50.428
Whatever happens

00:33:52.263 --> 00:33:55.400
I promise I will protect you.

00:34:17.288 --> 00:34:18.289
Hi.

00:34:19.957 --> 00:34:21.125
Hi.

00:34:25.029 --> 00:34:26.664
About the email

00:34:27.231 --> 00:34:29.300
that we need to talk.

00:34:31.536 --> 00:34:32.603
Yes.

00:34:40.511 --> 00:34:41.512
I'm sorry!

00:34:46.451 --> 00:34:47.718
For everything.

00:34:48.252 --> 00:34:50.555
I'm really sorry.
It was all my fault.

00:34:51.589 --> 00:34:53.424
You were right, Sara.

00:34:55.593 --> 00:34:56.661
It's over.

00:34:58.463 --> 00:34:59.931
Tsubasa told me.

00:35:04.302 --> 00:35:05.436
Tsubasa?

00:35:06.704 --> 00:35:07.872
Yes.

00:35:08.840 --> 00:35:10.708
That you were always crying.

00:35:12.810 --> 00:35:14.879
He said it's all my fault.

00:35:15.413 --> 00:35:16.647
I was floored.

00:35:17.782 --> 00:35:19.383
Tsubasa said that?

00:35:20.685 --> 00:35:22.954
I made things hard for you

00:35:23.087 --> 00:35:25.590
while you were busy
with work and the kid.

00:35:26.023 --> 00:35:29.494
I made you feel lonely
and I didn't see it. I'm sorry.

00:35:32.864 --> 00:35:35.666
Is that all you wanted to say?

00:35:36.667 --> 00:35:38.136
What do you mean?

00:35:39.971 --> 00:35:42.373
I was pretty worried.

00:35:46.711 --> 00:35:48.112
You should have told me

00:35:48.946 --> 00:35:52.183
if you were having trouble at work.

00:35:54.252 --> 00:35:55.453
Miyake.

00:35:57.121 --> 00:35:59.557
Why didn't you tell Yudai

00:36:00.291 --> 00:36:01.592
that I knew?

00:36:06.564 --> 00:36:09.333
Do you think

00:36:09.867 --> 00:36:13.104
Miyake just didn't have
a chance to tell him?

00:36:14.472 --> 00:36:20.378
But if he wanted to, he could have
texted him, or called him.

00:36:21.279 --> 00:36:22.480
You're right.

00:36:24.682 --> 00:36:25.850
Hey

00:36:26.784 --> 00:36:29.687
could it be

00:36:31.556 --> 00:36:34.125
that the boy is on your side?

00:36:37.528 --> 00:36:40.031
My side?

00:36:41.966 --> 00:36:46.170
Because he totally fell
for your charm.

00:36:46.971 --> 00:36:48.706
This won't sound good

00:36:49.340 --> 00:36:51.909
but he could still be useful.

00:36:53.878 --> 00:36:56.280
Useful...

00:37:22.607 --> 00:37:24.875
Yes, hello.

00:37:26.911 --> 00:37:28.279
Just a moment.

00:37:30.681 --> 00:37:31.682
What?

00:37:32.783 --> 00:37:34.585
He didn't stay for class?

00:37:38.522 --> 00:37:40.124
Mom, what's wrong?

00:37:40.658 --> 00:37:43.094
What? Nothing.

00:37:43.160 --> 00:37:44.996
What's for dinner?

00:37:45.062 --> 00:37:48.399
Dinner is your favorite, omelet rice!

00:37:48.466 --> 00:37:49.800
Yes!

00:37:49.867 --> 00:37:51.469
We can draw with ketchup.

00:37:51.535 --> 00:37:54.138
Yes, I'll draw a kitty!

00:38:00.011 --> 00:38:01.145
Minori.

00:38:03.381 --> 00:38:04.515
Why?

00:38:08.386 --> 00:38:09.553
Hey, Dad!

00:38:12.923 --> 00:38:14.025
Wataru?

00:38:16.160 --> 00:38:17.161
Why?

00:38:27.405 --> 00:38:29.140
Tsukishiro Jewelry?

00:38:29.206 --> 00:38:31.976
Isn't our happiness built on

00:38:32.043 --> 00:38:34.945
you treating her right?

00:38:35.012 --> 00:38:38.316
That bracelet.
Do you know where it's from?

00:38:38.382 --> 00:38:39.984
Tsukishiro Jewelry, right?

00:38:40.051 --> 00:38:41.652
From your father.

00:38:41.786 --> 00:38:43.788
