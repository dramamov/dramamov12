[Blood River]

00:01:31.620 --> 00:01:33.980
[Based on the novel of the same name from Zhou Munan's Youth in Jianghu series]

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:35.980
[Available on fanqienovel.com & bkneng.com]

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:39.020
[Episode 8]

00:01:39.430 --> 00:01:40.490
You want to see my sword?

00:01:41.150 --> 00:01:42.160
I want to see

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:43.930
who's the strongest swordsman

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:45.410
of this Su generation.

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:47.160
Why is the Su family's top swordsman

00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:47.930
one of them?

00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:49.650
Did Su Ze crown himself?

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:51.180
You use daggers.

00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:52.740
If you take a sword,

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:54.210
I'll looked forward

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:55.290
to that instant

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:56.290
you draw,

00:01:57.030 --> 00:01:58.570
to your blade's light.

00:01:59.860 --> 00:02:00.770
Let's make a bet.

00:02:01.510 --> 00:02:03.340
How many moves before Su Ze's down?

00:02:04.150 --> 00:02:05.650
Ze is still too young.

00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:08.770
Within five moves, I'd say.

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:16.900
I'll make another bet.

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:18.970
I predict that Su Muyu can defeat him

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:20.340
with just one move.

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:24.650
I heard that you practice the Sword Art of Soul Destruction.

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:26.140
Is killing your foes not enough?

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:29.020
Do you have to destroy their souls as well?

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:31.180
Although there's a sinister aura surrounding your sword,

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:33.020
there's no domineering aura surrounding it.

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:34.810
It's because you don't understand the way of the sword.

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:37.280
Break!

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:53.970
A domineering aura doesn't come from ferocity

00:02:54.830 --> 00:02:55.620
or ruthlessness.

00:02:56.110 --> 00:02:57.370
It comes with contempt.

00:03:13.790 --> 00:03:14.620
The Dormant Dragon Sword?

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:25.950
[Sword Qi Soars]

00:03:25.950 --> 00:03:26.580
Master Su.

00:03:30.670 --> 00:03:32.210
Long time no see,

00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:34.090
Lord Kui.

00:03:35.080 --> 00:03:36.580
The poison in the Patriarch's body has been neutralized.

00:03:39.320 --> 00:03:40.740
He instructed me to bring the Dormant Dragon Sword here

00:03:41.670 --> 00:03:42.900
and deliver it to you, the head of the Su family.

00:03:54.360 --> 00:03:55.140
What conditions does he have?

00:03:55.990 --> 00:03:56.620
From now on, I,

00:03:57.510 --> 00:03:58.180
Uncle Zhe,

00:03:59.230 --> 00:03:59.930
Changhe,

00:04:00.670 --> 00:04:01.900
the Patriarch, and the rest of us

00:04:03.320 --> 00:04:04.930
will leave Blood River.

00:04:06.990 --> 00:04:08.300
What has that got to do with me?

00:04:10.080 --> 00:04:10.860
You traitor.

00:04:11.390 --> 00:04:12.250
That's not it.

00:04:14.080 --> 00:04:15.170
I'm serious.

00:04:15.830 --> 00:04:16.420
Su Muyu.

00:04:16.910 --> 00:04:17.890
Don't try to slander me.

00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:19.370
Enough.

00:04:21.200 --> 00:04:22.320
Just now, you said

00:04:22.710 --> 00:04:24.060
"the rest of us",

00:04:24.710 --> 00:04:26.490
who exactly is included?

00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:28.250
I will come up with a name list.

00:04:28.880 --> 00:04:30.250
Everyone in the name list

00:04:30.910 --> 00:04:32.250
will leave Blood River.

00:04:38.590 --> 00:04:41.250
Are you trying to disband Blood River?

00:04:41.920 --> 00:04:43.490
Those who wish to remain may remain.

00:04:44.050 --> 00:04:45.320
Those who wish to leave may leave.

00:04:46.200 --> 00:04:47.600
I just hope to give

00:04:47.600 --> 00:04:49.180
every member of Blood River

00:04:49.880 --> 00:04:51.420
a chance to decide their fate.

00:04:58.390 --> 00:04:59.810
Muyu, oh, Muyu.

00:05:00.940 --> 00:05:03.520
You've served the Patriarch for many years.

00:05:03.680 --> 00:05:06.620
You should know how ridiculous

00:05:07.320 --> 00:05:08.930
this idea of yours is.

00:05:09.760 --> 00:05:11.250
Even if I agree to it,

00:05:11.830 --> 00:05:13.010
the Soul Reapers' Hall

00:05:13.710 --> 00:05:14.810
will still

00:05:14.830 --> 00:05:16.890
put a bounty on your heads.

00:05:17.120 --> 00:05:18.490
They will chase you all until the end of the world!

00:05:19.470 --> 00:05:20.690
That's our business.

00:05:21.950 --> 00:05:23.660
Right now, you just need to decide

00:05:24.510 --> 00:05:25.810
whether you wish to wield the sword or not.

00:05:36.120 --> 00:05:36.780
Master Su.

00:05:37.350 --> 00:05:38.010
This isn't the best timing

00:05:38.200 --> 00:05:39.420
to wield the Dormant Dragon Sword.

00:05:39.950 --> 00:05:40.570
You mustn't agree to

00:05:40.880 --> 00:05:42.060
Su Muyu's condition.

00:05:50.120 --> 00:05:51.250
The Patriarch

00:05:52.720 --> 00:05:55.290
is trying to test me here.

00:05:59.730 --> 00:06:03.270
Wielding this sword alone isn't enough.

00:06:05.760 --> 00:06:07.180
I have to wield it

00:06:07.510 --> 00:06:09.690
and leave Jiuxiao City in one piece.

00:06:12.760 --> 00:06:13.540
When do you think

00:06:13.910 --> 00:06:15.060
is the best time

00:06:15.590 --> 00:06:16.570
and place

00:06:17.030 --> 00:06:18.010
for me to wield it, then?

00:06:19.210 --> 00:06:22.780
Opportunities are always fleeting.

00:06:22.880 --> 00:06:23.670
Therefore,

00:06:23.800 --> 00:06:25.120
the best timing

00:06:25.440 --> 00:06:27.470
is the one you seize!

00:06:32.880 --> 00:06:33.860
I shall take

00:06:38.950 --> 00:06:40.130
the Dormant Dragon Sword.

00:06:40.350 --> 00:06:41.180
Wait!

00:06:51.470 --> 00:06:52.490
Don't you think

00:06:52.680 --> 00:06:53.540
that it's too early for your family

00:06:54.270 --> 00:06:55.570
to wield the Dormant Dragon Sword?

00:07:07.830 --> 00:07:08.570
Who's that?

00:07:09.200 --> 00:07:10.740
Mu Ciling, The Death Coffin.

00:07:10.810 --> 00:07:12.060
That's Mu Ciling of the Mu family.

00:07:12.880 --> 00:07:13.880
He shared the same master as Mu Zizhe,

00:07:13.880 --> 00:07:15.580
who was the former family head of the Mu family.

00:07:16.440 --> 00:07:17.810
Back then, he stole the Hell Palm's manual

00:07:17.880 --> 00:07:19.100
from the Patriarch.

00:07:19.120 --> 00:07:20.130
He cultivated it in secret.

00:07:20.640 --> 00:07:21.890
In the end, he became

00:07:21.950 --> 00:07:23.660
a half-man, half-monster freak.

00:07:24.640 --> 00:07:25.250
After that,

00:07:25.510 --> 00:07:26.690
his deeds were exposed

00:07:26.830 --> 00:07:27.660
due to Mu Zizhe.

00:07:28.320 --> 00:07:29.130
In the end, he was confined

00:07:29.200 --> 00:07:30.250
within the coffin.

00:07:52.030 --> 00:07:53.200
Darn it.

00:07:53.200 --> 00:07:55.580
[Mu Ciling, Mu family]

00:07:56.270 --> 00:07:58.420
Where's that darned Mu Zizhe?

00:08:00.320 --> 00:08:01.980
Show yourself!

00:08:07.830 --> 00:08:08.330
Who's there?

00:08:09.080 --> 00:08:11.060
How dare you run wild on the Su family's grounds?

00:08:13.150 --> 00:08:14.690
That buzz cut is something else.

00:08:16.200 --> 00:08:17.660
You looked like a hairy egg.

00:08:18.760 --> 00:08:19.370
You!

00:08:31.390 --> 00:08:32.660
Mu Zizhe must've lost his mind.

00:08:32.950 --> 00:08:34.450
He actually released a fellow like that from his confinement.

00:08:34.780 --> 00:08:36.240
Rumor has it that he didn't master

00:08:36.240 --> 00:08:37.210
the Hell Palm.

00:08:37.710 --> 00:08:39.180
It seems Mu Zizhe lied to us.

00:08:39.520 --> 00:08:40.730
A red aura is emanating from his palm.

00:08:41.230 --> 00:08:42.180
That means the level of his Hell Palm

00:08:42.320 --> 00:08:43.380
has advanced to at least the eighth tier.

00:08:43.990 --> 00:08:45.260
It seems he's more powerful

00:08:45.950 --> 00:08:47.660
than the heads of the Three Families.

00:08:58.320 --> 00:08:58.970
Don't be silly.

00:08:58.990 --> 00:08:59.930
You aren't his target.

00:08:59.950 --> 00:09:00.660
Why are you trying to stick your head out?

00:09:03.160 --> 00:09:03.930
How did you injure your hand?

00:09:05.680 --> 00:09:06.180
I'm fine.

00:09:06.660 --> 00:09:08.010
I just fought

00:09:08.010 --> 00:09:08.840
that darned Mu Zizhe.

00:09:08.950 --> 00:09:09.810
We were on equal terms.

00:09:12.010 --> 00:09:12.730
Hairy Egg.

00:09:13.440 --> 00:09:14.570
Do you have a death wish?

00:09:15.800 --> 00:09:16.540
Master Mu said

00:09:17.160 --> 00:09:18.850
if you could defeat the head of the Su family

00:09:19.200 --> 00:09:20.140
and stole the Dormant Dragon Sword,

00:09:20.680 --> 00:09:21.730
he would grant you freedom.

00:09:22.950 --> 00:09:24.930
Who does Mu Zizhe think he is?

00:09:25.920 --> 00:09:27.690
How dare he order me around?

00:09:31.560 --> 00:09:32.210
Mu Ciling.

00:09:32.680 --> 00:09:33.060
You...

00:09:33.350 --> 00:09:34.380
Aren't you afraid of the Heart-Piercing Poison?

00:09:34.630 --> 00:09:36.060
You're doing this again, huh?

00:09:36.590 --> 00:09:37.970
You would give me the antidote if I defeat him, huh?

00:09:38.280 --> 00:09:39.090
Are you guys sure about that?

00:09:39.310 --> 00:09:40.440
Master Mu made the promise himself.

00:09:41.800 --> 00:09:42.540
Fine, then.

00:09:44.110 --> 00:09:45.070
Although Mu Zizhe

00:09:45.070 --> 00:09:46.330
isn't someone decent,

00:09:46.780 --> 00:09:48.380
I guess I'll trust him this time.

00:09:49.990 --> 00:09:50.850
Who do I have to defeat again?

00:09:51.440 --> 00:09:52.210
The head of the Su family,

00:09:52.830 --> 00:09:53.780
Su Jinhui.

00:09:58.440 --> 00:09:59.380
Lower your volume.

00:10:16.870 --> 00:10:17.720
What's the name

00:10:17.720 --> 00:10:18.730
of that brat again?

00:10:19.040 --> 00:10:19.690
Mu Tianlin.

00:10:21.910 --> 00:10:23.600
It sounds like the name

00:10:23.600 --> 00:10:24.970
of someone who's about to die.

00:10:26.560 --> 00:10:27.300
What's your name, then?

00:10:28.560 --> 00:10:29.140
Su Ze.

00:10:29.470 --> 00:10:30.780
"Ze", as in the grace of nature?

00:10:31.200 --> 00:10:31.850
That's right.

00:10:42.560 --> 00:10:44.810
That also sounds like the name of someone who's about to die.

00:10:46.280 --> 00:10:47.450
However, Su Jinhui

00:10:47.560 --> 00:10:48.540
is different.

00:10:53.200 --> 00:10:54.140
That sounds like the name

00:10:57.560 --> 00:10:59.260
of a person who's difficult to kill.

00:11:01.280 --> 00:11:02.540
In life, one faces Ciling.

00:11:03.110 --> 00:11:04.540
In death, one faces the Hell King.

00:11:05.680 --> 00:11:06.690
Ten years ago,

00:11:07.110 --> 00:11:09.610
I tried to persuade Mu Zizhe to kill you.

00:11:10.470 --> 00:11:11.500
He refused to do so.

00:11:12.950 --> 00:11:15.210
He said you might be of use to him

00:11:15.870 --> 00:11:17.020
in the future.

00:11:18.320 --> 00:11:19.140
I didn't expect

00:11:19.750 --> 00:11:21.020
the so-called "future" he mentioned

00:11:21.270 --> 00:11:23.020
was today.

00:11:24.990 --> 00:11:26.480
But you actually think

00:11:27.110 --> 00:11:29.210
you can kill me by yourself.

00:11:30.160 --> 00:11:31.610
Doesn't that sound hilarious to you?

00:11:32.200 --> 00:11:33.610
Let me just give it a try,

00:11:34.280 --> 00:11:35.540
and we'll find out.

00:11:36.040 --> 00:11:37.540
You're just a traitor of the Mu family.

00:11:38.440 --> 00:11:40.330
You're not worth my effort, the head of the Su family.

00:11:48.950 --> 00:11:49.970
You're quite good at swordsmanship.

00:11:50.710 --> 00:11:52.260
You're much more powerful than that hairy egg.

00:11:52.710 --> 00:11:53.330
However,

00:11:54.280 --> 00:11:55.970
at best, you're merely decent.

00:12:04.230 --> 00:12:05.060
Uncle Qiu.

00:12:22.160 --> 00:12:23.520
Su Jinhui.

00:12:23.950 --> 00:12:25.020
You're finally willing to show yourself

00:12:25.040 --> 00:12:25.970
and engage us in a battle.

00:12:26.680 --> 00:12:28.380
Back then, it took the three of you

00:12:28.870 --> 00:12:30.450
to barely win against me.

00:12:30.920 --> 00:12:32.690
Now, you're the only person left.

00:12:34.080 --> 00:12:35.090
Are you afraid?

00:12:36.400 --> 00:12:37.730
I've practiced swordsmanship for 40 years.

00:12:38.200 --> 00:12:39.540
I've slain all kinds of monsters and saints.

00:12:40.470 --> 00:12:42.540
The word "fear" means nothing to me.

00:12:47.870 --> 00:12:48.450
Not bad at all.

00:12:48.870 --> 00:12:50.020
It's been many years

00:12:50.040 --> 00:12:51.380
since I last witnessed Master Su's techniques.

00:12:54.680 --> 00:12:56.020
Having fun watching this?

00:12:57.710 --> 00:12:58.780
It looks quite interesting.

00:13:00.870 --> 00:13:01.420
Changhe.

00:13:02.440 --> 00:13:03.090
What ending do you hope

00:13:03.180 --> 00:13:04.090
this play will have?

00:13:09.630 --> 00:13:10.450
For you to be the Patriarch

00:13:10.470 --> 00:13:11.730
and for me to be the head of the Su family.

00:13:13.320 --> 00:13:14.260
Didn't we make this promise

00:13:14.280 --> 00:13:14.970
a long time ago?

00:13:15.440 --> 00:13:16.060
All right.

00:13:16.830 --> 00:13:17.900
Let's join hands

00:13:18.520 --> 00:13:19.260
and deal with him together.

00:13:24.590 --> 00:13:25.610
Su Muyu,

00:13:26.040 --> 00:13:26.690
you're something else.

00:13:26.920 --> 00:13:28.330
You've even learned how to trick people now.

00:13:29.280 --> 00:13:30.780
You think I have no idea what's on your mind, huh?

00:13:31.320 --> 00:13:32.450
You want to use me to repel your foes.

00:13:32.470 --> 00:13:33.300
After that, you'll deliver the sword

00:13:34.630 --> 00:13:36.040
to the head of the Su family.

00:13:36.350 --> 00:13:37.450
I'm thoroughly impressed.

00:13:39.080 --> 00:13:40.210
Hell Palm!

00:14:02.870 --> 00:14:04.260
So, there are still other martial arts experts around.

00:14:05.470 --> 00:14:06.090
Go!

00:14:22.770 --> 00:14:23.930
This old fool

00:14:23.930 --> 00:14:24.960
is quite the experienced swordsman.

00:14:25.750 --> 00:14:27.090
No wonder Mu Zizhe

00:14:27.990 --> 00:14:29.450
assigned the task to me.

00:14:30.200 --> 00:14:31.260
Right now, I can integrate my Hell Palm

00:14:32.160 --> 00:14:33.810
into my swordsmanship.

00:14:34.160 --> 00:14:35.780
You may have seen the palm techniques of the Hell King,

00:14:36.270 --> 00:14:38.480
but have you ever seen his blade before?

00:14:55.080 --> 00:14:56.900
Frostblade Aura?

00:14:59.230 --> 00:15:00.330
Interesting.

00:15:06.680 --> 00:15:08.020
This was a story from a long time ago.

00:15:08.800 --> 00:15:10.570
In "Journey to the West",

00:15:11.160 --> 00:15:12.140
Sun Wukong drew a circle

00:15:12.200 --> 00:15:13.140
with his staff.

00:15:13.830 --> 00:15:15.730
No matter how the spirits and demons rage outside the circle,

00:15:15.990 --> 00:15:18.450
within the circle,

00:15:18.470 --> 00:15:19.540
all stays serene.

00:15:20.520 --> 00:15:21.500
But you see, the different thing is,

00:15:22.630 --> 00:15:24.610
Sun Wukong's circle entraps people

00:15:25.010 --> 00:15:26.140
while my circle

00:15:26.400 --> 00:15:28.180
allows people to enter and exit at will.

00:15:28.950 --> 00:15:30.180
Wherever I stand,

00:15:30.990 --> 00:15:33.060
there lies heaven and earth.

00:15:47.200 --> 00:15:48.780
This will be interesting.

00:15:50.280 --> 00:15:51.180
Muyu, do you wish to join their battle?

00:15:52.040 --> 00:15:53.270
If I lend Master Su a hand,

00:15:53.270 --> 00:15:54.060
and if he can only win against

00:15:54.560 --> 00:15:55.730
Mu Ciling with my help,

00:15:56.160 --> 00:15:57.570
even if he's able to pull out the Dormant Dragon Sword,

00:15:58.440 --> 00:16:00.060
he won't be able to subdue the Three Families.

00:16:00.870 --> 00:16:01.500
On the contrary,

00:16:01.950 --> 00:16:03.140
if Master Su wins the battle,

00:16:03.710 --> 00:16:04.690
at least the Mu family

00:16:05.470 --> 00:16:06.810
won't dare to cause trouble again.

00:16:07.950 --> 00:16:08.500
All right.

00:16:09.280 --> 00:16:10.500
Let's place our bets, then.

00:16:11.200 --> 00:16:11.970
Take a guess

00:16:12.150 --> 00:16:12.970
at who will win.

00:16:13.560 --> 00:16:15.060
Master Su intends to use his full strength.

00:16:16.680 --> 00:16:18.660
Even if Mu Ciling has mastered the Hell Palm,

00:16:19.230 --> 00:16:20.380
his foundation won't be deep.

00:16:20.710 --> 00:16:21.690
He'll surely lose

00:16:21.920 --> 00:16:22.690
once enough time has passed.

00:16:22.820 --> 00:16:23.900
You're wrong.

00:16:24.800 --> 00:16:26.090
You wouldn't be this naive

00:16:26.090 --> 00:16:27.380
had you taken a peek at the manual.

00:16:27.870 --> 00:16:29.260
That's a crazy martial art.

00:16:29.800 --> 00:16:31.380
The depth of one's foundation doesn't matter at all.

00:16:33.630 --> 00:16:34.420
Have you sneaked a peek at it before?

00:16:35.090 --> 00:16:35.840
No.

00:16:36.910 --> 00:16:37.900
It's just a guess.

00:16:59.080 --> 00:16:59.540
Master Su,

00:17:00.470 --> 00:17:01.690
the Mu family has released Mu Ciling.

00:17:04.320 --> 00:17:05.570
It seems the death of Mu Bai

00:17:06.040 --> 00:17:08.700
has enraged Mu Zizhe.

00:17:09.430 --> 00:17:10.090
And,

00:17:11.630 --> 00:17:12.370
he has arrived.

00:17:24.040 --> 00:17:25.300
Hell Palm,

00:17:26.430 --> 00:17:27.780
each tier represents a higher floor.

00:17:28.590 --> 00:17:30.260
At the eighth tier, one beholds Heaven and Earth.

00:17:31.800 --> 00:17:33.220
But when you reach the ninth tier,

00:17:34.630 --> 00:17:36.220
you shall turn into Heaven and Earth itself.

00:17:40.480 --> 00:17:41.980
I will ascend into the ninth tier soon.

00:18:07.600 --> 00:18:08.610
I won the bet.

00:18:12.190 --> 00:18:12.910
Su Muyu.

00:18:13.480 --> 00:18:14.650
Stay here. Don't go out.

00:18:14.910 --> 00:18:15.500
Mu Ciling!

00:18:15.830 --> 00:18:16.820
Steal the Dormant Dragon Sword first!

00:18:16.900 --> 00:18:17.890
We can plan it through after that!

00:18:22.390 --> 00:18:23.020
Uncle Qidao?

00:18:23.960 --> 00:18:24.980
Is that a member of the Xie family?

00:18:25.830 --> 00:18:26.410
Back then,

00:18:26.800 --> 00:18:28.260
the Su family, which was the strongest family out of the three,

00:18:28.830 --> 00:18:30.260
has been utterly defeated

00:18:30.430 --> 00:18:31.700
by Mu Ciling alone.

00:18:39.040 --> 00:18:40.460
Since I've obtained the Dormant Dragon Sword,

00:18:41.040 --> 00:18:42.060
can I become

00:18:43.150 --> 00:18:44.330
the next Patriarch?

00:18:45.110 --> 00:18:46.300
It's far too early for that.

00:18:47.350 --> 00:18:48.650
It's yours only if you can

00:18:49.280 --> 00:18:50.300
take it with you.

00:18:56.240 --> 00:18:56.850
I'm hungry.

00:18:56.870 --> 00:18:58.890
I'm in no mood to fight. I'll make a move first.

00:18:59.150 --> 00:19:00.130
He and his petty tricks.

You thief!

Where do you think you're going?

What exactly are you up to?

00:19:07.280 --> 00:19:08.410
Although I, Su Changhe,

00:19:08.910 --> 00:19:10.050
am injured,

00:19:10.590 --> 00:19:12.330
I have to retrieve the Dormant Dragon Sword for my family's sake.

00:19:13.720 --> 00:19:15.650
None of us is a match for him.

00:19:16.430 --> 00:19:18.020
You're seriously wounded.

00:19:18.800 --> 00:19:19.780
Even if you catch up to him,

00:19:20.760 --> 00:19:21.890
it'll be pointless.

Master Su's resolve

00:19:27.240 --> 00:19:28.610
is just like the serpent blade.

00:19:29.000 --> 00:19:30.060
He fell just as

00:19:30.080 --> 00:19:31.570
he was about to

00:19:32.800 --> 00:19:33.500
reach the position of Patriarch.

00:19:34.830 --> 00:19:35.570
Master Su...

Su Muyu.

I don't think

00:19:39.430 --> 00:19:40.460
you have a choice now.

relay my message to the Patriarch.

00:19:56.560 --> 00:19:57.540
I was unable

00:19:59.830 --> 00:20:01.130
to wield the Dormant Dragon Sword.

00:20:03.280 --> 00:20:04.540
I've let him down.

All members of the Su family,

sheathe your swords!

Yes, sir!

00:20:18.080 --> 00:20:19.020
So, the so-called strongest family

of the Three Families

00:20:21.320 --> 00:20:22.460
is giving up already, huh?

00:20:24.040 --> 00:20:25.650
The Mu family gave rise to a harbinger of death.

00:20:26.350 --> 00:20:27.260
As for the Su family,

00:20:27.390 --> 00:20:28.460
it gave rise to the Umbrella Ghost

and the Undertaker.

00:20:30.520 --> 00:20:31.370
It's a shame that the Umbrella Ghost

00:20:31.390 --> 00:20:32.700
already has a new identity.

00:20:33.520 --> 00:20:34.980
And the Undertaker still wonders

whom he's to bury.

What do you plan to do?

Master Su has already given up on the title of Patriarch.

As for what will happen after this,

00:21:00.520 --> 00:21:01.740
we need to discuss it with the Patriarch.

is to retrieve the Dormant Dragon Sword.

The Dormant Dragon Sword

00:22:21.960 --> 00:22:22.610
is no ordinary sword.

Now, it seems the chaotic situation

00:22:47.870 --> 00:22:48.700
Leave the sword behind!

00:22:53.830 --> 00:22:56.370
That's Su Jinhui's Frostblade Aura.

00:23:05.630 --> 00:23:06.260
Wait.

00:23:07.430 --> 00:23:08.370
That isn't a sword aura.

00:23:10.190 --> 00:23:13.060
That's the Wen family's Death in Thirty Feet.

00:23:15.430 --> 00:23:17.810
That's one of the hardest poison arrays to neutralize in the world.

00:23:18.870 --> 00:23:19.500
If an ordinary person

00:23:19.960 --> 00:23:21.570
inhales the air even for a second,

00:23:22.280 --> 00:23:23.570
they will die in an hour.

00:23:24.430 --> 00:23:25.220
This young girl

00:23:26.040 --> 00:23:27.220
is quite capable.

00:23:27.800 --> 00:23:29.740
She knows the martial arts of the Su family,

00:23:30.040 --> 00:23:31.540
and she can use the Wen family's poison.

00:23:32.190 --> 00:23:33.370
You're the only one in the world who's capable of that.

00:23:35.560 --> 00:23:36.940
Let's wait here, then.

00:23:37.870 --> 00:23:39.650
She'll leave the array eventually.

00:23:45.960 --> 00:23:46.650
Miss,

00:23:47.480 --> 00:23:48.940
you can't maintain your Death in Thirty Feet

00:23:49.150 --> 00:23:50.410
forever.

00:23:51.720 --> 00:23:52.810
Give me the sword,

00:23:53.190 --> 00:23:54.330
and I'll spare you.

00:23:55.760 --> 00:23:56.700
You think it won't last

00:23:56.760 --> 00:23:58.010
just because you said so?

00:23:58.590 --> 00:23:59.410
Even after the current cast is over,

00:23:59.830 --> 00:24:00.780
I can cast it again.

00:24:01.150 --> 00:24:02.170
I'll make sure you two

00:24:02.590 --> 00:24:03.370
won't be able

00:24:03.670 --> 00:24:05.330
to reach me today.

00:24:10.720 --> 00:24:11.980
Su Muyu.

00:24:12.430 --> 00:24:14.060
Why aren't you here yet?

00:24:29.800 --> 00:24:31.500
Miss, it seems you lied to us.

00:24:32.480 --> 00:24:33.370
Your poison array

00:24:33.870 --> 00:24:35.300
is starting to fade.

00:24:40.150 --> 00:24:41.060
Darned Su Muyu.

00:24:41.590 --> 00:24:42.500
He's always late to my rescue.

00:24:43.040 --> 00:24:44.170
I can't hang in there any longer.

00:24:45.800 --> 00:24:46.700
I'll give you guys the sword.

00:24:47.010 --> 00:24:47.920
You guys had better

00:24:47.920 --> 00:24:48.700
keep your promises.

00:24:49.720 --> 00:24:50.740
Don't kill me!

00:25:01.560 --> 00:25:02.460
What are you guys doing here?

00:25:03.280 --> 00:25:03.740
Chen the Dragon,

00:25:03.870 --> 00:25:04.540
take the sword with you.

00:25:04.800 --> 00:25:05.370
I'll cover the rear.

00:25:05.720 --> 00:25:06.090
All right.

00:25:27.240 --> 00:25:27.740
Chen the Dragon!

00:25:33.670 --> 00:25:34.330
Sir,

00:25:35.150 --> 00:25:36.090
I've helped you

00:25:36.760 --> 00:25:37.540
to retain

00:25:38.760 --> 00:25:40.130
the Dormant Dragon Sword.

00:25:43.480 --> 00:25:44.130
Chen the Dragon?

00:25:47.000 --> 00:25:48.460
He was struck by Mu Zizhe's Aqua Heartpiercer,

00:25:48.870 --> 00:25:49.570
Miss Bai.

00:25:51.960 --> 00:25:52.890
It has pierced through his heart.

00:25:53.830 --> 00:25:54.810
There's no way to rescue him.

00:26:07.630 --> 00:26:08.260
My dear girl.

00:26:08.960 --> 00:26:09.780
Are you okay?

00:26:21.560 --> 00:26:22.810
Brat with the umbrella,

00:26:23.910 --> 00:26:24.740
one of your buddies

00:26:24.760 --> 00:26:25.850
is already dead.

00:26:27.630 --> 00:26:28.780
You still have one left.

00:26:32.830 --> 00:26:33.940
Let's negotiate a deal.

00:26:35.040 --> 00:26:36.020
Give me the sword.

00:27:00.720 --> 00:27:01.940
Do you desire this sword?

00:27:03.480 --> 00:27:04.570
Give me the sword,

00:27:05.390 --> 00:27:06.980
and you may choose to pursue this sword later.

00:27:07.430 --> 00:27:09.370
But you have to wait for at least two hours.

00:27:10.760 --> 00:27:12.090
By then, the issue will be between you

00:27:12.110 --> 00:27:13.850
and Mu Zizhe.

00:27:18.590 --> 00:27:20.220
It will be none of my concern.

00:27:21.560 --> 00:27:22.170
Sir!

00:27:22.630 --> 00:27:23.570
Pay him no heed!

00:27:33.960 --> 00:27:34.610
Will you choose him?

00:27:35.910 --> 00:27:36.980
Or will you choose the sword?

00:27:44.670 --> 00:27:45.410
You only have one moment

00:27:45.430 --> 00:27:47.780
to consider it.

00:27:50.960 --> 00:27:51.650
Fine.

00:27:52.670 --> 00:27:53.460
I'll give you the sword.

00:28:02.520 --> 00:28:04.330
That was a powerful toss.

00:28:06.630 --> 00:28:08.410
Take this sword to the Mu family.

00:28:09.720 --> 00:28:10.460
Deliver it to him.

00:28:11.630 --> 00:28:12.740
After that, tell him this.

00:28:15.480 --> 00:28:16.700
I, Su Muyu, hereby swear

00:28:18.160 --> 00:28:20.260
that no matter what identity Mu Zizhe assumes,

00:28:21.240 --> 00:28:22.890
no matter where he goes,

00:28:24.190 --> 00:28:25.740
no matter how long it takes for me to reach him,

00:28:27.430 --> 00:28:28.460
I'll surely

00:28:31.110 --> 00:28:32.700
kill him with my own hands.

00:28:45.830 --> 00:28:46.650
Excellent.

00:28:51.190 --> 00:28:52.020
Excellent!

00:28:53.280 --> 00:28:54.020
Excellent!

00:28:56.320 --> 00:28:57.980
I'll surely deliver both the sword and your message.

00:29:10.040 --> 00:29:10.780
Yin the Tiger!

00:29:12.630 --> 00:29:13.220
Sir,

00:29:13.630 --> 00:29:14.650
we failed to protect the sword.

00:29:16.670 --> 00:29:17.540
It's good as long as you're okay.

00:29:17.720 --> 00:29:18.850
Darn it.

00:29:21.800 --> 00:29:22.500
Uncle Qidao.

00:29:24.080 --> 00:29:25.810
I thought you wouldn't get yourself involved.

00:29:26.800 --> 00:29:29.460
You should ask that darned buddy of yours.

00:29:47.040 --> 00:29:48.130
I've already obtained

00:29:49.040 --> 00:29:50.090
the sword you desired.

00:29:51.110 --> 00:29:52.260
Where's my antidote?

00:29:52.720 --> 00:29:54.610
I wasn't the one who took you to Jiuxiao City.

00:29:55.190 --> 00:29:57.090
He has the item you desire.

00:29:58.350 --> 00:29:59.090
You mean Water Official?

00:29:59.520 --> 00:30:01.130
He hasn't left Jiuxiao City yet.

00:30:02.080 --> 00:30:03.540
He won't leave

00:30:03.960 --> 00:30:05.370
before the end of the show.

00:30:08.520 --> 00:30:09.460
If so, Master Mu...

00:30:09.760 --> 00:30:10.410
No.

00:30:11.670 --> 00:30:12.650
I should address you

00:30:14.190 --> 00:30:15.330
as the Patriarch now.

00:30:18.000 --> 00:30:19.130
Patriarch,

00:30:20.560 --> 00:30:21.980
I shall take my leave now.

00:30:22.350 --> 00:30:23.220
But before that,

00:30:23.670 --> 00:30:25.090
someone requested me

00:30:25.350 --> 00:30:26.330
to deliver a message to you.

00:30:28.110 --> 00:30:28.780
Tell me.

00:30:30.190 --> 00:30:31.940
"I, Su Muyu, hereby swear

00:30:34.950 --> 00:30:37.220
that no matter what identity you assume,

00:30:37.870 --> 00:30:39.740
no matter where you go,

00:30:40.590 --> 00:30:41.540
no matter

00:30:43.150 --> 00:30:44.810
how long it takes for me to reach you,

00:30:45.800 --> 00:30:46.890
I'll surely

00:30:48.720 --> 00:30:50.260
kill you with my own hands."

00:30:57.240 --> 00:30:58.130
Su Muyu, huh?

00:30:58.910 --> 00:31:00.260
He's pretty arrogant, isn't he?

00:31:01.190 --> 00:31:01.810
But first,

00:31:02.280 --> 00:31:04.020
he at least has to survive for the day.

00:31:30.960 --> 00:31:31.740
The Mu family

00:31:32.350 --> 00:31:33.850
has already obtained the Dormant Dragon Sword.

00:31:34.800 --> 00:31:36.260
Congratulations, Master Mu.

00:31:36.520 --> 00:31:37.850
Congratulations, Master Mu.

00:31:38.150 --> 00:31:39.610
Congratulations, Patriarch.

00:31:39.830 --> 00:31:41.260
Congratulations, Patriarch.

00:31:41.800 --> 00:31:42.410
Excellent.

00:31:42.960 --> 00:31:43.780
Let's return

00:31:44.350 --> 00:31:45.780
to our sect immediately.

00:31:46.080 --> 00:31:46.610
Yes, sir.

00:31:53.240 --> 00:31:53.850
None of you

00:31:54.430 --> 00:31:56.300
will be able to leave this place alive.

00:31:58.590 --> 00:31:59.410
Xie Qidao,

00:32:00.190 --> 00:32:01.410
you actually came.

00:32:02.830 --> 00:32:03.980
It's as if you guys

00:32:04.190 --> 00:32:05.090
think that I shouldn't be here.

00:32:06.190 --> 00:32:08.020
But I'm here.

00:32:09.800 --> 00:32:11.610
I already have the Dormant Dragon Sword.

00:32:12.120 --> 00:32:14.170
I'm the current Patriarch of Blood River.

00:32:15.480 --> 00:32:16.220
What a joke.

00:32:17.320 --> 00:32:19.810
Even the fledglings of Blood River know

00:32:20.280 --> 00:32:21.890
that it's pointless to possess the Dormant Dragon Sword alone.

00:32:22.590 --> 00:32:24.460
You have to return to the sect in one piece.

00:32:25.080 --> 00:32:27.060
You're not the Patriarch until you receive the acknowledgment

00:32:27.280 --> 00:32:28.810
of the Soul Reapers' Hall's Three Officials.

00:32:29.350 --> 00:32:30.570
It's a shame

00:32:31.150 --> 00:32:32.650
that you won't be able to leave Jiuxiao City alive.

00:32:33.240 --> 00:32:34.020
I don't think

00:32:34.630 --> 00:32:36.130
you'll be able to leave this courtyard alive.

00:32:36.520 --> 00:32:37.650
You think you can stop me by yourself?

00:32:42.280 --> 00:32:42.940
Of course.

00:32:43.630 --> 00:32:44.610
I'm here as well.

00:32:49.520 --> 00:32:50.370
Xie Ba?

00:32:52.080 --> 00:32:53.300
Mu Zizhe,

00:32:54.080 --> 00:32:55.740
we've finally met

00:32:55.760 --> 00:32:56.500
at Jiuxiao City.

00:33:02.800 --> 00:33:03.410
Ba,

00:33:04.080 --> 00:33:04.980
sorry for the trouble.

00:33:05.520 --> 00:33:06.610
You were supposed

00:33:07.320 --> 00:33:08.850
to inherit my title.

00:33:09.670 --> 00:33:11.410
Once I retrieve the Dormant Dragon Sword

00:33:11.870 --> 00:33:13.090
and become the Patriarch,

00:33:13.800 --> 00:33:15.570
you shall be the next head

00:33:15.760 --> 00:33:17.130
of the Xie family.

00:33:28.670 --> 00:33:30.020
It seems I don't need to do anything.

00:33:30.560 --> 00:33:32.090
There's a good show about to happen.

00:33:33.350 --> 00:33:33.980
The Xie family is here

00:33:34.830 --> 00:33:36.330
with our 56 long sabers.

00:33:37.390 --> 00:33:38.940
We're here to retrieve one sword

00:33:39.670 --> 00:33:40.700
from the head of the Mu family.

00:33:41.000 --> 00:33:41.740
Retrieve one sword, huh?

00:33:42.280 --> 00:33:42.850
Do you know

00:33:42.870 --> 00:33:44.220
that Mu Bai died in an attempt

00:33:44.240 --> 00:33:45.300
to retrieve the Dormant Dragon Sword?

00:33:45.390 --> 00:33:46.130
I know that.

00:33:47.080 --> 00:33:47.890
But the Xie family

00:33:48.320 --> 00:33:49.810
didn't kill him.

00:33:50.520 --> 00:33:51.260
Moreover,

00:33:51.630 --> 00:33:53.700
my favorite disciple is also dead.

00:33:54.480 --> 00:33:55.810
You and I have been acquaintances for many years.

00:33:56.040 --> 00:33:57.330
Although we follow different paths,

00:33:58.240 --> 00:33:59.980
we're still friends for many years.

00:34:00.830 --> 00:34:01.780
There's no need for us

00:34:02.320 --> 00:34:04.130
to draw our swords against each other.

00:34:04.960 --> 00:34:05.810
What about this?

00:34:07.280 --> 00:34:08.690
Once I become the Patriarch,

00:34:09.590 --> 00:34:11.170
I'll appoint you as the Deputy Patriarch.

00:34:11.710 --> 00:34:13.210
After that, we can eradicate the Su family

00:34:13.440 --> 00:34:14.060
together.

00:34:14.520 --> 00:34:15.130
What do you think?

00:34:15.560 --> 00:34:16.290
What a joke.

00:34:17.000 --> 00:34:18.460
Do you think the Soul Reapers' Hall is just an empty hall?

00:34:19.040 --> 00:34:20.290
I'll become the Patriarch

00:34:20.920 --> 00:34:22.090
by hook or by crook.

00:34:23.010 --> 00:34:24.320
Darn it!

00:34:24.710 --> 00:34:26.380
What a fool.

00:34:26.920 --> 00:34:29.500
The Xie family and the Su family

00:34:30.190 --> 00:34:31.210
were always the vanguards

00:34:31.520 --> 00:34:33.020
of Blood River.

00:34:33.840 --> 00:34:35.090
The Mu family

00:34:35.440 --> 00:34:37.170
was just a bunch of cowards

00:34:37.310 --> 00:34:38.340
who attacked others from behind.

00:34:39.440 --> 00:34:40.570
What gives you the right

00:34:40.590 --> 00:34:41.980
to assume this position?

00:34:49.480 --> 00:34:50.860
I'll ask you this again.

00:34:51.840 --> 00:34:53.290
Have you decided to fight us?

00:34:53.880 --> 00:34:54.570
You don't say?

00:34:55.230 --> 00:34:55.770
Fine!

00:34:56.080 --> 00:34:56.650
My brothers!

00:34:57.110 --> 00:34:57.610
Yes, sir!

00:34:57.960 --> 00:34:59.020
Kill all members

00:34:59.560 --> 00:35:01.020
of the Mu family!

00:35:01.040 --> 00:35:01.650
Yes, sir!

00:35:05.560 --> 00:35:06.130
Set up the array!

00:35:06.480 --> 00:35:07.250
Array, Lone Void!

00:35:26.440 --> 00:35:28.090
I didn't expect you to show up.

00:35:30.150 --> 00:35:31.170
The Heaven Official grants blessings.

00:35:31.190 --> 00:35:32.380
The Earth Official pardons sins.

00:35:32.750 --> 00:35:34.170
The Water Official resolves misfortunes.

00:35:35.360 --> 00:35:36.980
Now, Blood River is in total chaos.

00:35:37.270 --> 00:35:39.340
Naturally, I have to resolve the current misfortune.

00:35:46.150 --> 00:35:47.500
The true Dormant Dragon Sword

00:35:47.520 --> 00:35:48.290
lies here with you,

00:35:48.840 --> 00:35:50.210
together with the dark secrets of Blood River.

00:35:50.560 --> 00:35:51.460
You've always held them

00:35:51.480 --> 00:35:52.980
tightly in your hands.

00:35:57.590 --> 00:35:59.420
Who assigned you to assassinate

00:36:00.310 --> 00:36:01.380
Second Master Tang?

00:36:02.880 --> 00:36:04.250
Naturally, it's someone you know.

00:36:05.150 --> 00:36:06.690
I assume everything that's been happening

00:36:07.400 --> 00:36:09.060
is also within his expectations, then.

00:36:10.840 --> 00:36:12.060
He's not a prophet.

00:36:12.150 --> 00:36:13.420
He can't foresee everything.

00:36:14.360 --> 00:36:15.650
However, he's also looking forward

00:36:15.880 --> 00:36:16.770
to the fact that the current Blood River

00:36:17.110 --> 00:36:17.730
will turn into

00:36:18.110 --> 00:36:18.900
an entirely new organization

00:36:18.920 --> 00:36:20.340
after this incident.

00:36:22.110 --> 00:36:23.690
But no matter what Blood River will turn into,

00:36:24.110 --> 00:36:25.540
I should never be here.

00:36:27.710 --> 00:36:29.340
You do live up to your reputation as the Patriarch.

00:36:35.960 --> 00:36:37.340
I can head to Homeland.

00:36:38.790 --> 00:36:39.820
Homeland?

00:36:43.310 --> 00:36:44.500
Do you mean the legendary sanctuary

00:36:44.520 --> 00:36:45.770
of Blood River?

00:36:48.400 --> 00:36:50.250
The sanctuary that can allow people

00:36:51.480 --> 00:36:52.940
to put down their feuds and grudges

00:36:54.000 --> 00:36:55.020
and lead a peaceful life?

00:36:59.670 --> 00:37:01.020
I wouldn't have thought of it as hilarious

00:37:01.040 --> 00:37:02.500
if someone else were to utter the same thing.

00:37:03.000 --> 00:37:04.290
But you're the Patriarch.

00:37:05.080 --> 00:37:05.940
You should know

00:37:06.590 --> 00:37:07.340
that

00:37:07.710 --> 00:37:09.460
Homeland never existed.

00:37:09.790 --> 00:37:11.130
That was just a lie.

00:37:13.230 --> 00:37:15.020
I was the Patriarch for 30 years.

00:37:17.190 --> 00:37:19.130
My reign lasted longer than any of those before me.

00:37:19.790 --> 00:37:21.290
Therefore, I've achieved something

00:37:21.750 --> 00:37:23.770
that they couldn't manage to achieve.

00:37:25.440 --> 00:37:27.250
So, you actually built such a place

00:37:29.110 --> 00:37:30.170
secretly

00:37:30.190 --> 00:37:31.210
behind our backs, huh?

00:37:34.480 --> 00:37:36.610
Is that the escape route

00:37:36.920 --> 00:37:37.690
that you've built for yourself?

00:37:40.400 --> 00:37:41.830
Are you going to defy the Three Officials?

00:37:45.920 --> 00:37:46.760
Something's off.

00:37:47.960 --> 00:37:49.080
That palm strike of yours...

00:37:50.310 --> 00:37:51.540
The Snow Falls on a Plum Blossom poison in your body

00:37:51.710 --> 00:37:52.820
is actually neutralized.

00:37:53.920 --> 00:37:55.770
I've been the Patriarch for 30 years.

00:37:56.400 --> 00:37:57.060
The only thing

00:37:57.080 --> 00:37:58.250
that I haven't managed to achieve

00:37:58.840 --> 00:37:59.770
is to admit defeat.

00:38:02.960 --> 00:38:04.460
You guys intend to use my death

00:38:05.190 --> 00:38:07.210
to create a new version of Blood River.

00:38:08.480 --> 00:38:09.650
However, to me,

00:38:10.190 --> 00:38:11.250
Blood River will only be able to

00:38:12.000 --> 00:38:13.690
embrace a new future

00:38:13.880 --> 00:38:15.090
after your deaths.

00:38:17.400 --> 00:38:18.500
Just like what you said,

00:38:19.400 --> 00:38:21.540
the poison in my body has been neutralized.

00:38:22.360 --> 00:38:22.940
You are no match

00:38:23.790 --> 00:38:25.060
for me.

00:38:27.560 --> 00:38:29.060
I think you should understand

00:38:30.000 --> 00:38:31.650
that Blood River never belonged to you.

00:38:32.590 --> 00:38:33.460
The Soul Reapers' Hall

00:38:33.560 --> 00:38:35.060
doesn't own Blood River either.

00:38:35.920 --> 00:38:36.730
It's just

00:38:36.750 --> 00:38:38.250
a tool meant for killing.

00:38:39.310 --> 00:38:40.980
We don't have the right to decide how it's used.

00:38:41.710 --> 00:38:43.540
Only those who command it have the right.

00:38:44.840 --> 00:38:46.020
That's the one thing I wanted to change

00:38:47.230 --> 00:38:49.290
during my 30 years of reign.

00:38:50.360 --> 00:38:51.730
Although I couldn't achieve that,

00:38:52.670 --> 00:38:53.690
I'm sure someone can achieve that

00:38:54.480 --> 00:38:56.460
in the end.

00:38:57.270 --> 00:38:58.130
If so,

00:38:59.560 --> 00:39:00.460
I shall wait for your good news.

00:39:09.310 --> 00:39:09.940
Sir.

00:39:11.440 --> 00:39:12.290
