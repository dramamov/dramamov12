The bees are flying

00:00:19.874 --> 00:00:23.211
Wild roses are blooming

00:00:24.879 --> 00:00:28.550
Around the pond

00:00:34.722 --> 00:00:38.017
The bees are flying

00:01:11.426 --> 00:01:14.262
Buzz! Buzz! Buzz!

00:01:15.263 --> 00:01:17.640
The bees are flying!

00:01:20.018 --> 00:01:23.146
Wild roses are blooming

00:01:25.189 --> 00:01:28.484
Around the pond!

00:01:29.903 --> 00:01:32.196
Buzz! Buzz! Buzz!

00:01:36.743 --> 00:01:38.036
I'm…

00:01:39.370 --> 00:01:41.039
going to jump now!

00:02:42.016 --> 00:02:42.892
Thank you.

INTERVIEW DETAILS - AFTER SCREENING

00:03:27.895 --> 00:03:29.272
WE APPRECIATE YOUR TIME AND CONSIDERATION

00:03:29.355 --> 00:03:30.523
NONAMARE COMPANY

00:03:33.317 --> 00:03:36.612
NONAMARE

00:03:40.158 --> 00:03:43.745
Nonamare is dedicated
to delivering innovative solutions

00:03:44.245 --> 00:03:49.459
that perfectly meet
our customers’ needs in every situation.

00:03:53.087 --> 00:03:55.131
It sounds like a lame company.

00:04:47.517 --> 00:04:49.268
It just looks good on the outside.

00:04:55.400 --> 00:04:59.070
NONAMARE'S INTERVIEW SITE

00:05:22.093 --> 00:05:25.888
I want to grow
as a professional at your company,

00:05:25.972 --> 00:05:29.559
leading to meet customers' needs
in every situation.

00:05:29.642 --> 00:05:32.854
Once I join the company, I plan
to apply my communication strengths

00:05:32.937 --> 00:05:35.273
to enhance my business skills,
embrace new challenges,

00:05:35.356 --> 00:05:37.400
and continue growing as a professional.

00:05:37.483 --> 00:05:39.110
My volunteer experience

00:05:39.193 --> 00:05:41.362
has taught me that I can persevere

00:05:41.445 --> 00:05:44.448
and deliver results
even under difficult circumstances.

00:05:48.578 --> 00:05:49.829
Um…

00:05:50.830 --> 00:05:52.206
First of all,

00:05:52.957 --> 00:05:54.750
a company is not the same as volunteering.

00:05:55.751 --> 00:05:59.380
It’s good to want to improve yourself.

00:06:00.381 --> 00:06:04.886
The intention is commendable.
But a company is not a school.

00:06:05.761 --> 00:06:07.430
Are business skills…

00:06:08.556 --> 00:06:09.432
actually skills?

00:06:12.310 --> 00:06:15.521
I’m from Japan’s "lost generation".

00:06:16.939 --> 00:06:18.524
Back then, job hunting meant

00:06:19.192 --> 00:06:26.073
sending handwritten postcards, requesting
materials from each company, and applying

00:06:26.908 --> 00:06:31.454
to hundreds of them
just to scrape into a small,

00:06:32.622 --> 00:06:37.418
obscure company. I worked hard,
built my network, and eventually managed

00:06:37.919 --> 00:06:39.545
to land a better position,

00:06:39.629 --> 00:06:42.506
only to find that someone my age,

00:06:43.299 --> 00:06:46.594
who had connections, was my boss.

00:06:47.762 --> 00:06:51.057
Even so, I didn’t give up.
I did everything he said,

00:06:51.140 --> 00:06:56.646
endured the harshest work,
closed more deals than anyone,

00:06:56.729 --> 00:07:01.025
and put my own life and family
on hold to keep working.

00:07:01.567 --> 00:07:03.527
That’s how you finally

00:07:04.195 --> 00:07:07.365
get recognized as a proper adult.

00:07:07.448 --> 00:07:09.659
But that's not all!

00:07:10.243 --> 00:07:11.494
From then on,

00:07:11.577 --> 00:07:16.290
you must keep demonstrating
that you are someone the company needs.

00:07:18.626 --> 00:07:19.961
That's what it means

00:07:20.920 --> 00:07:22.630
to be an employee.

00:07:24.257 --> 00:07:26.300
Are you prepared for that?

00:07:27.802 --> 00:07:29.303
Because I am.

00:07:34.058 --> 00:07:35.184
I am!

00:07:41.023 --> 00:07:42.066
Wonderful.

00:07:45.695 --> 00:07:48.072
And how is it that someone

00:07:49.031 --> 00:07:51.784
as prepared as you is unemployed?

00:07:53.327 --> 00:07:57.373
Why are you here at this moment?

00:07:59.375 --> 00:08:00.251
That's…

00:08:10.886 --> 00:08:13.431
We are finished with this group.
Good job, everyone.

00:08:14.223 --> 00:08:15.850
Thank you.

00:08:33.784 --> 00:08:35.578
Did you hear my question?

00:08:42.043 --> 00:08:45.630
Why are you here at this moment?

00:08:49.800 --> 00:08:51.761
It isn’t something
to discuss in an interview.

00:08:57.933 --> 00:09:02.146
I got fired. Arrested for embezzlement.

00:09:03.189 --> 00:09:06.359
Well, when I say embezzlement,
it was really just covering

00:09:06.442 --> 00:09:08.903
entertainment expenses
that couldn’t be claimed on receipts.

00:09:10.655 --> 00:09:14.116
I did buy a few things for myself.

00:09:15.868 --> 00:09:17.244
Like this.

00:09:18.579 --> 00:09:22.124
Everyone did it. It wasn't just me.

00:09:24.335 --> 00:09:26.295
But I was the only one
they made an example of.

00:09:29.590 --> 00:09:33.302
I was asked to repay amounts
going back ten years,

00:09:34.011 --> 00:09:37.223
and I did so to avoid being prosecuted.

00:09:38.974 --> 00:09:42.645
Then my wife asked for a divorce.

00:09:43.646 --> 00:09:47.775
We’d already been
living separately at home,

00:09:49.610 --> 00:09:53.698
but now she’s demanding
a division of property and alimony.

00:09:54.699 --> 00:09:56.617
I’m completely broke.

00:09:58.494 --> 00:10:03.124
No company would hire a 47-year-old
who's committed embezzlement.

00:10:05.793 --> 00:10:08.129
I'm surprised I was called in
for an interview.

00:10:14.093 --> 00:10:16.554
I'm so tired.

00:10:18.556 --> 00:10:20.433
I've had enough.

00:10:22.101 --> 00:10:23.144
Enough…

00:10:24.228 --> 00:10:27.148
You've got no job, no savings,

00:10:28.190 --> 00:10:29.650
and your future is uncertain.

00:10:33.112 --> 00:10:34.572
You’ve got no option but to die.

00:10:37.700 --> 00:10:39.410
Our company drives innovation.

00:10:40.411 --> 00:10:42.913
A person who drives innovation…

00:10:42.997 --> 00:10:47.418
That is exactly
the kind of person I am looking for.

00:10:54.049 --> 00:10:59.096
I'm Nonamare's CEO. My name's Kizashi.

00:11:01.015 --> 00:11:02.892
Please come again tomorrow.

00:11:04.143 --> 00:11:05.936
We'll have one last interview.

00:11:17.573 --> 00:11:18.949
NONAMARE'S FINAL INTERVIEW SITE

00:11:25.915 --> 00:11:26.957
Excuse me.

00:11:29.793 --> 00:11:31.795
Thank you for coming, Bunta.

00:11:33.297 --> 00:11:37.009
If there are no objections,
I’d like to start the final interview.

00:11:37.092 --> 00:11:37.927
Yes.

00:11:39.303 --> 00:11:40.721
Please take that.

00:11:48.312 --> 00:11:49.438
Take it.

00:11:53.192 --> 00:11:56.237
Is it some kind of supplement?

00:12:00.074 --> 00:12:01.534
-Um…
-I won't repeat myself.

00:12:03.285 --> 00:12:04.161
Please, take it.

00:12:40.823 --> 00:12:42.116
You passed.

00:12:43.367 --> 00:12:46.078
Congratulations. You're hired.

00:12:47.496 --> 00:12:48.372
Thank you.

00:12:49.373 --> 00:12:50.457
Thank you very much.

00:12:51.292 --> 00:12:54.670
-From this moment, you're an Esper.
-Yes!

00:12:56.088 --> 00:12:56.922
Sorry?

00:12:57.965 --> 00:12:59.800
-An Esper?
-Do you not know?

00:12:59.883 --> 00:13:02.845
ESP, psychics, supernatural powers.

00:13:03.345 --> 00:13:06.849
People who use such special abilities
are called Espers.

00:13:06.932 --> 00:13:07.933
But…

00:13:08.851 --> 00:13:11.729
I don't have any special abilities.

00:13:12.229 --> 00:13:14.857
-I'm an average human.
-Did you take that pill?

00:13:14.940 --> 00:13:17.818
-Yes.
-Then you're an Esper now.

00:13:19.570 --> 00:13:22.072
-Very well.
-Well, when I say Esper,

00:13:22.906 --> 00:13:25.367
I mean a little. Just a bit.

00:13:28.078 --> 00:13:31.165
This is what Nonamare Company is about.

00:13:34.168 --> 00:13:36.962
Specifically, what kind of work will I do?

00:13:38.881 --> 00:13:40.007
You're going…

00:13:40.883 --> 00:13:41.967
to save the world.

00:13:44.219 --> 00:13:45.679
Save…

00:13:46.680 --> 00:13:47.973
the world?

00:14:24.426 --> 00:14:26.428
TAKKOBI

00:14:31.058 --> 00:14:34.520
Starting today, you're an Esper,
but you can't tell anyone.

00:14:35.104 --> 00:14:37.022
It's top secret.

00:14:38.774 --> 00:14:40.192
Company housing will be provided.

00:14:41.110 --> 00:14:45.072
You will live there with another employee
and pose as a married couple.

00:14:45.155 --> 00:14:48.367
-A married couple?
-It’s just a facade. A temporary guise.

00:14:48.951 --> 00:14:51.286
Talking about Espers
in the house is forbidden too.

00:14:51.370 --> 00:14:55.124
Talk as if you’re a married couple,
and go along with what she says.

00:14:57.543 --> 00:14:58.752
You're Bunta,

00:14:59.545 --> 00:15:01.255
but she'll probably call you Bunty.

00:15:03.465 --> 00:15:05.175
That’s quite original.

00:15:05.759 --> 00:15:07.344
Her name is…

00:15:08.971 --> 00:15:09.888
Shiki.

00:15:13.392 --> 00:15:14.226
Welcome home.

00:15:23.986 --> 00:15:25.070
I'm home.

00:15:28.115 --> 00:15:30.242
Dinner's ready.

00:15:34.163 --> 00:15:36.081
Are we in the slump phase of our marriage?

00:15:46.300 --> 00:15:47.551
Do you want some more?

00:15:49.344 --> 00:15:50.721
Can I?

00:15:50.804 --> 00:15:53.015
-Yes.
-Thank you.

00:15:58.103 --> 00:15:59.146
Um…

00:16:00.189 --> 00:16:02.191
Have you been here a long time?

00:16:02.858 --> 00:16:05.611
-What do you mean?
-Your length of service.

00:16:08.530 --> 00:16:09.865
About two years.

00:16:11.909 --> 00:16:13.452
I see.

00:16:16.997 --> 00:16:19.458
-Here you go.
-Thank you.

00:16:22.795 --> 00:16:24.171
Why are you so formal?

00:16:25.923 --> 00:16:26.757
Sorry?

00:16:28.550 --> 00:16:32.262
Are we suddenly strangers just because
we've been apart for some time?

00:16:33.555 --> 00:16:34.515
Sorry?

00:16:39.311 --> 00:16:41.313
-Bunty.
-Yes?

00:16:41.396 --> 00:16:45.442
Don’t you have a word for your wife,
who cooked your favorite meal

00:16:45.526 --> 00:16:47.444
and waited impatiently

00:16:47.528 --> 00:16:50.197
while you were away
on that endless business trip?

00:16:53.242 --> 00:16:56.495
Fine.
I don't want to fight after this long.

00:16:59.540 --> 00:17:02.835
Am I supposed to have just
come back from an endless

00:17:02.918 --> 00:17:04.086
business trip?

00:17:05.420 --> 00:17:06.380
Okay, I understand.

00:17:08.090 --> 00:17:09.216
Um…

00:17:10.843 --> 00:17:14.513
I'm sorry I was away for so long.

00:17:15.472 --> 00:17:17.432
I’ll do better from now on.

00:17:24.064 --> 00:17:25.357
I mean, I’ll be counting on you.

00:17:30.571 --> 00:17:32.156
Oh! The dinner!

00:17:33.282 --> 00:17:36.034
It's awesome! Very yummy!

00:17:39.204 --> 00:17:41.874
You're acting weird, Bunty.

00:17:44.376 --> 00:17:45.836
I mean…

00:17:47.713 --> 00:17:53.093
Are you an actress from a theatre company,
or do you do stage acting professionally?

00:17:53.886 --> 00:17:55.762
Really, what are you up to?

00:17:58.473 --> 00:17:59.600
Wow…

00:18:01.894 --> 00:18:03.061
Good night.

00:18:03.896 --> 00:18:05.898
Good night, Shiki.

00:18:09.735 --> 00:18:11.069
Good night, Shiki.

00:18:13.155 --> 00:18:15.574
Can I really talk to her so casually?

00:18:17.367 --> 00:18:20.287
Should I call her honey too?

00:18:44.478 --> 00:18:49.149
Excuse me. Is it okay if I use
the sofa in the living room?

00:18:50.317 --> 00:18:54.112
Please don’t. I just washed the covers.
You can sleep on the bed.

00:18:54.696 --> 00:18:55.822
The bed?

00:19:01.245 --> 00:19:02.329
Okay.

00:19:07.209 --> 00:19:08.043
Good night!

00:19:11.421 --> 00:19:12.923
Excuse me. Sorry about that.

00:19:14.049 --> 00:19:16.051
Stupid me.

00:19:46.039 --> 00:19:48.834
No! No! No!

00:19:49.876 --> 00:19:54.423
You don’t have to go this far
to act like my wife, do you?

00:19:55.507 --> 00:19:58.051
You're taking your job too seriously!

00:19:59.094 --> 00:20:00.637
I work the early shift tomorrow.

00:20:00.721 --> 00:20:03.473
No matter how I look, I’ve always

00:20:03.557 --> 00:20:07.686
taken pride in never having done
anything even close to sexual harassment.

00:20:08.437 --> 00:20:10.439
Please, don’t take that

00:20:10.522 --> 00:20:13.358
away from me!

00:20:14.901 --> 00:20:17.446
If we got into the same bed,

00:20:18.363 --> 00:20:20.115
what would I be seen as?

00:20:22.200 --> 00:20:23.952
What do you mean by that?

00:20:25.912 --> 00:20:28.332
You don't like me anymore?

00:20:29.541 --> 00:20:31.543
Could it be that you want a divorce?

00:20:32.794 --> 00:20:35.964
Do you not want to be with
a high-maintenance woman like me anymore?

00:20:46.808 --> 00:20:47.976
Let's go to sleep.

00:21:33.814 --> 00:21:34.940
Welcome home.

00:21:38.777 --> 00:21:40.112
Good night.

00:22:00.757 --> 00:22:03.093
TAKKOBI

00:22:10.892 --> 00:22:13.478
Bunty, look at this.

00:22:22.696 --> 00:22:26.408
I made pickled plums.
We can use the plum vinegar too.

00:22:27.033 --> 00:22:30.453
I'll dry them and let them rest,
so they'll be ready for winter.

00:22:30.537 --> 00:22:31.830
How exciting.

00:22:38.837 --> 00:22:40.046
Yes?

00:22:40.130 --> 00:22:43.800
-Good morning. This is Hanzo.
-Good morning. What's up?

00:22:43.884 --> 00:22:44.968
I'd like to speak to Bunta.

00:22:45.969 --> 00:22:47.095
Me?

00:22:50.140 --> 00:22:54.394
TAKOYAKI

00:22:57.647 --> 00:22:59.941
-Bunta.
-Yes?

00:23:00.025 --> 00:23:02.319
I'm Hanzo from Nonamare.

00:23:03.904 --> 00:23:06.531
-Nice to meet you.
-This is from the boss.

00:23:07.574 --> 00:23:09.492
It's your login code
for the company’s app.

00:23:09.576 --> 00:23:10.577
Thank you.

00:23:10.660 --> 00:23:11.244
BUNTA

00:23:11.328 --> 00:23:13.371
How's Shiki doing?

00:23:16.041 --> 00:23:19.377
About her… Isn't she a bit weird?

00:23:25.133 --> 00:23:27.260
She's a good person. See ya.

00:23:27.344 --> 00:23:28.470
Let's go.

00:23:31.848 --> 00:23:32.682
Oh?

00:23:34.684 --> 00:23:36.394
What was your Esper again?

00:23:37.729 --> 00:23:38.605
Huh?

00:23:40.023 --> 00:23:41.650
It takes time for some people.

00:23:42.484 --> 00:23:43.652
Don't worry.

00:23:45.779 --> 00:23:47.239
Let's go.

00:23:47.322 --> 00:23:48.657
Good boy.

00:23:54.579 --> 00:23:55.705
I'll get going.

00:23:57.249 --> 00:23:58.250
Have a nice day.

00:24:19.854 --> 00:24:21.273
APP LOGIN CODE

00:24:25.568 --> 00:24:26.486
WELCOME, BUNTA!

00:24:26.569 --> 00:24:27.779
Welcome?

00:24:27.862 --> 00:24:28.697
MISSIONS OF THE DAY

00:24:30.282 --> 00:24:32.701
They’re totally committing to it.

00:24:33.368 --> 00:24:34.536
MISSION 52

00:24:34.619 --> 00:24:38.790
"Make sure Takuma Suzuki
keeps his umbrella with him all day."

00:24:40.542 --> 00:24:42.919
They call this "saving the world"?

00:24:44.212 --> 00:24:45.380
MAKE SURE TAKUMA SUZUKI
KEEPS HIS UMBRELLA WITH HIM ALL DAY

00:24:55.140 --> 00:24:56.808
Right! It's going to rain today.

00:24:58.059 --> 00:25:01.146
They said it was going to rain today!

00:25:01.813 --> 00:25:03.064
They said it’d pour!

00:25:04.149 --> 00:25:05.275
I didn't bring an umbrella!

00:25:05.942 --> 00:25:06.985
Damn it!

00:25:08.445 --> 00:25:11.406
What can I do? Should I go back?

00:25:12.032 --> 00:25:13.158
Damn…

00:25:26.504 --> 00:25:28.423
MISSION 53 - TURN MITSURU SATO’S ALARM
CLOCK FIVE MINUTES AHEAD WHILE HE SLEEPS

00:25:30.717 --> 00:25:33.428
SATO

00:25:33.511 --> 00:25:34.596
Mission 53.

00:25:35.513 --> 00:25:39.934
Turn Mitsuru Sato’s alarm clock
five minutes ahead while he sleeps.

00:25:40.018 --> 00:25:42.103
What kind of company is this?

00:25:46.858 --> 00:25:48.860
I'm not a thief.

00:25:51.196 --> 00:25:52.989
I'm just working.

00:25:58.536 --> 00:26:02.540
SATO

00:26:02.624 --> 00:26:03.875
I'm an Esper.

00:26:09.130 --> 00:26:11.174
Advance it five minutes.

00:26:40.620 --> 00:26:41.704
An Esper? Ridiculous.

00:26:44.040 --> 00:26:45.250
How about you try again?

00:26:46.418 --> 00:26:47.335
This.

00:26:49.963 --> 00:26:50.880
No, I wasn't…

00:26:51.548 --> 00:26:53.967
-Are you one of Sato's friends?
-No…

00:26:54.050 --> 00:26:56.344
Yes! We're best friends.

00:26:57.053 --> 00:27:00.390
The kind who can
just come in while he's asleep.

00:27:01.307 --> 00:27:02.434
Then, let me open the door.

00:27:03.977 --> 00:27:05.145
Are you the landlord?

00:27:06.771 --> 00:27:09.524
MITSURU SATO

00:27:09.607 --> 00:27:11.443
-Go ahead.
-Thank you.

00:27:12.610 --> 00:27:13.570
Excuse me.

00:27:37.886 --> 00:27:39.137
Mission 54.

00:27:39.971 --> 00:27:40.889
Table three.

00:27:40.972 --> 00:27:45.894
Drain Kensaku Takahashi’s
phone battery to zero by 2 p.m.

00:27:47.687 --> 00:27:49.689
How could I do that?

00:27:52.066 --> 00:27:53.526
Let's get going.

00:28:27.101 --> 00:28:28.019
Good.

00:28:28.561 --> 00:28:30.480
Forty-eight percent battery?

00:28:41.241 --> 00:28:43.368
Okay. Turn all these on.

00:28:43.952 --> 00:28:45.620
On, on, on.

00:28:46.204 --> 00:28:47.580
Next, the video games.

00:28:48.498 --> 00:28:49.624
How many games do you have?

00:28:51.042 --> 00:28:53.336
What is this?

00:28:53.419 --> 00:28:56.047
Come on! Come on! Get 'em!

00:28:57.507 --> 00:28:58.758
Okay, this is good.

00:29:12.814 --> 00:29:15.191
Come on!

00:29:21.906 --> 00:29:23.074
Damn!

00:29:30.874 --> 00:29:33.459
You've defeated the enemy.

00:29:40.925 --> 00:29:44.470
Lucky you, taking it easy and all.

00:29:44.554 --> 00:29:46.723
-I was studying.
-Studying?

00:29:46.806 --> 00:29:48.683
-Like homework?
-Yeah.

00:29:48.766 --> 00:29:50.310
I've never done homework in my life!

00:29:50.393 --> 00:29:52.270
-Really?
-I get itchy just thinking about it.

00:29:52.353 --> 00:29:54.689
-I'll go set these up.
-Okay.

00:30:02.989 --> 00:30:05.074
Wait! Watch out!

00:30:05.158 --> 00:30:06.534
A flower’s life is short, you know.

00:30:06.618 --> 00:30:08.369
Please be gentle.

00:30:08.453 --> 00:30:09.954
-Sorry about that.
-Not at all.

00:30:10.038 --> 00:30:11.497
-I was in your way, huh?
-It's totally fine.

00:30:46.532 --> 00:30:51.621
This is Nonamare. If you have
any inquiries, please leave a message.

00:30:52.789 --> 00:30:57.293
Good day. I'm the new employee
who started yesterday.

00:30:57.794 --> 00:30:58.878
My name is Bunta.

00:30:59.629 --> 00:31:01.547
I’ve finished the three tasks

00:31:01.631 --> 00:31:04.634
you assigned me today.

00:31:05.343 --> 00:31:06.761
What would you like me to do next…?

00:31:08.179 --> 00:31:09.138
Mr. Suzuki?

00:31:14.435 --> 00:31:15.937
Excuse me!

00:31:18.481 --> 00:31:20.358
"Make sure he keeps
his umbrella with him all day."

00:31:23.069 --> 00:31:24.070
Where's his umbrella?

00:31:32.328 --> 00:31:34.288
But he did take it this morning.

00:31:36.374 --> 00:31:39.502
Here. You left these on the counter
at the convenience store.

00:31:40.211 --> 00:31:42.130
-Sorry?
-Your belongings.

00:31:44.632 --> 00:31:45.883
Thank you!

00:31:49.929 --> 00:31:50.972
Mr. Suzuki!

00:31:53.433 --> 00:31:54.726
Mr. Suzuki!

00:31:56.352 --> 00:31:58.730
Your umbrella! You left it at the store.

00:32:01.065 --> 00:32:02.608
Don't forget it again!

00:32:03.401 --> 00:32:04.527
Do I know you?

00:32:07.280 --> 00:32:09.073
I'm one of your neighbors.

00:32:10.241 --> 00:32:13.995
What a nice guy.
He's being way too friendly though.

00:32:16.080 --> 00:32:16.914
Too friendly?

00:32:19.584 --> 00:32:21.294
Excuse me for that. Thank you.

00:32:36.100 --> 00:32:38.186
UDON

00:32:50.406 --> 00:32:52.825
The curry here is kind of disappointing.

00:32:54.952 --> 00:32:56.746
Sorry, the space is kind of tight.

00:32:59.332 --> 00:33:02.627
-The curry here is not very good, is it?
-Right.

00:33:03.252 --> 00:33:05.129
I was just thinking that.

00:33:06.339 --> 00:33:09.801
Did you read my mind? Are you an Esper?

00:33:11.135 --> 00:33:12.136
-I'm like one.
-What?

00:33:15.223 --> 00:33:17.475
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

00:33:18.851 --> 00:33:20.603
I'll start dieting tomorrow.

00:33:20.686 --> 00:33:22.021
Excuse me. Sorry.

00:33:24.065 --> 00:33:25.775
I want to snuggle my cat.

00:33:26.275 --> 00:33:27.193
Sorry.

00:33:33.699 --> 00:33:35.493
That stock is sure to rise.

00:33:39.997 --> 00:33:41.082
Sorry.

00:33:46.754 --> 00:33:48.756
The green light actually looks turquoise.

00:33:50.174 --> 00:33:51.384
Sorry about that.

00:33:53.719 --> 00:33:54.929
I'll dash out
as soon as the light changes!

00:34:05.356 --> 00:34:07.567
My beard feels nice.

00:34:13.865 --> 00:34:15.616
I'm starving!

00:34:16.409 --> 00:34:17.785
Excuse me.

00:34:20.329 --> 00:34:23.249
-Are you okay?
-How lame and embarrassing!

00:34:23.791 --> 00:34:25.168
I'm fine.

00:34:27.128 --> 00:34:29.338
Our Happy Hour has started!

00:34:29.422 --> 00:34:33.009
Come on in! We’ve got beer
and highballs, all for 180 yen!

00:34:33.092 --> 00:34:34.260
Come on in!

00:34:34.343 --> 00:34:35.219
-I’ll take a flyer.
-Here you are.

00:34:36.429 --> 00:34:38.431
-I'm exhausted.
-Excuse me.

00:34:38.514 --> 00:34:39.682
Here you go.

00:34:40.183 --> 00:34:41.559
-Are you okay?
-I want to die.

00:34:41.642 --> 00:34:42.476
I'm good.

00:34:44.854 --> 00:34:48.107
Highballs and beer are only 180 yen!

00:34:48.191 --> 00:34:50.818
It's our Happy Hour!

00:34:58.326 --> 00:35:00.828
What am I doing, groveling like this?

00:35:09.837 --> 00:35:11.547
I won't be able to pay on time.

00:35:12.256 --> 00:35:14.425
Everyone but me seems to be having fun.

00:35:14.926 --> 00:35:19.472
I'll kill them all.

00:35:19.555 --> 00:35:21.140
Why am I even alive?

00:35:36.864 --> 00:35:37.823
Bunty!

00:35:50.586 --> 00:35:53.506
Are you tired? Is the job hard?

00:35:56.717 --> 00:36:00.429
I'm not sure.
I really don't know what's going on.

00:36:02.723 --> 00:36:06.310
-What kind of mission did you do today?
-Mission?

00:36:09.438 --> 00:36:12.900
I chose detergent for each fabric,
got out the stains,

00:36:12.984 --> 00:36:14.485
and ironed everything perfectly.

00:36:15.736 --> 00:36:16.946
Sounds like a dry cleaning shop.

00:36:18.155 --> 00:36:19.448
It is.

00:36:21.951 --> 00:36:23.536
A temporary guise, huh?

00:36:23.619 --> 00:36:26.330
I washed a ton of shirts today.

00:36:29.959 --> 00:36:33.671
A totally worn-out shirt…

00:36:34.839 --> 00:36:36.549
can’t be saved, don't you think?

00:36:39.218 --> 00:36:41.345
Your only option
is to throw it away, right?

00:36:46.517 --> 00:36:48.102
I’m an expert at making

00:36:48.185 --> 00:36:52.189
beat-up shirts look brand new
with a bit of starch.

00:36:58.195 --> 00:37:00.573
It’s almost the day of the fireworks.

00:37:02.199 --> 00:37:03.701
Are they going to be set off here?

00:37:03.784 --> 00:37:06.412
No, I mean the day you proposed to me.

00:37:09.040 --> 00:37:13.210
You seriously have
an overactive imagination.

00:37:13.878 --> 00:37:16.797
-Are you making fun of me?
-Of course not.

00:37:17.715 --> 00:37:20.176
You think I'm a high-maintenance woman,
don't you?

00:37:21.302 --> 00:37:22.803
Like a pickling stone?

00:37:22.887 --> 00:37:26.932
Pickles are pretty high maintenance, okay?
Plus, you gave me that stone, remember?

00:37:32.146 --> 00:37:35.399
A pickling stone? For my birthday?

00:37:37.151 --> 00:37:39.320
It's because you said you wanted one.

00:37:39.403 --> 00:37:43.657
I said I wanted to pickle cabbage,
but this isn’t exactly romantic.

00:37:44.408 --> 00:37:45.368
Here.

00:37:46.994 --> 00:37:48.913
‎-Oh!
‎-Whoa… that was close.

00:37:49.747 --> 00:37:52.041
-It's for you to use.
-Thanks.

00:37:54.919 --> 00:37:58.381
Even the pickling stone has a backstory?

00:37:59.507 --> 00:38:03.344
Wait. Is there a backstory
behind the proposal too?

00:38:04.261 --> 00:38:07.348
Backstory? It was normal.

00:38:07.932 --> 00:38:09.016
Normal?

00:38:13.896 --> 00:38:15.815
What did you just say?

00:38:22.696 --> 00:38:26.200
Will you… marry me?

00:38:32.081 --> 00:38:33.624
Was it too soon?

00:38:44.969 --> 00:38:46.220
I'm happy.

00:38:47.304 --> 00:38:48.305
I was waiting for it.

00:38:52.184 --> 00:38:53.269
That was dangerous.

00:38:53.352 --> 00:38:56.647
I almost started to believe
it all actually happened.

00:38:57.731 --> 00:38:59.567
You're really good at this.

00:39:00.359 --> 00:39:03.404
What do you mean?
You've been weird since yesterday.

00:39:04.822 --> 00:39:06.240
Shiki…

00:39:06.991 --> 00:39:09.201
Why would you go that far with this?

00:39:20.379 --> 00:39:22.965
Shiki!

00:39:24.967 --> 00:39:26.802
Mrs. Enjaku!

00:39:34.810 --> 00:39:36.353
Alrighty.

00:39:40.858 --> 00:39:42.902
So, you were an employee too?

00:39:44.987 --> 00:39:45.988
Sorry for not telling you.

00:39:46.655 --> 00:39:48.532
Is being a landlord your temporary guise?

00:39:48.616 --> 00:39:51.410
No, I help out
with managing the apartments.

00:39:51.494 --> 00:39:55.956
Try to get along with the people
around here as much as you can, okay?

00:39:59.293 --> 00:40:00.711
How's Shiki?

00:40:02.755 --> 00:40:06.050
There's something wrong with her,
if you ask me.

00:40:07.009 --> 00:40:09.178
Her acting is too good.

00:40:11.263 --> 00:40:12.515
She's not acting.

00:40:13.682 --> 00:40:14.517
Huh?

00:40:16.018 --> 00:40:19.104
Go along with the conversation.
That’s part of the job too.

00:40:22.441 --> 00:40:24.109
The job…

00:40:24.735 --> 00:40:26.529
Sasuke

00:40:27.738 --> 00:40:30.324
Walk, walk, walk

00:40:30.407 --> 00:40:32.535
TAKKOBI

00:40:32.618 --> 00:40:34.453
CLOSED

00:40:36.872 --> 00:40:39.708
-Good evening!
-Hello!

00:40:39.792 --> 00:40:41.377
Hi, Bunta!

00:40:45.506 --> 00:40:47.633
-Thank you for earlier.
-Shiki,

00:40:47.716 --> 00:40:49.134
these are for you.

00:40:49.218 --> 00:40:52.471
Thanks! I’ll put these in a vase.

00:40:54.932 --> 00:40:55.891
Huh?

00:40:56.725 --> 00:41:00.646
Did I make you jealous?
I already have someone I love.

00:41:00.729 --> 00:41:02.565
I’ll leave the role of Shiki's husband

00:41:03.107 --> 00:41:04.400
to you.

00:41:05.985 --> 00:41:07.319
A pleasure to meet you.

00:41:08.404 --> 00:41:09.321
My pleasure.

00:41:09.405 --> 00:41:12.491
Twist to the left, lock the joint,
break his balance, and take him down.

00:41:13.158 --> 00:41:14.368
It'll take two seconds.

00:41:16.870 --> 00:41:18.163
Please be nice to me.

00:41:21.959 --> 00:41:23.002
Looks good!

00:41:23.085 --> 00:41:27.881
Today's highlight was me slipping
a laxative into Takahashi’s café au lait.

00:41:27.965 --> 00:41:29.216
That is assault.

00:41:29.300 --> 00:41:32.177
Getting the police involved
is strictly forbidden. Be careful, okay?

00:41:32.261 --> 00:41:34.305
About café au lait, did you know that

00:41:34.388 --> 00:41:36.223
café means coffee,
and au lait means… a lot of me? Here.

00:41:37.224 --> 00:41:41.687
-Do you do missions like that every day?
-Let's drink.

00:41:41.770 --> 00:41:43.564
-It depends on the day.
-Right.

00:41:43.647 --> 00:41:44.940
-Here.
-Thanks.

00:41:45.566 --> 00:41:48.277
I haven’t done a single productive thing.

00:41:48.360 --> 00:41:51.530
It’s baffling that the company
is paying me for this.

00:41:51.614 --> 00:41:53.616
We’re not like a cash-strapped company.

00:41:53.699 --> 00:41:56.660
-The boss has plenty of assets.
-It's a pastime for the wealthy.

00:41:56.744 --> 00:41:59.997
It’s the boss’s way
of giving back to society.

00:42:00.539 --> 00:42:01.624
It's here!

00:42:03.751 --> 00:42:04.793
Let's check it.

00:42:05.336 --> 00:42:07.046
Mr. Suzuki from Mission 52.

00:42:07.129 --> 00:42:12.009
Thanks to having his umbrella,
he was able to pay off his debt.

00:42:12.092 --> 00:42:13.594
Mr. Sato from Mission 53.

00:42:13.677 --> 00:42:17.264
Thanks to waking up five minutes early,
he got promoted.

00:42:17.348 --> 00:42:19.141
Great!

00:42:19.224 --> 00:42:24.271
Mr. Takahashi from Mission 54. Thanks to
his dead battery, he can now get married.

00:42:24.355 --> 00:42:26.774
-Congrats to him!
-Yay!

00:42:27.358 --> 00:42:28.275
Wait a moment.

00:42:28.359 --> 00:42:29.943
-Yay!
-Excuse me, so…

00:42:30.653 --> 00:42:34.073
Mr. Suzuki was able to pay his debt.

00:42:34.156 --> 00:42:36.408
Mr. Sato was promoted.

00:42:36.492 --> 00:42:39.203
Mr. Takahashi got engaged.

00:42:39.286 --> 00:42:43.290
Are you saying all of that happened

00:42:43.374 --> 00:42:46.126
-because we completed today's missions?
-Yes.

00:42:46.210 --> 00:42:49.380
-No way…
-That's how it is!

00:42:49.463 --> 00:42:51.465
Every mission is important.

00:42:51.548 --> 00:42:54.510
Small efforts add up to save the world.

00:42:54.593 --> 00:42:55.844
Well said!

00:42:55.928 --> 00:42:56.762
Listen, everyone.

00:42:56.845 --> 00:42:59.264
You should be careful of scams.

00:42:59.348 --> 00:43:02.059
-Every small effort counts, right?
-Exactly.

00:43:02.142 --> 00:43:02.976
Yup.

00:43:03.519 --> 00:43:05.604
-What about your Esper power?!
-Did it appear yet?

00:43:05.688 --> 00:43:08.315
-Oh, right.
-What is it? Show us!

00:43:09.441 --> 00:43:11.735
Are all of you Espers?

00:43:18.242 --> 00:43:19.702
What kind of things can you do?

00:43:19.785 --> 00:43:23.539
-You go first! You're the new one!
-She's right!

00:43:23.622 --> 00:43:28.127
In my case, my ability
wouldn't work if people found out.

00:43:28.210 --> 00:43:30.629
-What's with that?
-I'm curious!

00:43:30.713 --> 00:43:32.172
Cut the act!

00:43:32.881 --> 00:43:34.007
I'll show you mine.

00:43:34.091 --> 00:43:35.342
Come! Hurry!

00:43:36.552 --> 00:43:38.178
Go, Ohsuke!

00:44:05.080 --> 00:44:08.751
No tricks, no gimmicks.
Flowers bloom when I stroke them.

00:44:08.834 --> 00:44:11.837
I'm Ohsuke, the plant-type Esper!

00:44:12.629 --> 00:44:14.339
Amazing!

00:44:16.049 --> 00:44:17.009
This is just…

00:44:17.676 --> 00:44:19.303
Wow, you're an awesome Esper!

00:44:20.804 --> 00:44:23.015
If word about Espers gets out,
you'll get fired.

00:44:28.270 --> 00:44:29.271
How do you do it?

00:44:29.354 --> 00:44:31.231
Huh? This? Like this…

00:44:31.315 --> 00:44:33.066
Awesome…

00:44:36.153 --> 00:44:37.529
Espers…?

00:44:39.531 --> 00:44:42.910
-Hey, flower-bloomer!
-It's always cherry blossom season!

00:44:42.993 --> 00:44:45.496
-Cherry blossoms are the best!
-Flowers everywhere!

00:44:45.579 --> 00:44:48.081
Leave the cherry blossoms to me!

00:44:48.165 --> 00:44:51.168
Cheers!

00:44:51.251 --> 00:44:52.586
Excuse me.

00:44:53.587 --> 00:44:57.758
Even if the flowers bloomed and we had
a picnic under them, what would it be for?

00:45:00.928 --> 00:45:02.930
-Cuz they're pretty.
-Right.

00:45:03.013 --> 00:45:04.473
They're so pretty.

00:45:05.057 --> 00:45:07.100
-That's it?
-Didn't you just say it was awesome?

00:45:07.184 --> 00:45:10.729
But we're supposed
to save the world, aren't we?

00:45:10.812 --> 00:45:12.356
Don't be so picky.

00:45:12.439 --> 00:45:15.025
How can we save the world
by blooming flowers?

00:45:17.027 --> 00:45:19.363
Don't argue!

00:45:19.446 --> 00:45:21.698
We're all just a bit Espers.

00:45:21.782 --> 00:45:23.742
-Just a bit.
-Right, Sasuke?

00:45:25.202 --> 00:45:26.954
Is he an Esper too?

00:45:27.037 --> 00:45:28.747
-Just a simple dog.
-Don't call him simple.

00:45:28.830 --> 00:45:30.290
-Just a simple dog?
-That's rude.

00:45:30.374 --> 00:45:33.335
-Eat up.
-Thanks!

00:45:33.418 --> 00:45:34.670
Thanks always.

00:45:34.753 --> 00:45:36.255
-Shiki, look at the yard.
-Looks delicious.

00:45:36.838 --> 00:45:37.673
Huh?

00:45:37.756 --> 00:45:39.132
The flowers are in full bloom.

00:45:39.633 --> 00:45:42.886
-Wow! But why?
-Aren't they pretty?

00:45:42.970 --> 00:45:44.513
They're beautiful!

00:45:45.305 --> 00:45:47.683
Keep the Espers a secret from Shiki.

00:45:47.766 --> 00:45:51.687
She’s not an employee, and she doesn’t
know about the missions to save the world.

00:45:53.647 --> 00:45:54.481
Just roll with her.

00:45:55.065 --> 00:45:57.109
-Me?
-Yup, you're her husband.

00:45:57.192 --> 00:45:58.110
But…

00:45:58.193 --> 00:46:00.612
Delicious!

00:46:00.696 --> 00:46:01.613
Are these stuffed pepers?

00:46:01.697 --> 00:46:03.657
They're out of this world!

00:46:06.535 --> 00:46:07.828
It's dark already.

00:46:08.829 --> 00:46:10.372
How is this possible?

00:46:12.833 --> 00:46:15.836
I wonder if they're blooming
according to Brazil’s time.

00:46:22.467 --> 00:46:23.594
They are beautiful.

00:46:26.888 --> 00:46:28.056
Very beautiful.

00:46:44.197 --> 00:46:45.532
I'm so happy.

00:46:46.366 --> 00:46:48.368
I want to stay like this forever.

00:46:53.415 --> 00:46:54.625
I love you.

00:47:14.853 --> 00:47:17.773
NONAMARE

00:47:18.440 --> 00:47:20.067
Sorry, it's from my workplace.

00:47:27.199 --> 00:47:29.785
-Hello?
-This is Kizashi.

00:47:29.868 --> 00:47:31.703
Thank you for completing the missions.

00:47:32.537 --> 00:47:34.289
Please keep up the good work.

00:47:34.373 --> 00:47:37.125
Yes, I'll do my best.

00:47:37.668 --> 00:47:40.420
You have to keep this a secret.

00:47:41.588 --> 00:47:43.423
-Yes.
-On top of that,

00:47:44.174 --> 00:47:46.968
there's an even more important rule
that you must follow.

00:47:47.803 --> 00:47:50.514
No one can know that I’m an Esper.

00:47:51.932 --> 00:47:53.266
That's the second one.

00:47:55.936 --> 00:47:58.230
What's the first one?

00:47:58.814 --> 00:48:00.357
It was presented to you from the start.

00:48:05.737 --> 00:48:06.905
Nonamare.

00:48:10.367 --> 00:48:11.868
"Non Amare."

00:48:14.204 --> 00:48:16.415
You must not love anyone.

00:48:44.276 --> 00:48:47.779
Mission: Prevent Mamoru Chida
from reaching the destination.

00:48:47.863 --> 00:48:49.656
What a loausy place.

00:48:49.740 --> 00:48:51.575
You! Don’t get in my way!

00:48:51.658 --> 00:48:53.285
We’re a married couple, right?

00:48:53.368 --> 00:48:54.995
-I want to go to the bathroom!
-Hold it.

00:48:55.078 --> 00:48:55.954
-I can't.
-Here.

00:48:56.037 --> 00:48:57.497
It won't fit in that!

00:48:57.581 --> 00:48:58.915
