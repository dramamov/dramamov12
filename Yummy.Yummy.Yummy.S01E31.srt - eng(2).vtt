00:01:46.070 --> 00:01:47.780
Whose wedding procession
is so magnificent?

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:49.470
It's really impressive.

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:50.400
Such a grand array.

00:01:51.550 --> 00:01:53.320
Mr. Lin is off to fetch his bride.

00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:54.910
What Mr. Lin?

00:01:54.910 --> 00:01:56.070
It's Mr. Cui.

00:01:56.680 --> 00:01:58.240
The Emperor helped the Cui family,

00:01:58.240 --> 00:01:59.830
so Mr. Lin changed his name back

00:01:59.830 --> 00:02:00.990
to Cui Che.

00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:02.990
He gave a grand gift at the first step,

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:04.350
and he's brought so much more now.

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:06.190
She's just a merchant's daughter.

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:07.830
Nonsense.

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:09.960
Mr. Cui hasn't taken a wife in 26 years.

00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:11.520
It's good enough that a lady

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:12.500
is willing to marry him.

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:14.550
With so many gifts,

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:15.680
Mr. Cui must

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:16.690
truly cherish Lady Shen.

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:17.670
Indeed.

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:19.240
Congratulations, Mr. Cui.

00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:20.080
Congratulations.

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:21.120
Congratulations, Mr. Cui.

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:21.960
Congratulations.

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:23.700
(Joy)

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:27.620
(Yunshui Manor)

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:40.400
That's quite a spectacle.

00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:41.870
Isn't it?

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:46.060
Congratulations.

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:50.900
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:56.670
Great.

00:02:56.680 --> 00:02:57.710
Wait, Mr. Cui.

00:02:57.990 --> 00:02:59.080
To marry my sister,

00:02:59.360 --> 00:03:01.080
you must first pass my test.

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:02.680
Our young master

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:03.830
is well-versed

00:03:03.830 --> 00:03:04.870
in poetry, music,

00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:06.270
history, and debate.

00:03:06.270 --> 00:03:07.800
Go ahead.

00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:09.080
Bring it on.

00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:10.080
Ask away.

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:14.560
Question.

00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:16.510
(Question 1)
Chickens and rabbits are in a cage.

00:03:16.510 --> 00:03:17.360
You can see 35 heads

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:19.270
and 94 feet.

00:03:19.270 --> 00:03:20.830
How many chickens

00:03:21.710 --> 00:03:23.030
and rabbits are there?

00:03:23.240 --> 00:03:24.520
Who blocks the door

00:03:24.520 --> 00:03:26.170
and tests with arithmetic at a wedding?

00:03:26.170 --> 00:03:27.520
- This is intentional.
- Exactly.

00:03:27.520 --> 00:03:28.650
You're making it hard for us.

00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:30.030
We're a family of merchants.

00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:31.200
Naturally, to join our family,

00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:32.490
one must be tested in arithmetic.

00:03:32.490 --> 00:03:33.270
Right?

00:03:33.270 --> 00:03:34.360
23 chickens.

00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:35.800
12 rabbits.

00:03:38.590 --> 00:03:39.430
I've read

00:03:39.590 --> 00:03:41.520
the Sunzi Suanjing.

00:03:41.520 --> 00:03:42.920
No need to set up variables?

00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:43.700
Is that right?

00:03:43.700 --> 00:03:45.030
- Is it right?
- Is it correct?

00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:45.870
Is it correct?

00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:47.120
It's correct.

00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:50.520
There's more.

00:03:50.520 --> 00:03:51.360
Question.

00:03:52.750 --> 00:03:54.550
(Question 2)
When candlelight passes

00:03:54.550 --> 00:03:56.120
through a small hole,

00:03:56.120 --> 00:03:57.550
what will it form on the wall

00:03:58.030 --> 00:03:58.920
on the other side?

00:03:58.920 --> 00:03:59.920
An inverted image.

00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:01.440
It's recorded in the Mohist Canon.

00:04:02.150 --> 00:04:02.990
Is it?

00:04:03.150 --> 00:04:04.080
I don't know.

00:04:04.550 --> 00:04:05.710
Our Vice Prefect

00:04:05.710 --> 00:04:07.270
is so brilliant.

00:04:08.310 --> 00:04:09.150
Next question.

00:04:09.430 --> 00:04:11.240
One faces south; the other faces north.

00:04:11.240 --> 00:04:13.290
Without turning around,
moving, or using a mirror,

00:04:13.290 --> 00:04:14.540
can they see

00:04:14.550 --> 00:04:16.750
each other's faces?

00:04:16.950 --> 00:04:17.790
Yes.

00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:20.510
Because they're facing each other.

00:04:21.280 --> 00:04:23.800
Facing each other.

00:04:23.900 --> 00:04:25.530
Facing each other.

00:04:26.430 --> 00:04:27.950
Mr. Cui knows everything.

00:04:28.150 --> 00:04:28.990
Next question.

00:04:28.990 --> 00:04:29.730
Question.

00:04:29.790 --> 00:04:31.190
(Question 4)
I was eating hot pot

00:04:31.190 --> 00:04:32.950
and accidentally overcooked
the beef tripe.

00:04:32.950 --> 00:04:34.000
I wanted to throw it away,

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:35.560
but why didn't I?

00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:36.550
This answer

00:04:36.950 --> 00:04:38.600
might offend you

00:04:39.750 --> 00:04:40.590
because

00:04:41.120 --> 00:04:42.920
you're not young either.

00:04:44.480 --> 00:04:45.390
Shen Shaojie,

00:04:45.390 --> 00:04:46.840
you're not young either.

00:04:49.190 --> 00:04:50.910
Did Shen Shaoguang
leak the answers to you?

00:04:51.070 --> 00:04:51.990
How could she do this?

00:04:51.990 --> 00:04:52.920
Next question.

00:04:52.920 --> 00:04:54.750
What does the bride want you to fetch?

00:04:54.750 --> 00:04:55.600
What

00:04:55.800 --> 00:04:56.640
is it?

00:04:57.360 --> 00:04:58.200
Fetch her.

00:05:00.120 --> 00:05:02.240
Fetch her!

00:05:02.240 --> 00:05:03.720
You even know cheesy pickup lines?

00:05:04.160 --> 00:05:05.000
You...

00:05:05.600 --> 00:05:06.440
I don't believe it.

00:05:06.600 --> 00:05:07.440
One more.

00:05:08.750 --> 00:05:10.390
You'll never get this one.

00:05:10.390 --> 00:05:12.060
(Joy)

00:05:22.060 --> 00:05:24.540
(Clear and Bright)

00:05:40.870 --> 00:05:42.310
How is it? Look.

00:05:42.310 --> 00:05:43.190
Is it symmetrical?

00:05:43.720 --> 00:05:44.660
- Auntie.
- So pretty.

00:05:46.310 --> 00:05:47.150
Auntie,

00:05:47.920 --> 00:05:48.870
Uncle

00:05:49.040 --> 00:05:50.190
answered all those questions.

00:05:50.510 --> 00:05:52.070
Dad is making him recite

00:05:52.220 --> 00:05:53.720
tongue twisters.

00:05:55.990 --> 00:05:57.360
Milady, you mustn't go soft.

00:05:57.870 --> 00:05:59.510
Let them block the door a bit longer.

00:05:59.510 --> 00:06:01.390
We can't let them in so easily.

00:06:01.640 --> 00:06:02.480
No.

00:06:02.480 --> 00:06:03.550
I want to hear him recite

00:06:03.550 --> 00:06:05.040
tongue twisters.

00:06:05.430 --> 00:06:06.480
I know,

00:06:06.630 --> 00:06:07.750
but you have to wait.

00:06:08.310 --> 00:06:09.310
Sit and wait.

00:06:10.480 --> 00:06:11.390
Auntie,

00:06:11.390 --> 00:06:12.680
Uncle was right.

00:06:12.950 --> 00:06:14.200
He anticipated that you'd want

00:06:14.200 --> 00:06:15.410
to see his embarrassment,

00:06:15.440 --> 00:06:16.510
so he asked me to secretly

00:06:16.510 --> 00:06:17.780
(Joy)
bring you a letter.

00:06:18.190 --> 00:06:20.360
This must be a marriage poem
from Mr. Cui.

00:06:20.360 --> 00:06:21.430
They all do this,

00:06:21.430 --> 00:06:22.840
write some sweet nothings

00:06:22.840 --> 00:06:23.970
to urge the bride to leave.

00:06:24.040 --> 00:06:25.550
You mustn't fall for it.

00:06:26.310 --> 00:06:27.480
It's just a poem.

00:06:27.750 --> 00:06:29.040
I won't fall for it.

00:06:29.310 --> 00:06:30.360
What's this?

00:06:32.480 --> 00:06:33.320
A deed.

00:06:37.390 --> 00:06:38.390
A marriage deed.

00:06:38.390 --> 00:06:39.920
This shop is gifted to you.

00:06:39.920 --> 00:06:40.950
Please help me.

00:06:45.840 --> 00:06:47.600
This is the right way to urge the bride.

00:06:49.540 --> 00:06:50.780
(Joy in our family)

00:06:53.740 --> 00:06:55.500
(We're getting married)

00:06:55.500 --> 00:06:56.780
(Happy marriage)

00:07:01.240 --> 00:07:02.840
Greetings, Your Highness.

00:07:04.280 --> 00:07:05.430
- This way.
- Please.

00:07:07.740 --> 00:07:08.800
Come here, Your Highness.

00:07:08.800 --> 00:07:09.750
Please sit here.

00:07:11.070 --> 00:07:12.320
Your Highness, please be seated.

00:07:18.430 --> 00:07:19.270
Mr. and Mrs. Shen.

00:07:21.920 --> 00:07:22.990
Please sit first.

00:07:25.990 --> 00:07:27.430
What's the matter, Vice Minister Cao?

00:07:27.430 --> 00:07:28.840
I've never seen the wording

00:07:29.310 --> 00:07:30.840
of this wedding ceremony before.

00:07:31.310 --> 00:07:33.600
And there are requirements
for the intonation.

00:07:34.070 --> 00:07:35.840
Shall I read it aloud

00:07:36.070 --> 00:07:37.360
for you two to listen?

00:07:37.360 --> 00:07:38.310
- Sure.
- Sure.

00:07:38.310 --> 00:07:39.280
You go ahead.

00:07:40.840 --> 00:07:42.750
Distinguished guests,

00:07:43.120 --> 00:07:44.870
friends, and relatives,

00:07:45.240 --> 00:07:46.750
- you...
- Vice Minister Cao.

00:07:47.390 --> 00:07:48.390
You're so professional.

00:07:48.550 --> 00:07:49.720
Amazing.

00:07:49.720 --> 00:07:51.040
You don't seem like someone

00:07:51.040 --> 00:07:52.370
who was just trained last night.

00:07:52.370 --> 00:07:52.990
Yeah.

00:07:52.990 --> 00:07:54.800
You look like you've been hosting

00:07:54.800 --> 00:07:56.120
for over a decade.

00:07:56.120 --> 00:07:57.630
Extremely professional.

00:07:57.870 --> 00:07:58.710
Host?

00:08:00.070 --> 00:08:02.600
Is the term from monasteries?

00:08:02.750 --> 00:08:03.430
No, no.

00:08:03.430 --> 00:08:04.630
There must be some connection

00:08:04.630 --> 00:08:05.720
between a host and an abbot.

00:08:05.720 --> 00:08:06.560
- No.
- No.

00:08:06.560 --> 00:08:07.870
I haven't taken monastic vows.

00:08:07.870 --> 00:08:09.040
How could I be a host?

00:08:09.040 --> 00:08:10.510
- No.
- Vice Minister Cao.

00:08:10.510 --> 00:08:11.510
Listen.

00:08:11.510 --> 00:08:14.430
- This has nothing to do with that.
- Yes.

00:08:14.430 --> 00:08:15.720
- Don't worry.
- Okay.

00:08:15.720 --> 00:08:17.630
May I make a small suggestion?

00:08:17.630 --> 00:08:18.510
Go ahead.

00:08:18.510 --> 00:08:20.480
For the atmosphere,

00:08:20.480 --> 00:08:21.320
could we all

00:08:21.600 --> 00:08:22.440
smile,

00:08:22.840 --> 00:08:23.680
showing

00:08:24.120 --> 00:08:25.310
at least eight teeth?

00:08:25.510 --> 00:08:26.840
Let me demonstrate.

00:08:26.840 --> 00:08:27.920
Look at this.

00:08:27.920 --> 00:08:28.760
Look.

00:08:30.720 --> 00:08:32.080
Like this.

00:08:35.080 --> 00:08:37.360
Distinguished guests,

00:08:38.270 --> 00:08:39.320
friends, and relatives,

00:08:39.990 --> 00:08:40.830
you...

00:08:41.120 --> 00:08:42.390
I've found the feeling.

00:08:42.390 --> 00:08:43.960
- Right?
- I'll practice more.

00:08:43.960 --> 00:08:45.150
- Go ahead.
- Sure.

00:08:45.750 --> 00:08:46.960
- How nice,
- Friends...

00:08:47.480 --> 00:08:48.390
Come, sit down.

00:08:52.840 --> 00:08:53.680
Fengxia,

00:08:54.750 --> 00:08:56.720
should I sit like this

00:08:56.990 --> 00:08:57.830
or

00:08:58.390 --> 00:08:59.390
like this?

00:08:59.390 --> 00:09:00.750
Why? Are you nervous?

00:09:00.750 --> 00:09:01.590
Not exactly.

00:09:01.720 --> 00:09:03.390
Just sit however you feel comfortable.

00:09:03.600 --> 00:09:04.560
Like me.

00:09:04.720 --> 00:09:05.840
Isn't it fine?

00:09:05.840 --> 00:09:06.960
Okay, I'll adjust it.

00:09:06.960 --> 00:09:07.800
I'll adjust it.

00:09:10.480 --> 00:09:11.320
Fengxia.

00:09:11.790 --> 00:09:12.750
Mr. Pei.

00:09:15.240 --> 00:09:16.960
- He can't sit there.
- Exactly.

00:09:16.960 --> 00:09:17.800
- Mr. Pei.
- Hurry.

00:09:19.630 --> 00:09:20.480
Mr. Pei.

00:09:20.750 --> 00:09:22.560
I'm so sorry.

00:09:22.960 --> 00:09:24.080
How could you sit here?

00:09:24.360 --> 00:09:25.600
I'm so busy.

00:09:25.600 --> 00:09:26.720
You should sit over there.

00:09:26.720 --> 00:09:28.270
- You should sit there.
- Come.

00:09:28.270 --> 00:09:29.150
- Where?
- Come.

00:09:29.150 --> 00:09:30.200
Over there.

00:09:30.360 --> 00:09:31.990
How could I sit there?

00:09:32.200 --> 00:09:33.390
That's for the elders.

00:09:33.790 --> 00:09:35.270
You two are the elders

00:09:35.270 --> 00:09:36.510
of the bride and groom.

00:09:36.510 --> 00:09:38.240
How could I sit there?

00:09:38.240 --> 00:09:39.360
You are an elder.

00:09:39.360 --> 00:09:40.630
Yes, you are an elder.

00:09:40.630 --> 00:09:41.790
Hurry up.

00:09:41.790 --> 00:09:42.630
Now,

00:09:42.630 --> 00:09:43.510
I am

00:09:43.510 --> 00:09:45.990
already the Vice Censor-in-Chief.

00:09:45.990 --> 00:09:46.840
Yes.

00:09:46.840 --> 00:09:48.090
A Rank V official.

00:09:48.090 --> 00:09:48.980
A full rank.

00:09:48.990 --> 00:09:50.050
Yes, yes.

00:09:50.050 --> 00:09:51.670
Still inappropriate for me to sit there.

00:09:51.670 --> 00:09:53.080
It's appropriate.

00:09:53.080 --> 00:09:54.240
- Inappropriate.
- Sit.

00:09:54.750 --> 00:09:55.750
I insist.

00:09:55.750 --> 00:09:57.390
- I can't.
- I insist.

00:09:57.390 --> 00:09:58.360
Please go attend

00:09:58.360 --> 00:10:00.600
to the other guests, okay?

00:10:00.600 --> 00:10:01.630
I'll sit here.

00:10:01.630 --> 00:10:02.750
It's fine.

00:10:02.750 --> 00:10:04.390
This isn't right.

00:10:04.390 --> 00:10:05.230
Alright.

00:10:05.750 --> 00:10:06.600
Go, go.

00:10:06.600 --> 00:10:07.960
You sit here.

00:10:08.500 --> 00:10:09.560
Have some tea or something.

00:10:09.560 --> 00:10:11.080
Okay, okay.

00:10:22.120 --> 00:10:23.080
Stop crying.

00:10:23.360 --> 00:10:24.390
Stop crying.

00:10:26.990 --> 00:10:28.150
This one's all wet.

00:10:28.150 --> 00:10:28.990
Use this one.

00:10:29.710 --> 00:10:31.440
Mr. Cui and Lady Shen
are getting married.

00:10:31.440 --> 00:10:32.720
Why are you crying here?

00:10:32.990 --> 00:10:34.200
You heartless chef.

00:10:34.200 --> 00:10:35.120
What do you know?

00:10:43.960 --> 00:10:45.360
Getting married in the diner

00:10:45.410 --> 00:10:47.120
and spending the night at Yunshui Manor?

00:10:48.080 --> 00:10:49.870
This place is limited.

00:10:50.240 --> 00:10:51.440
Yunshui Manor is spacious.

00:10:51.670 --> 00:10:53.090
Besides, I've thought of that place

00:10:53.090 --> 00:10:54.320
as my home.

00:10:54.320 --> 00:10:55.440
I've grown attached to it.

00:10:59.840 --> 00:11:00.680
Mr. Shen,

00:11:01.080 --> 00:11:02.870
how much did you get from Mr. Cui?

00:11:07.080 --> 00:11:07.990
Oh, you mean this?

00:11:10.080 --> 00:11:11.030
Let me tell you.

00:11:11.840 --> 00:11:12.680
If a man is willing

00:11:13.080 --> 00:11:14.750
to spend money on you,

00:11:15.120 --> 00:11:16.590
it doesn't mean he loves you so much.

00:11:16.630 --> 00:11:17.870
But if a man

00:11:17.870 --> 00:11:19.360
isn't willing to spend money on you,

00:11:19.600 --> 00:11:21.090
he definitely thinks of you as a fool.

00:11:21.440 --> 00:11:23.440
I'm testing Mr. Cui for my sister.

00:11:24.670 --> 00:11:25.510
You used to want

00:11:25.720 --> 00:11:26.990
to be my brother-in-law, right?

00:11:27.400 --> 00:11:28.270
Look at Mr. Cui.

00:11:28.270 --> 00:11:29.600
Look at his initiative.

00:11:29.600 --> 00:11:30.240
Look at you.

00:11:30.240 --> 00:11:31.360
Listen. With you like this,

00:11:31.360 --> 00:11:32.640
forget about marrying my sister.

00:11:32.640 --> 00:11:33.200
Which lady

00:11:33.200 --> 00:11:34.390
would marry you?

00:11:34.390 --> 00:11:35.230
You must be kidding.

00:11:35.390 --> 00:11:37.080
I don't think it's easier for you.

00:11:38.390 --> 00:11:39.230
It's not?

00:11:41.440 --> 00:11:42.630
What's wrong with me?

00:11:44.870 --> 00:11:46.600
You don't know the value of money.

00:11:46.970 --> 00:11:48.210
When I heard that the Prefecture

00:11:48.240 --> 00:11:49.990
was helping the Cui family
clear their name,

00:11:50.100 --> 00:11:51.670
I told them everything I knew.

00:11:51.670 --> 00:11:53.720
Who would've known he was Cui Che?

00:11:54.600 --> 00:11:56.440
I always suspected Cui Che wasn't dead.

00:11:56.790 --> 00:11:58.720
He loved making handicrafts
when he was a child.

00:11:58.870 --> 00:12:00.120
Knowing he was betrothed,

00:12:00.120 --> 00:12:01.510
he asked what use a wife would be

00:12:01.840 --> 00:12:03.560
and if she could make his gadgets spin.

00:12:03.960 --> 00:12:05.600
Such a pesky kid couldn't die.

00:12:07.240 --> 00:12:08.270
I forgot to ask just now.

00:12:08.560 --> 00:12:09.510
Who are you?

00:12:10.270 --> 00:12:11.480
I'm Jingwen.

00:12:12.790 --> 00:12:14.030
Try some; it's very sweet.

00:12:14.030 --> 00:12:15.400
No, thank you.

00:12:20.910 --> 00:12:22.960
Distinguished guests,

00:12:23.600 --> 00:12:24.960
friends, and relatives,

00:12:25.560 --> 00:12:28.150
it's a joyous occasion today.

00:12:28.670 --> 00:12:30.510
We have all gathered here

00:12:30.720 --> 00:12:33.270
to witness the union of Mr. Cui

00:12:33.560 --> 00:12:35.270
and Lady Shen.

00:12:36.120 --> 00:12:39.390
Now, let us give the warmest applause

00:12:39.670 --> 00:12:41.200
to welcome

00:12:41.510 --> 00:12:42.510
the newlyweds.

00:12:42.510 --> 00:12:43.920
Good, good.

00:13:30.080 --> 00:13:31.030
Water has its source;

00:13:31.360 --> 00:13:32.440
trees have their roots;

00:13:32.990 --> 00:13:35.390
children never forget
their parents' kindness.

00:13:36.360 --> 00:13:37.440
Newlyweds,

00:13:37.840 --> 00:13:39.440

(Joy)

00:16:35.040 --> 00:16:37.230
This is what we call
a sense of relaxation back home.

00:16:37.360 --> 00:16:38.960
Do you have a second opinion?

00:16:40.270 --> 00:16:41.110
How dare I?

00:16:41.790 --> 00:16:42.750
What are you looking at?

00:16:49.630 --> 00:16:50.630
It's from the Princess.

00:17:12.320 --> 00:17:14.280
Shouldn't you learn it first?

00:17:17.870 --> 00:17:18.710
No need.

00:17:24.470 --> 00:17:25.630
You are really...

00:17:59.910 --> 00:18:00.750
Actually,

00:18:02.120 --> 00:18:03.470
we suddenly got married

00:18:04.190 --> 00:18:05.360
because of me.

00:18:06.710 --> 00:18:08.810
We haven't had a chance
to spend any time together.

00:18:09.760 --> 00:18:10.600
How about

00:18:11.120 --> 00:18:12.230
tonight we just...

00:18:19.150 --> 00:18:21.120
Are you making excuses?

00:18:21.760 --> 00:18:22.630
Indeed.

00:18:22.630 --> 00:18:24.520
You should take some time to learn.

00:19:32.820 --> 00:19:36.700
(Capital Prefecture)

00:19:39.040 --> 00:19:40.360
Dear, let me.

Dear.

00:19:47.390 --> 00:19:48.230
Come on.

00:19:50.080 --> 00:19:51.120
Congratulations, Mr. Cui,

00:19:51.150 --> 00:19:52.000
on your marriage

00:19:52.230 --> 00:19:53.520
and your restoration to office.

- Congrats.
- Congrats.

It's all thanks to all of you.

00:20:01.140 --> 00:20:02.420
Congratulations

00:20:02.420 --> 00:20:04.140
on a 20% increase in your salaries

00:20:04.140 --> 00:20:06.020
and merits in the Merit Office.

00:20:06.180 --> 00:20:07.060
Your future promotions

00:20:07.380 --> 00:20:08.460
are boundless.

00:20:08.820 --> 00:20:10.420
Thank you, Mr. Cui.

00:20:15.500 --> 00:20:16.340
Please, have a seat.

00:20:16.540 --> 00:20:17.380
Sit.

00:20:17.900 --> 00:20:19.460
This is our new dish,

00:20:19.460 --> 00:20:20.340
the Ten-Flavor Crab.

00:20:20.490 --> 00:20:21.560
Everyone, please taste it.

00:20:21.820 --> 00:20:23.140
Thank you, Mrs. Cui.

00:20:30.420 --> 00:20:31.580
The Ten-Flavor Crab,

00:20:31.580 --> 00:20:32.700
as the name suggests,

00:20:32.860 --> 00:20:34.540
is crab prepared in ten flavors?

00:20:35.180 --> 00:20:37.100
Traditional marinated, steamed,

00:20:37.100 --> 00:20:38.140
and pepper crab.

00:20:38.140 --> 00:20:41.020
Also, stir-fried, deep-fried, pickled,
scallion oil, and drunken crab.

00:20:41.020 --> 00:20:42.020
This one is baked crab

00:20:42.020 --> 00:20:43.820
made with cheese extracted from milk.

00:20:44.140 --> 00:20:45.900
This one is my father's creation,

00:20:46.120 --> 00:20:47.980
crab steamed with rice wine
and cinnamon.

00:20:48.260 --> 00:20:49.700
But it's only available now.

00:20:50.060 --> 00:20:51.100
Everyone, please taste it.

00:20:53.420 --> 00:20:54.540
- Eat up.
- Yes.

00:20:54.540 --> 00:20:55.580
- Taste it.
- Here.

00:20:56.560 --> 00:20:57.400
It seems quite good.

00:20:58.880 --> 00:20:59.720
It looks fresh.

00:21:06.300 --> 00:21:07.300
But Lady Shen...

00:21:08.300 --> 00:21:09.780
Mrs. Cui.

00:21:10.500 --> 00:21:12.180
What did you mean by saying

00:21:12.180 --> 00:21:13.700
it's only available now?

00:21:14.660 --> 00:21:15.720
My parents had

00:21:15.720 --> 00:21:17.500
a quarrel recently,

00:21:17.500 --> 00:21:18.460
but they've made up.

00:21:18.460 --> 00:21:19.840
My father said that in a few days,

00:21:19.840 --> 00:21:22.140
he'll take my mother to Jiangnan
to explore new cuisines,

00:21:22.140 --> 00:21:23.320
and no one will be making it.

00:21:23.340 --> 00:21:24.420
That's true.

00:21:25.660 --> 00:21:27.380
Oh, it's been a long time
since we've seen

00:21:27.380 --> 00:21:28.220
Shen Shaojie.

00:21:28.460 --> 00:21:29.300
Yes.

00:21:29.450 --> 00:21:30.900
Where has he gone?

00:21:30.900 --> 00:21:32.660
My brother and Mr. Liu

00:21:32.660 --> 00:21:34.540
have gone to open a branch of our diner.

00:21:35.220 --> 00:21:38.260
Your brother.

00:21:38.820 --> 00:21:39.820
What else?

00:21:39.820 --> 00:21:41.900
Their diner.

00:21:50.620 --> 00:21:52.020
Dear, taste this.

00:22:06.180 --> 00:22:07.140
Look at them.

00:22:13.580 --> 00:22:14.420
Focused on eating.

00:22:28.140 --> 00:22:30.180
Everyone, take a look.

00:22:30.940 --> 00:22:31.780
Today,

00:22:31.940 --> 00:22:33.730
Shen's Diner Third Branch

00:22:33.750 --> 00:22:35.400
(Shen's Diner Third Branch)
is launching

00:22:35.400 --> 00:22:37.060
a children's nutritious lunch box.

00:22:37.300 --> 00:22:39.180
We hope everyone passing by

00:22:39.260 --> 00:22:40.100
won't miss out.

00:22:40.100 --> 00:22:41.020
Okay?

00:22:41.020 --> 00:22:42.060
Feel free to look.

00:22:42.060 --> 00:22:43.980
In the past,
when I prepared lunch for my son,

00:22:43.980 --> 00:22:45.700
by the time he went to eat at noon,

00:22:45.940 --> 00:22:47.560
the food was all cold.

00:22:47.560 --> 00:22:48.500
I have the same trouble.

00:22:48.500 --> 00:22:49.620
Thanks to Handsome Shen,

00:22:49.620 --> 00:22:51.540
who came up with the idea
of a lunch box,

00:22:51.860 --> 00:22:52.820
my son finally

00:22:52.820 --> 00:22:53.940
got to eat hot meals.

00:22:53.940 --> 00:22:56.460
Yes, the children's meal he made

00:22:56.460 --> 00:22:58.060
is colorful, fragrant, and delicious,

00:22:58.060 --> 00:22:59.780
and the design is adorable.

00:22:59.940 --> 00:23:02.060
My child is craving this.

00:23:02.060 --> 00:23:03.020
You flatter me.

00:23:03.020 --> 00:23:04.260
Your praise

00:23:04.260 --> 00:23:05.660
is too kind.

00:23:05.660 --> 00:23:06.740
I dare not accept it.

00:23:08.420 --> 00:23:09.620
We're not flattering you.

00:23:09.620 --> 00:23:10.620
You deserve it.

00:23:10.820 --> 00:23:12.220
At Hongwen Academy,

00:23:12.220 --> 00:23:13.860
Yangyang often tells my son

00:23:13.860 --> 00:23:15.620
that in her heart,

00:23:15.620 --> 00:23:17.420
you're the most reliable father.

00:23:18.220 --> 00:23:19.820
Yes, I know.

00:23:19.980 --> 00:23:21.780
Does Yangyang truly say so?

00:23:21.780 --> 00:23:23.380
- Yes.
- I know, too.

00:23:27.660 --> 00:23:29.380
(Fatherly love is like a mountain)

00:23:34.140 --> 00:23:35.020
Ladies,

00:23:35.020 --> 00:23:35.900
I dare not accept

00:23:36.020 --> 00:23:37.820
other praises,

00:23:39.260 --> 00:23:41.140
but becoming a father Yangyang can trust

00:23:41.420 --> 00:23:42.300
has indeed been

00:23:42.300 --> 00:23:43.540
my constant pursuit.

00:23:44.540 --> 00:23:45.420
So, let's get down

00:23:45.420 --> 00:23:47.260
to business.

00:23:52.380 --> 00:23:53.420
Don't worry, everyone.

00:23:53.420 --> 00:23:55.460
Today, our children's lunch box

00:23:55.460 --> 00:23:57.540
is only 3 qian each.

00:23:57.860 --> 00:23:58.780
I hope you...

00:23:58.780 --> 00:24:00.340
Handsome Shen.

00:24:00.340 --> 00:24:01.380
Alright.

00:24:01.380 --> 00:24:02.260
Don't rush.

00:24:02.260 --> 00:24:03.120
Alright, everyone.

00:24:03.120 --> 00:24:04.460
Everyone will get one.

00:24:05.560 --> 00:24:06.440
I want one.

00:24:06.660 --> 00:24:07.550
I want one, too.

00:24:08.980 --> 00:24:10.860
(Hongwen Academy)

00:24:10.860 --> 00:24:12.160
The top performer

00:24:12.540 --> 00:24:14.370
in this school exam is

00:24:16.100 --> 00:24:17.340
Shen Yangyang.

00:24:21.400 --> 00:24:22.490
Thank you.

00:24:23.140 --> 00:24:24.100
Thank you, everyone.

00:24:24.860 --> 00:24:25.700
Shen Yangyang,

00:24:25.820 --> 00:24:28.900
you used to be unfamiliar
with the Four Books and Five Classics,

00:24:28.980 --> 00:24:31.140
but today you can answer fluently

00:24:31.140 --> 00:24:33.420
and even be flexible in your essays.

00:24:33.740 --> 00:24:35.900
How did you manage that?

00:24:36.100 --> 00:24:37.220
Is it hard?

00:24:37.340 --> 00:24:39.300
Just don't study rigidly.

00:24:39.460 --> 00:24:40.660
When the mentor explains,

00:24:40.660 --> 00:24:42.340
he always focuses on the wording.

00:24:42.580 --> 00:24:44.020
Although it's correct,

00:24:44.180 --> 00:24:45.540
it stifles creativity

00:24:45.690 --> 00:24:47.100
and limits perspectives.

00:24:47.460 --> 00:24:49.840
We should understand
the principles ourselves

00:24:50.160 --> 00:24:52.310
and not always think
that the authorities are right.

00:24:52.380 --> 00:24:53.450
Shen Yangyang, you...

00:24:55.740 --> 00:24:56.580
I think

00:24:57.580 --> 00:24:58.780
Yangyang has a point.

00:25:02.940 --> 00:25:03.940
Thank you, everyone.

00:25:04.460 --> 00:25:07.500
Censor Pei, congrats on your promotion.

00:25:08.100 --> 00:25:09.500
You've focused on working.

00:25:09.780 --> 00:25:12.140
Now, you've finally achieved your wish.

00:25:13.100 --> 00:25:14.220
With the increased salary,

00:25:14.460 --> 00:25:15.860
you can bring your mother

00:25:15.860 --> 00:25:17.340
to live in Yong'an.

00:25:17.700 --> 00:25:18.980
The carriage is all arranged.

00:25:19.380 --> 00:25:21.020
Mother will arrive soon.

00:25:22.060 --> 00:25:23.300
Thank you for your care.

00:25:23.860 --> 00:25:26.420
Now, you're willing to call me

00:25:27.060 --> 00:25:28.180
Censor Pei today.

00:25:34.700 --> 00:25:36.220
Actually, I understand

00:25:37.740 --> 00:25:39.460
your intentions.

00:25:42.980 --> 00:25:44.700
My clan is prominent.

00:25:45.420 --> 00:25:46.540
In the clan,

00:25:46.780 --> 00:25:48.100
I am the 47th.

00:25:48.820 --> 00:25:51.020
I'm embarrassed to mention it to others.

00:25:51.700 --> 00:25:53.100
In our branch,

00:25:53.100 --> 00:25:54.380
I am already the 12th.

00:25:55.180 --> 00:25:56.660
I can't benefit from the clan's glory.

00:25:57.220 --> 00:25:59.740
With the successive deaths
of the elders,

00:26:00.360 --> 00:26:02.400
I've delayed entering the Capital
due to mourning.

00:26:02.460 --> 00:26:03.620
I am already old

00:26:03.900 --> 00:26:05.620
and have only just entered
the Censorate.

00:26:06.380 --> 00:26:08.300
I have never proposed to anyone

00:26:08.940 --> 00:26:10.740
because I come from a prominent clan,

00:26:11.460 --> 00:26:12.740
but I'm from a humble background.

00:26:13.180 --> 00:26:14.060
How could I

00:26:14.060 --> 00:26:15.940
burden a good lady?

00:26:16.940 --> 00:26:18.060
My father passed away early;

00:26:18.860 --> 00:26:21.180
my mother has been the one to carry on.

00:26:21.780 --> 00:26:24.260
I'll definitely live with my mother.

00:26:25.020 --> 00:26:27.180
It is I who has received
my mother's grace,

00:26:27.180 --> 00:26:28.780
not my future wife.

00:26:28.780 --> 00:26:31.100
How could I force someone else
to be filial?

00:26:31.620 --> 00:26:33.260
With my meager salary,

00:26:33.260 --> 00:26:35.260
how could I support two women

00:26:35.260 --> 00:26:36.980
and future children?

00:26:38.860 --> 00:26:40.260
If you had accepted me,

00:26:41.100 --> 00:26:43.300
all of this would've been solved easily.

00:26:43.660 --> 00:26:44.580
Why bother?

00:26:45.460 --> 00:26:46.740
You're precious and noble.

00:26:46.740 --> 00:26:48.020
In my eyes,

00:26:48.420 --> 00:26:50.020
you are like a deity.

00:26:50.420 --> 00:26:52.540
Why go through the trouble

00:26:52.660 --> 00:26:53.500
of stooping down

00:26:53.500 --> 00:26:54.900
into my mire?

00:26:55.620 --> 00:26:56.620
I live alone,

00:26:56.620 --> 00:26:57.800
supporting my widowed mother,

00:26:57.980 --> 00:26:59.500
and I feel quite at ease in my heart.

00:26:59.940 --> 00:27:01.540
But if someone else were to join me,

00:27:02.900 --> 00:27:05.900
it'd reveal the hardships of my life.

00:27:12.940 --> 00:27:14.460
I can afford it.

00:27:14.460 --> 00:27:15.500
But I can't accept it.

00:27:16.540 --> 00:27:17.380
Also,

00:27:19.660 --> 00:27:20.860
I'm not willing to accept it.

00:27:26.660 --> 00:27:27.660
All along,

00:27:30.260 --> 00:27:31.500
I have only known

00:27:31.500 --> 00:27:33.100
how to live clumsily.

00:27:33.540 --> 00:27:34.780
That's why I am suited

00:27:34.780 --> 00:27:37.460
to be an official in the Censorate.

00:27:38.020 --> 00:27:38.980
I believe

00:27:39.620 --> 00:27:41.020
that I can do more

00:27:41.020 --> 00:27:42.620
for you,

00:27:42.620 --> 00:27:44.060
for His Majesty's court,

00:27:44.340 --> 00:27:45.860
and for this vast land.

00:27:46.460 --> 00:27:47.820
But if I were to marry you

00:27:48.510 --> 00:27:50.700
or a close lover of yours,

00:27:52.540 --> 00:27:54.660
I wouldn't be able to be a good censor.

00:27:55.660 --> 00:27:58.300
With myself entangled with you,

00:27:58.620 --> 00:28:01.940
how could I have to criticize others?

00:28:06.940 --> 00:28:08.220
I am filled with trepidation.

00:28:09.820 --> 00:28:11.500
Please forgive me.

00:28:12.220 --> 00:28:13.220
In that case,

00:28:13.940 --> 00:28:15.820
I shall ask you one last question.

00:28:16.580 --> 00:28:17.420
I've loved you.

00:28:20.740 --> 00:28:21.580
That day,

00:28:23.100 --> 00:28:24.220
you asked me

00:28:24.900 --> 00:28:26.660
if I'd ever been sincere for a moment.

00:28:28.260 --> 00:28:29.100
At that time,

00:28:31.300 --> 00:28:32.540
I lied.

00:28:33.700 --> 00:28:34.540
In truth,

00:28:36.220 --> 00:28:38.180
it was more than just a moment
of sincerity.

00:28:39.900 --> 00:28:40.980
I dare to admit

00:28:41.460 --> 00:28:43.060
that I have fallen in love

00:28:43.620 --> 00:28:45.140
with you.

00:29:04.980 --> 00:29:05.900
What are you thinking?

00:29:07.820 --> 00:29:09.380
I just wanted to ask you

00:29:10.860 --> 00:29:12.300
how we should interact

00:29:12.740 --> 00:29:14.300
when we meet again.

00:29:19.860 --> 00:29:20.700
Your Highness,

00:29:21.540 --> 00:29:22.780
you're the Princess.

00:29:23.300 --> 00:29:24.140
I am

00:29:25.740 --> 00:29:27.060
but a subordinate.

00:30:18.820 --> 00:30:19.940
Lin Yan.

00:30:21.660 --> 00:30:23.060
Cui Che.

00:30:23.580 --> 00:30:27.460
I want you to suffer as well.

00:30:44.820 --> 00:30:46.060
Mr. Cui,

00:30:47.140 --> 00:30:48.340
please listen to the question.

00:30:49.860 --> 00:30:50.700
Go ahead.

00:30:52.740 --> 00:30:53.580
What is this?

00:30:54.180 --> 00:30:55.020
This is called

00:30:56.700 --> 00:30:58.100
ice skin mooncake.

00:30:59.060 --> 00:30:59.900
Correct.

00:31:00.140 --> 00:31:01.360
I remember everything you said.

00:31:01.780 --> 00:31:02.660
In your place,

00:31:03.220 --> 00:31:04.700
mooncakes, cucumbers,

00:31:05.380 --> 00:31:06.700
and eggplants

00:31:06.700 --> 00:31:08.460
have different names.

00:31:08.700 --> 00:31:09.820
Father is called Dad.

00:31:10.060 --> 00:31:11.220
Mother is called Mom.

00:31:11.780 --> 00:31:13.180
Gongcai is your brother.

00:31:14.300 --> 00:31:15.340
What do you call me?

00:31:16.700 --> 00:31:17.540
Well.

00:31:19.620 --> 00:31:20.460
Sweetie.

00:31:22.220 --> 00:31:23.140
When you said that,

00:31:23.140 --> 00:31:24.660
you sounded like someone from our era.

00:31:30.260 --> 00:31:31.340
Thanks for your work.

00:31:31.480 --> 00:31:33.100
Mom and Dad just got back from Jiangnan.

00:31:33.100 --> 00:31:34.780
I wanted them to rest.

00:31:35.220 --> 00:31:37.060
Gongcai is busy with the branch.

00:31:37.580 --> 00:31:39.140
Yang Yang is preparing for exams.

00:31:39.140 --> 00:31:41.140
Yu San and Deyuan are too tired
during the day.

00:31:41.980 --> 00:31:44.180
I had no choice but to trouble you.

00:31:44.620 --> 00:31:45.580
The Mid-Autumn banquet

00:31:45.580 --> 00:31:47.460
is a gathering for our friends
and relatives.

00:31:48.180 --> 00:31:49.140
It is only natural

00:31:49.140 --> 00:31:50.260
for me to contribute.

00:32:00.980 --> 00:32:01.920
The apron came undone.

00:32:22.540 --> 00:32:23.860
Last year, on the Qixi Festival,

00:32:24.140 --> 00:32:26.060
when you helped me make flower cakes

00:32:26.300 --> 00:32:27.480
and I tied the apron for you,

00:32:27.480 --> 00:32:28.960
your ears turned red.

00:32:29.980 --> 00:32:30.940
Could it be that

00:32:30.940 --> 00:32:32.780
you had lustful thoughts for me then?

00:32:33.700 --> 00:32:34.540
Me?

00:32:35.220 --> 00:32:36.060
Lustful thoughts?

00:32:36.500 --> 00:32:37.540
That was too early.

00:32:40.820 --> 00:32:41.700
No, no.

00:32:41.700 --> 00:32:43.260
Don't you dare say it again.

00:32:43.700 --> 00:32:45.140
It's not lust.

00:32:45.500 --> 00:32:46.460
Then what is it?

00:32:46.940 --> 00:32:47.780
It's

00:32:48.780 --> 00:32:49.620
sincerity.

00:32:56.280 --> 00:32:57.340
How cheesy.

00:32:58.300 --> 00:32:59.260
What do you mean?

00:32:59.580 --> 00:33:00.590
It's a compliment.

00:33:04.740 --> 00:33:06.060
From your expression,

00:33:06.540 --> 00:33:07.480
it doesn't seem like it.

00:34:24.540 --> 00:34:27.140
(Shen's Diner)

00:34:27.180 --> 00:34:28.340
Pour the wine.

00:34:28.500 --> 00:34:29.240
Come on.

00:34:29.240 --> 00:34:30.340
Don't be a sore loser.

00:34:30.440 --> 00:34:31.380
Don't be a sore loser.

00:34:32.860 --> 00:34:34.460
- Here.
- This is tasty.

00:34:34.460 --> 00:34:36.040
- Two little bees.
- I'll get you this.

00:34:36.180 --> 00:34:37.380
Flying into the flower garden.

00:34:37.660 --> 00:34:38.540
Flying.

00:34:39.820 --> 00:34:40.660
I'll drink.

00:34:41.140 --> 00:34:42.080
Have you learned it yet?

00:34:42.620 --> 00:34:43.860
I don't believe it.

00:34:44.020 --> 00:34:44.860
One more time.

00:34:44.860 --> 00:34:45.780
- Again.
- Again.

00:34:48.100 --> 00:34:49.060
Come on, try one.

00:34:51.820 --> 00:34:52.660
Delicious, right?

00:34:52.660 --> 00:34:53.660
Yes.

00:34:53.660 --> 00:34:55.230
Did you have a good time in Jiangnan?

00:34:55.230 --> 00:34:56.080
I did.

00:34:56.080 --> 00:34:57.220
We'll go again next month.

00:34:57.220 --> 00:34:59.220
Gongcai and Jicai can watch the diner.

00:35:00.420 --> 00:35:02.300
You don't even feel sorry for the kids.

00:35:02.300 --> 00:35:03.620
They've all grown up.

00:35:04.120 --> 00:35:05.300
Where should we go next time?

00:35:05.300 --> 00:35:07.260
I knew you wanted to go.

00:35:07.460 --> 00:35:09.420
You're pretending not to.

00:35:12.340 --> 00:35:12.780
Liu Feng,

00:35:12.820 --> 00:35:14.300
you're celebrating the festival here.

00:35:14.300 --> 00:35:15.580
Won't your grandfather scold you?

00:35:16.100 --> 00:35:17.560
You're having a moon-viewing banquet.

00:35:17.560 --> 00:35:18.800
How could I miss the fun?

00:35:23.020 --> 00:35:23.960
Lady Jingwen, you made

00:35:23.960 --> 00:35:25.300
these vegetarian meatballs, right?

00:35:26.340 --> 00:35:27.180
They're so good.

00:35:28.140 --> 00:35:29.140
Hasn't your grandfather

00:35:29.140 --> 00:35:30.340
been urging you to get married?

00:35:30.420 --> 00:35:31.780
Mr. Liu, you flatter me.

00:35:31.900 --> 00:35:33.500
I've become the Yong'an Culinary Master.

00:35:33.500 --> 00:35:35.220
He won't force me anymore.

00:35:37.180 --> 00:35:38.700
The mooncakes are here.

00:35:40.340 --> 00:35:42.100
Each layer has a different flavor.

00:35:42.100 --> 00:35:43.380
Please choose for yourselves.

00:35:43.380 --> 00:35:44.220
Mooncakes.

00:35:44.540 --> 00:35:45.480
The mooncakes are here.

00:35:45.860 --> 00:35:46.780
My wife and I

00:35:46.780 --> 00:35:49.180
made all of them.

00:35:50.460 --> 00:35:52.140
Thank you, Mr. Cui.

00:35:54.340 --> 00:35:55.180
One for each person.

00:35:55.180 --> 00:35:56.220
Don't take more than one.

00:35:59.300 --> 00:36:00.460
Please sit down and eat.

00:36:21.340 --> 00:36:22.180
Deyuan.

00:36:27.620 --> 00:36:28.460
Someone's coming.

00:36:32.180 --> 00:36:33.020
Gentlemen.

00:36:34.300 --> 00:36:35.340
We've informed the Palace.

00:36:35.580 --> 00:36:36.780
We're having a lively gathering

00:36:37.100 --> 00:36:38.540
with our neighbors in Juxian Alley.

00:36:38.540 --> 00:36:39.660
We'll end before the Xu hour.

00:36:41.780 --> 00:36:43.020
Mr. Cui and Lady Shen prepared

00:36:43.020 --> 00:36:44.100
some mooncakes for you.

00:36:44.100 --> 00:36:44.940
Please accept them.

00:36:46.380 --> 00:36:47.220
Thank you, Mr. Cui.

00:36:47.540 --> 00:36:48.380
Thank you.

00:37:02.900 --> 00:37:03.740
Everyone.

00:37:08.380 --> 00:37:10.940
May you all always be as perfect

00:37:11.540 --> 00:37:13.540
and complete as this moon.

00:37:13.540 --> 00:37:15.100
Good.

00:38:08.420 --> 00:38:10.260
Dad, you made the Spring Water Lamb?

00:38:10.980 --> 00:38:12.100
Of course.

00:38:12.580 --> 00:38:13.900
For some reason,

00:38:13.900 --> 00:38:15.700
I suddenly wanted

00:38:15.700 --> 00:38:16.860
to make it again.

00:38:17.060 --> 00:38:18.700
It's absolutely delicious.

00:38:18.700 --> 00:38:20.060
You must all try it.

00:38:20.060 --> 00:38:21.700
My skills have definitely improved.

00:38:21.700 --> 00:38:23.740
Sweetheart, try it.

00:38:25.260 --> 00:38:26.300
Father.

00:38:26.300 --> 00:38:27.540
What does that mean?

00:38:27.830 --> 00:38:28.700
Don't call me that

00:38:28.700 --> 00:38:29.740
in front of the children.

00:38:29.740 --> 00:38:30.580
It's okay.

00:38:30.940 --> 00:38:32.460
- Try some.
- Let them try.

00:38:32.460 --> 00:38:33.820
Everyone, please try.

00:38:33.820 --> 00:38:34.780
San, eat.

00:38:34.780 --> 00:38:35.700
Here I go.

00:38:35.700 --> 00:38:36.540
I'll try.

00:38:39.420 --> 00:38:40.380
Come on, everyone.

00:38:40.660 --> 00:38:41.500
Come on.

00:38:42.760 --> 00:38:43.960
- This is delicious.
- Sure.

00:38:44.000 --> 00:38:44.960
Won't you have a piece?

00:38:44.960 --> 00:38:46.080
I've had several pieces.

00:38:53.620 --> 00:38:54.540
Delicious.

00:38:54.540 --> 00:38:55.620
See? Tasty, right?

Make way.

00:39:10.420 --> 00:39:11.460
Put out the fire.

00:39:11.460 --> 00:39:12.380
Put out the fire!

00:39:12.660 --> 00:39:13.620
Fire!

00:39:14.020 --> 00:39:16.140
Fire!

Fire!

Fire!

00:39:22.380 --> 00:39:23.540
Fire!
