WEBVTT

00:00:03.203 --> 00:00:05.071
Six Years Ago

00:00:05.171 --> 00:00:11.044
The Takami Family

00:00:21.287 --> 00:00:23.056
Can you please leave?

00:00:27.460 --> 00:00:32.732
I sincerely apologize.

00:00:34.934 --> 00:00:36.469
It's all your fault.

00:00:40.373 --> 00:00:41.674
Please leave.

00:00:42.876 --> 00:00:44.277
Please leave!

00:00:44.577 --> 00:00:46.246
– Stop! Calm down.
– Please go!

00:00:46.346 --> 00:00:47.814
Please go!

00:00:49.249 --> 00:00:50.283
Let's go.

00:00:56.322 --> 00:00:57.824
Why did you come?

00:01:00.226 --> 00:01:02.295
Takami worked directly under me.

00:01:04.064 --> 00:01:06.032
You must understand
how his parents feel, right?

00:01:11.404 --> 00:01:14.474
I'm the one who killed Takami.

00:01:28.488 --> 00:01:29.689
You know...

00:01:31.491 --> 00:01:33.760
That regret will probably
last for the rest of your life.

00:01:35.528 --> 00:01:38.398
It's easy to say
it wasn't your fault.

00:01:39.866 --> 00:01:42.035
But hearing that just
makes it harder for you, doesn't it?

00:01:46.406 --> 00:01:47.941
From here on out

00:01:49.843 --> 00:01:52.545
it's going to be
more painful than you think.

00:01:58.384 --> 00:01:59.686
I'll be here for you.

00:02:01.521 --> 00:02:02.589
So live.

00:02:11.064 --> 00:02:12.065
What?

00:02:14.667 --> 00:02:16.503
Were we that close?

00:02:17.804 --> 00:02:19.806
Idiot. We'll be
that close from now on.

00:02:20.206 --> 00:02:21.474
What the hell is that?

00:02:31.985 --> 00:02:34.154
It's all our responsibility.

00:02:38.525 --> 00:02:41.528
There are people who
end their own lives.

00:02:43.196 --> 00:02:45.465
And there are those
who drive them to it.

00:02:52.372 --> 00:02:56.509
I think that's the responsibility
of the education administration.

00:03:00.813 --> 00:03:03.516
Offering incense and
calling it a closure is meaningless.

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:09.822
There's no point
if it's just a fight for revenge.

00:03:21.868 --> 00:03:27.840
It's a fight for the survival
of Japan's education.

00:03:30.076 --> 00:03:31.177
Right?

00:03:38.718 --> 00:03:44.624
MR. MIKAMI'S CLASSROOM

00:03:45.725 --> 00:03:48.094
You're absolutely right.

00:03:48.194 --> 00:03:51.030
But at the time,
that was really tough for me.

00:03:51.164 --> 00:03:52.599
I get it.

00:03:52.699 --> 00:03:55.101
Oh? You understand?

00:03:55.201 --> 00:03:58.705
Attacking a fragile person
with righteous logic from above.

00:03:58.805 --> 00:04:00.106
That's Okami's signature move.

00:04:00.206 --> 00:04:02.141
That's so mean.

00:04:04.577 --> 00:04:06.846
But I was saved.

00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:10.917
If it weren't for Mikami,
I wouldn't be here now.

00:04:13.119 --> 00:04:17.290
So with that as the backdrop,
Mikami is sent out to the field

00:04:17.357 --> 00:04:19.325
while I remained in
the Ministry of Education.

00:04:19.692 --> 00:04:22.328
We decided to
gather evidence in our own ways.

00:04:40.780 --> 00:04:44.684
Here is an assignment
from Yamato Takeru.

00:04:46.786 --> 00:04:48.988
Bugging devices nowadays
sure are impressive.

00:04:49.188 --> 00:04:51.324
They can record
continuously for 200 hours.

00:04:52.859 --> 00:04:56.796
Anyway, I got a call from
ex-Chief Cabinet Secretary Azuma.

00:04:56.896 --> 00:04:58.731
It doesn't sound like good news.

00:04:59.198 --> 00:05:02.001
"My granddaughter refuses to
go to any school except Rintoku.

00:05:02.201 --> 00:05:05.638
Make a backdoor entry happen."
That's the message.

00:05:06.572 --> 00:05:09.375
Isn't this decisive evidence?

00:05:09.475 --> 00:05:11.210
But wiretapping is a little...

00:05:11.544 --> 00:05:14.280
This person is surprisingly cautious.

00:05:14.380 --> 00:05:17.550
He only holds secret meetings
at the same bar, in the same seat.

00:05:17.650 --> 00:05:19.319
Makino, you're getting carried away
and talking too much.

00:05:19.419 --> 00:05:21.521
Well, of course
I'm getting carried away.

00:05:21.621 --> 00:05:25.425
Mikami here was legendary
at the Ministry of Education

00:05:25.525 --> 00:05:27.093
as being completely unapproachable.

00:05:27.193 --> 00:05:30.496
I've been wondering
what kind of people could manage to

00:05:30.596 --> 00:05:32.832
get that close to him
in such a short time.

00:05:32.932 --> 00:05:35.802
Mr. Makino, do I detect
a hint of jealousy?

00:05:35.902 --> 00:05:37.170
Can you tell?

00:05:37.804 --> 00:05:40.873
If we combine Makino's data
with the data we gathered

00:05:41.507 --> 00:05:44.010
we can finally expose the full scope
of Rintoku's corruption.

00:05:44.277 --> 00:05:47.347
Give me a day,
and I can compile the data.

00:05:48.114 --> 00:05:51.317
– I'm counting on you, Jigen.
– Leave it to me.

00:05:53.886 --> 00:05:54.887
About this case...

00:05:57.290 --> 00:05:59.959
Would you let me handle it for now?

00:06:00.560 --> 00:06:01.861
Are you going to
write an article about it?

00:06:02.862 --> 00:06:04.497
Before that,
there's something I have to do.

00:06:07.400 --> 00:06:09.736
There are still current students
on this list, aside from Chigira.

00:06:10.436 --> 00:06:13.005
That's why Ms. Saejima couldn't act.

00:06:13.373 --> 00:06:15.942
Using students like this...

00:06:16.142 --> 00:06:17.210
It's unforgivable.

00:06:21.214 --> 00:06:22.648
I'll talk to Chigira.

00:06:25.651 --> 00:06:26.686
That's a good idea.

00:06:34.127 --> 00:06:35.862
It's been a while, hasn't it?

00:06:36.629 --> 00:06:39.499
Deceiving the enemy
starts with deceiving your own side.

00:06:39.599 --> 00:06:42.769
Remember how we staged
that fight in front of Tsubuki?

00:06:43.035 --> 00:06:45.138
You got your position
by selling me out, didn't you?

00:06:45.338 --> 00:06:46.572
So I should congratulate you.

00:06:47.640 --> 00:06:49.442
The next time we see him,
we owe him an apology.

00:06:49.809 --> 00:06:51.644
He's going to be so pissed.

00:06:54.046 --> 00:06:56.783
– Still, it's impressive.
– What do you mean?

00:06:56.883 --> 00:06:58.384
I'm talking about your students.

00:06:58.651 --> 00:07:00.353
Is that what high school seniors
are like now?

00:07:00.486 --> 00:07:02.889
Honestly, I'm surprised too.

00:07:02.989 --> 00:07:04.290
Right?

00:07:04.991 --> 00:07:06.492
Especially her. Tominaga, was it?

00:07:06.559 --> 00:07:08.761
How many lives has she lived?

00:07:09.095 --> 00:07:10.463
This is her first life.

00:07:11.230 --> 00:07:15.034
She's living her one and only life
with more intensity than anyone.

00:07:19.806 --> 00:07:23.709
Jeez, seriously!
Only you get the good moments.

00:07:26.078 --> 00:07:30.817
Yeah, I did feel a bit bad
for you partway through.

00:07:34.353 --> 00:07:37.290
But the real battle starts now.

00:07:38.724 --> 00:07:41.794
What will Kanzaki do?

00:07:43.629 --> 00:07:48.901
I always tell Ms. Koreeda
to be patient and wait.

00:07:50.002 --> 00:07:52.939
But all I can think now is,
"What can I do to help?"

00:07:57.210 --> 00:08:00.480
Are your students
really that lovable?

00:08:02.381 --> 00:08:03.883
Let me tell you.

00:08:05.451 --> 00:08:07.019
They really are, actually.

00:08:09.489 --> 00:08:11.524
Now that's just annoying.

00:08:12.558 --> 00:08:13.960
It's cold.

00:08:18.397 --> 00:08:19.932
It's finally starting.

00:08:20.166 --> 00:08:23.769
The battle for the survival
of Japan's education.

00:08:24.237 --> 00:08:26.472
The goal isn't just to
expose corruption.

00:08:26.873 --> 00:08:29.809
If the educational system
doesn't change, it's meaningless.

00:08:30.042 --> 00:08:31.043
Yeah.

00:08:31.844 --> 00:08:35.648
We start with Plan Okami Three.

00:08:36.816 --> 00:08:38.885
What's that? Sounds interesting.

00:08:39.252 --> 00:08:40.620
Let's hear it.

00:08:42.255 --> 00:08:44.924
The person who confessed they might
have been illegitimately admitted

00:08:45.024 --> 00:08:46.826
was Chigira, wasn't it?

00:08:50.997 --> 00:08:55.635
I thought she'd be a lively kid,
but she was really withdrawn.

00:08:56.736 --> 00:09:01.607
But personalities can
change dramatically around age 15

00:09:01.707 --> 00:09:03.376
so I thought maybe that was it.

00:09:04.777 --> 00:09:08.114
But that wasn't it, was it?

00:09:10.650 --> 00:09:13.119
The adults changed her.

00:09:17.356 --> 00:09:22.528
I think Chigira worked really hard
after entering this school.

00:09:23.095 --> 00:09:25.765
She's now one of
the top students in the class.

00:09:26.098 --> 00:09:27.967
But even after working that hard

00:09:28.301 --> 00:09:31.003
she's suffering because
she can't accept herself.

00:09:31.637 --> 00:09:35.575
I'll never forget
Chigira's face at that moment.

00:09:44.684 --> 00:09:45.685
Chigira.

00:09:46.852 --> 00:09:47.853
What is it?

00:09:49.188 --> 00:09:51.190
Can I have a moment?

00:09:52.925 --> 00:09:53.926
Sure.

00:10:10.743 --> 00:10:14.914
I knew.

00:10:18.551 --> 00:10:21.587
I knew I got into Rintoku
through dishonest means.

00:10:25.224 --> 00:10:27.660
If you want to write an article,
then go right ahead.

00:10:29.261 --> 00:10:32.898
But if the truth comes out,
it might not just end with

00:10:33.766 --> 00:10:36.902
your father losing
his career as a politician.

00:10:37.703 --> 00:10:40.139
– So...
– You need my permission?

00:10:43.342 --> 00:10:46.445
I know what I'm doing
is really cruel.

00:10:48.347 --> 00:10:49.348
But...

00:10:51.784 --> 00:10:53.452
I want us to think about it together.

00:11:01.394 --> 00:11:02.528
Sorry. I can't.

00:11:26.285 --> 00:11:28.154
Did you talk to Kanzaki?

00:11:30.089 --> 00:11:31.657
You knew?

00:11:39.265 --> 00:11:42.802
If quitting school were enough
to fix this, I wouldn't hesitate.

00:11:46.038 --> 00:11:47.773
But I have a younger sister.

00:11:51.143 --> 00:11:52.278
And...

00:11:55.014 --> 00:12:00.453
Besides me, there must be other
students still enrolled, too, right?

00:12:03.622 --> 00:12:04.957
That's true.

00:12:08.194 --> 00:12:10.496
It's impossible to
just decide what to do.

00:12:16.135 --> 00:12:17.503
It's okay to run away.

00:12:21.907 --> 00:12:23.876
At least, that's what
I wish I could tell you.

00:12:25.478 --> 00:12:27.713
But you can't find
a place to run to, can you?

00:12:31.450 --> 00:12:32.785
It would ruin
my little sister's life...

00:12:37.256 --> 00:12:39.692
and everyone else's.

00:12:44.196 --> 00:12:45.197
I'm scared.

00:12:52.004 --> 00:12:53.305
I can't forgive this.

00:12:57.009 --> 00:13:00.913
Chigira, your life is
yours to choose.

00:13:03.282 --> 00:13:07.820
But the school took
that freedom away from you.

00:13:10.489 --> 00:13:17.296
And I bear responsibility too,
for not realizing it.

00:13:24.870 --> 00:13:26.572
Chigira.

00:13:28.908 --> 00:13:31.811
I know that there is no option
that will leave you with no regrets.

00:13:35.648 --> 00:13:40.686
But what's already happened
can't be changed.

00:13:41.854 --> 00:13:44.824
Only the time that's ahead of you
can make a difference.

00:13:50.729 --> 00:13:52.331
It's frustrating.

00:13:57.169 --> 00:13:58.904
But I don't want to give up.

00:14:01.407 --> 00:14:03.108
I won't give up either.

00:14:04.443 --> 00:14:06.078
It's the only thing I can do.

00:14:07.213 --> 00:14:10.416
Let's see it through,
together, until the end.

00:14:20.392 --> 00:14:22.862
So, this Nakaoka guy

00:14:22.928 --> 00:14:25.397
is the one they call
"the shadow fixer."

00:14:25.664 --> 00:14:28.100
He passed requests for
illegitimate admissions

00:14:28.234 --> 00:14:31.203
from Nagatacho to
Mr. Mizohata through Mr. Tsukada.

00:14:32.338 --> 00:14:35.241
In return, Rintoku received
not only donations

00:14:35.407 --> 00:14:39.912
from the illegitimate students,
but also massive subsidies.

00:14:40.779 --> 00:14:42.281
What do the bureaucrats
stand to gain?

00:14:42.715 --> 00:14:44.884
Mr. Tsukada should never have been

00:14:44.984 --> 00:14:46.919
promoted that high
in the first place.

00:14:47.219 --> 00:14:50.189
I heard the Cabinet Personnel Bureau
pushed his promotion through.

00:14:50.656 --> 00:14:52.191
I see.

00:14:52.691 --> 00:14:57.596
Rintoku's information was
compiled in Ms. Saejima's data.

00:14:58.530 --> 00:15:00.933
She was forced to help
coordinate the fraud

00:15:01.033 --> 00:15:03.068
after she tried to
protect Itsuki Tokura.

00:15:03.335 --> 00:15:05.337
Her colleague, Tsutsui,
caught on to what she was doing

00:15:05.404 --> 00:15:06.772
and made advances on her.

00:15:07.172 --> 00:15:09.842
And after it was exposed
through my newspaper article

00:15:09.975 --> 00:15:13.913
she was offered a transfer to
a cram school run by Rintoku.

00:15:14.013 --> 00:15:16.348
But she declined,
believing she couldn't continue

00:15:16.482 --> 00:15:18.083
being part of the corruption.

00:15:18.584 --> 00:15:20.419
I have something too.

00:15:20.486 --> 00:15:23.622
I got the cram school's ledgers
and some old photos from Tokui.

00:15:23.722 --> 00:15:26.558
He's the former external auditor
and tax accountant

00:15:26.659 --> 00:15:30.596
and had kept the records
just in case.

00:15:31.297 --> 00:15:34.099
It seems they've received donations

00:15:34.199 --> 00:15:35.935
from companies known for shady,
though not criminal, practices.

00:15:36.035 --> 00:15:37.236
Also...

00:15:41.140 --> 00:15:44.843
Chairman Kodai and Mr. Tsukada
appear to be longtime acquaintances.

00:15:44.944 --> 00:15:47.680
By the way, this is
Representative Chigira.

00:15:52.851 --> 00:15:53.919
Bravo.

00:15:54.453 --> 00:15:55.921
All the dots have been connected.

00:15:56.021 --> 00:15:57.222
Incredible.

00:15:59.124 --> 00:16:00.125
What's so funny?

00:16:00.459 --> 00:16:04.163
Come on, you just have
way too much final boss energy.

00:16:04.697 --> 00:16:07.566
Can't be helped.
I am Yamato Takeru, after all.

00:16:08.767 --> 00:16:09.969
Wait, what time is it?

00:16:10.102 --> 00:16:12.471
– It's 7 p.m.
– Shoot! I have to go home.

00:16:12.571 --> 00:16:14.106
Is it about Ryu?

00:16:14.206 --> 00:16:17.276
Yeah. I'm really glad we made up

00:16:17.376 --> 00:16:19.645
but now he gets seriously mad
if I don't get home by 8 p.m.

00:16:19.745 --> 00:16:21.146
Talk about demanding.

00:16:21.246 --> 00:16:23.582
– You're totally loving it, though.
– It's just me gushing.

00:16:23.682 --> 00:16:26.285
Anyway, I'm off. Later, Mr. Makino!

00:16:28.821 --> 00:16:29.855
Ta-dah!

00:16:29.955 --> 00:16:32.558
Mom sent some
late-night snacks with love.

00:16:32.658 --> 00:16:34.593
I told her not to. I'll gain weight.

00:16:34.727 --> 00:16:37.730
If that's how you feel,
maybe I'll take it then.

00:16:38.964 --> 00:16:41.100
– Want to split it?
– Really?

00:16:41.867 --> 00:16:46.071
Yay! Which one should I choose?

00:16:47.139 --> 00:16:50.075
– Let me take this one.
– Then I'll have this one.

00:16:50.209 --> 00:16:51.410
Thanks.

00:16:54.246 --> 00:16:55.347
It's good!

00:16:56.281 --> 00:16:57.783
It's delicious.

00:17:02.388 --> 00:17:04.757
– You're amazing, Sis.
– What?

00:17:04.857 --> 00:17:07.393
Solving problems like this?
That's so cool.

00:17:09.261 --> 00:17:11.196
Not at all. It's normal.

00:17:12.531 --> 00:17:14.333
I'm taking the entrance exams
next year.

00:17:14.433 --> 00:17:17.202
So I'll have you
teach me lots and lots

00:17:17.469 --> 00:17:19.605
because I'm definitely
going to Rintoku.

00:17:24.777 --> 00:17:25.811
Yeah.

00:17:29.581 --> 00:17:31.784
Sis, what's wrong?

00:17:31.884 --> 00:17:33.585
No, it's nothing.

00:17:34.720 --> 00:17:37.356
– But...
– Really, it's nothing.

00:17:38.323 --> 00:17:39.391
You've got food on your face.

00:17:41.894 --> 00:17:42.895
Yum!

00:17:44.897 --> 00:17:46.432
Think I can solve this one?

00:17:46.532 --> 00:17:48.133
She said she's fine with whatever
happens to her, but she's worried

00:17:48.233 --> 00:17:51.136
about her family and underclassmen
who also might be involved.

00:17:52.304 --> 00:17:54.106
Isn't there anything we can do?

00:17:55.107 --> 00:17:57.843
For example, if we strike
a secret deal with Chairman Kodai

00:17:57.943 --> 00:18:00.145
we can get a promise that
this won't happen again.

00:18:00.245 --> 00:18:02.748
We could just make it all go away.

00:18:03.015 --> 00:18:04.550
But even if we did that

00:18:04.650 --> 00:18:07.152
Chigira would still
have that hanging over her.

00:18:07.252 --> 00:18:08.353
True.

00:18:08.787 --> 00:18:12.858
And if we managed to figure this out,
someone else could too.

00:18:13.158 --> 00:18:14.193
Does that mean...

00:18:14.493 --> 00:18:17.729
Makino got some probing questions
from a journalist acquaintance

00:18:17.963 --> 00:18:20.466
about political connections
to Rintoku.

00:18:21.266 --> 00:18:24.436
That case with Mayama Yuzuru
drew too much attention.

00:18:24.636 --> 00:18:25.804
That's not good.

00:18:26.205 --> 00:18:29.875
It may not blow up right away
since we don't have hard evidence

00:18:30.409 --> 00:18:32.544
but it'll be too late
if an article were to come out.

00:18:32.978 --> 00:18:37.549
And that article will be
full of things that will hurt people.

00:18:37.649 --> 00:18:40.686
The media has no obligation
to coddle those individuals.

00:18:41.053 --> 00:18:42.421
That's just cruel.

00:18:43.589 --> 00:18:44.823
Let's think.

00:18:52.965 --> 00:18:56.835
Chigira Haruka

00:19:02.474 --> 00:19:05.911
Mr. Mizohata, you're free
for fourth period, right?

00:19:07.579 --> 00:19:08.847
Yes, and what of it?

00:19:09.781 --> 00:19:12.451
Mr. Mikami is giving
a special lesson.

00:19:14.353 --> 00:19:17.923
It's a class to face Chigira head-on.

00:19:34.773 --> 00:19:36.942
There's something I want to
think through with all of you today.

00:19:48.287 --> 00:19:52.224
This whole year, I've been teaching
about the power of thought.

00:19:52.791 --> 00:19:55.294
So what do you think
it really means to "think"?

00:19:58.564 --> 00:20:01.033
Isn't it logical reasoning?

00:20:13.345 --> 00:20:16.148
"I think this because of that."

00:20:17.382 --> 00:20:19.351
Being able to explain
your reasoning clearly is important.

00:20:19.451 --> 00:20:22.321
That's what you're expected to do
in essay exams.

00:20:22.688 --> 00:20:26.525
But, I think that's also the limit of

00:20:26.625 --> 00:20:28.360
the kind of thinking
you're taught for tests.

00:20:31.063 --> 00:20:33.131
"Is war a bad thing?"

00:20:33.532 --> 00:20:35.934
That's actually
a deceptively easy question.

00:20:37.302 --> 00:20:39.238
– Shiiba.
– Yes?

00:20:39.338 --> 00:20:40.872
What would you say?

00:20:41.940 --> 00:20:42.941
Well...

00:20:46.245 --> 00:20:51.250
War unjustly takes human lives.

00:20:51.350 --> 00:20:53.819
So, it's wrong and should not happen.

00:20:54.119 --> 00:20:55.120
Exactly.

00:20:55.520 --> 00:20:57.689
But, what if
we phrased the question like this?

00:21:06.865 --> 00:21:09.501
Is there such a thing as a just war?

00:21:10.369 --> 00:21:14.940
Most people would probably say
such wars don't exist.

00:21:15.807 --> 00:21:17.342
But, can you still say that

00:21:17.442 --> 00:21:19.745
after studying
the history of specific wars?

00:21:20.512 --> 00:21:23.548
Invasions, terrorism,
dictatorships...

00:21:24.216 --> 00:21:27.119
Do you think using force to
resist such acts are wrong?

00:21:33.025 --> 00:21:34.126
Think about it.

00:21:44.169 --> 00:21:47.839
If we consider that war is,
in principle, wrong...

00:21:47.939 --> 00:21:50.142
then maybe no war is truly just.

00:21:50.842 --> 00:21:53.078
But, there are cases where
armed conflict is unavoidable.

00:21:53.412 --> 00:21:54.946
We can't deny that.

00:21:55.047 --> 00:21:56.281
Right.

00:21:56.682 --> 00:21:59.418
But, doesn't that statement

00:21:59.518 --> 00:22:03.255
contradict the idea
that war is always wrong?

00:22:04.823 --> 00:22:09.561
And who decides
whether it is unavoidable?

00:22:17.102 --> 00:22:18.337
I don't know.

00:22:21.673 --> 00:22:27.346
But surely,
there are soldiers our age

00:22:28.380 --> 00:22:31.450
wishing someone would tell
them, "You're not wrong,"

00:22:32.484 --> 00:22:34.353
as they fight with guns in hand.

00:22:37.723 --> 00:22:42.060
That's why war has to end.

00:22:43.662 --> 00:22:45.364
I get that.

00:22:46.231 --> 00:22:48.734
But it's not that easy to
eliminate war.

00:22:49.267 --> 00:22:50.535
Do you know why?

00:22:53.238 --> 00:22:54.740
Only vaguely.

00:22:55.507 --> 00:22:57.809
When thinking about war

00:22:58.143 --> 00:23:01.813
I believe we must not avert our eyes
from a fundamental truth.

00:23:02.848 --> 00:23:06.651
That is, war happens between nations.

00:23:06.752 --> 00:23:10.489
In other words, it's a
policy decision made by governments.

00:23:10.589 --> 00:23:12.391
That's an undeniable fact.

00:23:16.128 --> 00:23:20.031
War is something
decided by politics.

00:23:21.133 --> 00:23:23.602
It's decided by the representatives
we elect through voting.

00:23:23.735 --> 00:23:27.072
Which means,
it's essentially our will.

00:23:27.839 --> 00:23:34.246
With your vote, you might
be able to stop a war.

00:23:35.447 --> 00:23:38.417
Of course, sometimes that vote
may amount to nothing.

00:23:38.884 --> 00:23:42.621
But it's certain that
love and peace won't stop war.

00:23:45.323 --> 00:23:47.058
This is just one example.

00:23:47.559 --> 00:23:50.295
The world is full of
complicated, difficult...

00:23:52.230 --> 00:23:55.801
and unanswerable questions.

00:23:56.768 --> 00:23:58.270
A vulture and a girl.

00:23:58.370 --> 00:24:00.472
Poverty and terrorism. Euthanasia.

00:24:01.306 --> 00:24:05.377
Thinking about those things
is extremely painful, isn't it?

00:24:07.479 --> 00:24:12.417
The ability to think
isn't just about finding answers.

00:24:13.618 --> 00:24:16.588
It's about
the strength to keep thinking

00:24:16.688 --> 00:24:19.257
even when no answer comes.

00:24:37.476 --> 00:24:38.477
Let's keep thinking.

00:25:02.434 --> 00:25:03.502
Run away.

00:25:19.851 --> 00:25:21.286
I have one, too.

00:25:24.122 --> 00:25:26.291
A question without an answer.

00:25:29.261 --> 00:25:30.262
That is...

00:25:31.796 --> 00:25:35.066
My father did something
he shouldn't have.

00:25:38.703 --> 00:25:41.139
And Kanzaki knows about it.

00:25:53.218 --> 00:25:54.719
Kanzaki, you know...

00:25:56.788 --> 00:25:58.423
I was happy.

00:26:01.226 --> 00:26:04.029
You didn't ignore
the fact that I'm here.

00:26:07.832 --> 00:26:09.334
But, Kanzaki...

00:26:10.769 --> 00:26:13.071
You're going to become
a journalist, right?

00:26:14.773 --> 00:26:18.910
If someone like me is
involved in a story...

00:26:21.313 --> 00:26:24.983
Can you choose not to report it?

00:26:36.394 --> 00:26:37.662
I don't think so.

00:26:42.300 --> 00:26:43.435
Right.

00:26:45.570 --> 00:26:47.606
Because if you did,
you wouldn't be a real journalist.

00:26:51.409 --> 00:26:52.410
But...

00:26:54.746 --> 00:26:59.918
I'll never forget that you exist.

00:27:11.329 --> 00:27:12.597
It hurts.

00:27:18.269 --> 00:27:20.839
Even in this moment,
just talking about it...

00:27:24.809 --> 00:27:27.445
I'm overwhelmed with guilt,
like I'm betraying my own family.

00:27:28.813 --> 00:27:30.582
I just want to disappear.

00:27:34.919 --> 00:27:36.187
It's so painful...

00:27:44.496 --> 00:27:45.864
I can't breathe.

00:28:10.255 --> 00:28:11.256
But...

00:28:19.597 --> 00:28:23.868
If this truth were buried
to protect me

00:28:27.372 --> 00:28:29.541
I know I'd feel just as awful.

00:28:32.877 --> 00:28:34.479
There is no escape.

00:28:36.147 --> 00:28:41.786
So, the only choice is to
not run from it.

00:28:45.123 --> 00:28:46.391
Right?

00:28:53.765 --> 00:28:55.166
Thank you.

00:29:02.707 --> 00:29:04.042
So Kanzaki...

00:29:07.479 --> 00:29:09.748
Do what I can't.

00:29:13.518 --> 00:29:16.387
Think only about
what journalism should be.

00:29:20.692 --> 00:29:21.693
Got it.

00:29:24.329 --> 00:29:25.497
I promise I will.

00:29:53.658 --> 00:29:56.895
Regarding what Chigira just said...

00:30:02.000 --> 00:30:03.802
I am involved too.

00:30:22.520 --> 00:30:25.857
I had no idea that all of you

00:30:26.791 --> 00:30:31.863
were fighting this hard
in this classroom.

00:30:35.366 --> 00:30:38.770
I couldn't bear the thought of
some bureaucrat-turned-teacher

00:30:38.870 --> 00:30:42.674
achieving something I hadn't,
even after decades of teaching.

00:30:43.942 --> 00:30:45.910
I was obsessed with
dragging him down.

00:31:01.292 --> 00:31:06.297
But after seeing today's lesson

00:31:08.566 --> 00:31:13.938
I've realized the only thing I lacked
was the faith to believe in you all.

00:31:19.911 --> 00:31:21.479
At this point, all I can do is

00:31:23.781 --> 00:31:30.755
serve as a cautionary example
of what not to become.

00:31:34.325 --> 00:31:35.493
I'm sorry.

00:32:09.127 --> 00:32:14.699
The truth that Chigira and
Mr. Mizohata felt they had to

00:32:15.166 --> 00:32:20.638
throw away their own lives
just to bring to light is right here.

00:32:25.877 --> 00:32:27.612
I believe I have the duty
to protect this

00:32:27.679 --> 00:32:29.080
and deliver it to the world.

00:32:31.316 --> 00:32:34.686
Anyone who doesn't want
to be involved can leave now.

00:32:37.522 --> 00:32:40.625
There's no reason for you
to be dragged into this.

00:32:43.628 --> 00:32:48.066
For those who remain,
let's protect this together.

00:33:18.096 --> 00:33:20.298
– Mr. Mizobata.
– It's "Mizohata."

00:33:20.798 --> 00:33:24.035
We need those subsidies

00:33:24.369 --> 00:33:28.439
in order to take this school
from elite to ultra-elite status.

00:33:28.673 --> 00:33:29.674
I understand.

00:33:29.774 --> 00:33:32.910
That's why I'm doing all this.

00:33:33.144 --> 00:33:35.580
– Do you really understand?
– Yes.

00:33:35.680 --> 00:33:39.183
Then contact Mr. Nakaoka
immediately and take action.

00:33:39.984 --> 00:33:41.119
Understood.

00:33:41.419 --> 00:33:42.820
Please make it happen.

00:33:47.025 --> 00:33:48.493
Kanzaki.

00:33:48.593 --> 00:33:49.627
I think it's good.

00:33:49.694 --> 00:33:50.695
Good work, everyone.

00:33:50.795 --> 00:33:51.796
Thanks.

00:34:07.478 --> 00:34:08.579
Dad.

00:34:09.547 --> 00:34:10.548
Look at this.

00:34:18.222 --> 00:34:19.223
What's this?

00:34:19.290 --> 00:34:21.125
Illegal Placement Brokering in
Rintoku Academy

00:34:21.192 --> 00:34:24.629
I was wondering if
your newspaper could run it.

00:34:26.030 --> 00:34:29.567
Impossible. It lacks credibility.

00:34:30.501 --> 00:34:33.271
Photos, audio data, witnesses...

00:34:33.337 --> 00:34:34.572
All of it is there.

00:34:37.308 --> 00:34:42.313
If you won't publish it,
I'll take it to another paper.

00:34:46.317 --> 00:34:49.253
Is this true?

00:34:51.022 --> 00:34:54.592
Within that data
is one of my classmates.

00:34:56.327 --> 00:35:00.231
I felt so sick with self-loathing
writing that article.

00:35:05.002 --> 00:35:08.940
But Chigira said...

00:35:12.076 --> 00:35:14.645
"Just focus on
what journalism is all about."

00:35:18.182 --> 00:35:23.054
So I hope you can
think only about that, too.

00:35:32.563 --> 00:35:33.631
Mayama.

00:35:34.699 --> 00:35:35.867
You have a visitor.

00:35:49.280 --> 00:35:50.348
Listen.

00:35:53.251 --> 00:35:54.252
Yeah?

00:35:55.820 --> 00:36:02.260
I wanted to
put it into words properly.

00:36:08.533 --> 00:36:12.570
I also wrote down the things
I need to tell you.

00:36:12.670 --> 00:36:14.005
I don't want to miss anything.

00:36:18.042 --> 00:36:25.049
First, I'll respect
your decision regarding visitation.

00:36:28.452 --> 00:36:33.658
Second, I want
your permission to attend all trials

00:36:33.791 --> 00:36:37.795
and allow me to
take the stand if needed.

00:36:40.898 --> 00:36:46.704
Third, until you've finished
your atonement

00:36:47.972 --> 00:36:53.411
I will live a healthy life
no matter what happens.

00:36:57.281 --> 00:36:58.583
Mom...

00:37:00.117 --> 00:37:03.754
I want to live and see you again.

00:37:09.026 --> 00:37:12.063
So you need to live, too, Yuzuru.

00:37:13.164 --> 00:37:15.766
I want you to atone in
every sense of the word.

00:37:18.436 --> 00:37:24.275
I want you to truly understand
what it means to take a life.

00:37:27.345 --> 00:37:31.115
No matter how much
you writhe and suffer

00:37:33.284 --> 00:37:36.220
I want you to understand that
some things can never be undone.

00:38:12.390 --> 00:38:13.991
I'll do that too.

00:38:16.127 --> 00:38:17.395
No matter where I am.

00:38:23.401 --> 00:38:24.635
Mom...

00:38:26.604 --> 00:38:27.605
What is it?

00:38:30.741 --> 00:38:31.942
I...

00:38:36.847 --> 00:38:38.616
I killed someone.

00:38:41.285 --> 00:38:42.286
I know.

00:38:43.587 --> 00:38:45.489
I killed someone.

00:38:52.163 --> 00:38:53.164
I know.

00:38:53.798 --> 00:38:55.966
I really killed someone.

00:39:05.343 --> 00:39:06.644
Mom...

00:39:15.119 --> 00:39:18.489
One Week Later

00:39:19.590 --> 00:39:21.992
As I mentioned before

00:39:22.059 --> 00:39:25.096
we've decided to ask Mr. Mikami
to take over the position.

00:39:25.863 --> 00:39:27.832
Mikami has also promised
to continue supporting us

00:39:27.932 --> 00:39:30.434
even after returning to
the Ministry of Education.

00:39:31.302 --> 00:39:34.105
We still need him here
for at least another two years.

00:39:34.205 --> 00:39:35.339
I look forward to working with you.

00:39:35.439 --> 00:39:37.341
Likewise.

00:39:39.276 --> 00:39:43.280
So, Mikami, please explain
that matter to Mr. Nakaoka.

00:39:44.582 --> 00:39:48.986
Representative Azuma still refuses to
back down on the illicit admission?

00:39:49.286 --> 00:39:50.955
He is quite prideful.

00:39:51.355 --> 00:39:54.792
Yet he holds immense sway
over budget allocations.

00:39:54.892 --> 00:39:56.560
If he interferes with
the subsidy review

00:39:56.660 --> 00:39:58.729
both the national and prefectural
governments will be forced to comply.

00:39:58.963 --> 00:40:00.464
It would be disastrous.

00:40:00.598 --> 00:40:03.501
Still, based on the next fiscal year

00:40:03.567 --> 00:40:06.604
I believe the risks are too great
for both the Ministry and Rintoku.

00:40:06.771 --> 00:40:08.239
What?

00:40:08.305 --> 00:40:11.642
Mr. Tsukada,
this is not what we discussed.

00:40:12.309 --> 00:40:13.577
Now, now.

00:40:13.878 --> 00:40:15.379
Can you at least hear him out?

00:40:18.849 --> 00:40:21.886
Remember last year's
political fundraiser scandal?

00:40:21.986 --> 00:40:24.722
Ex-Chief Cabinet Secretary Azuma
wasn't even mentioned

00:40:24.822 --> 00:40:26.690
as one of the involved parties.

00:40:27.024 --> 00:40:29.560
But actually

00:40:29.627 --> 00:40:32.797
I'm close with one of the
Diet members in the Azuma faction.

00:40:33.164 --> 00:40:35.366
When I nudged him a bit,
he grumbled that

00:40:35.466 --> 00:40:38.502
he was under extreme pressure
to meet a strict quota.

00:40:41.739 --> 00:40:44.041
This is his note.

00:40:45.509 --> 00:40:47.478
If a significant amount
didn't go into Azuma's pocket

00:40:47.611 --> 00:40:49.280
it wouldn't make sense, right?

00:40:50.981 --> 00:40:53.851
Are you telling me to
threaten him with this?

00:40:54.618 --> 00:40:55.619
Is that not acceptable?

00:40:55.753 --> 00:40:57.721
My work is based on trust.

00:40:58.022 --> 00:40:59.990
It is absolutely unacceptable.

00:41:00.090 --> 00:41:02.126
Shall I step in and handle it?

00:41:02.226 --> 00:41:04.195
It won't change anything if you do.

00:41:04.528 --> 00:41:07.364
Rintoku equals me.

00:41:07.698 --> 00:41:09.934
But there's no other way.

00:41:11.168 --> 00:41:12.169
What's this?

00:41:14.138 --> 00:41:18.542
Are you saying this is the
collective will of all three of you?

00:41:20.511 --> 00:41:23.214
Well, from my standpoint...

00:41:23.647 --> 00:41:25.983
I can't allow Mr. Kodai,
my dear friend

00:41:26.050 --> 00:41:28.819
to walk such a dangerous path.

00:41:28.919 --> 00:41:34.692
If my reputation in Nagatacho drops,
neither of you will leave unscathed.

00:41:35.226 --> 00:41:38.929
I've asked you many times
to find another way.

00:41:39.630 --> 00:41:42.833
You've got a lot of nerve saying that
after I've indulged in you so much.

00:41:43.400 --> 00:41:44.735
Indulge?

00:41:45.603 --> 00:41:48.038
What exactly do you mean by that?

00:41:49.974 --> 00:41:53.978
I have not spent a single yen
for personal gain.

00:41:54.879 --> 00:41:57.815
Every single yen was used for
the sake of educational ideals.

00:41:57.915 --> 00:42:00.184
That's how Rintoku became
the top school in the prefecture

00:42:00.284 --> 00:42:01.519
in just 20 years.

00:42:05.523 --> 00:42:07.491
I'm sick of it.

00:42:08.459 --> 00:42:10.494
I'm sick of seeing the face of
someone like you

00:42:10.594 --> 00:42:12.530
who has no ideals about education.

00:42:12.930 --> 00:42:13.998
Excuse me?

00:42:16.934 --> 00:42:19.303
Give me a break with those jokes!

00:42:24.775 --> 00:42:26.744
Sorry, it's a bit loud in here.

00:42:26.844 --> 00:42:27.845
What?

00:42:27.912 --> 00:42:30.915
Mikami, I thought
we reserved the entire annex?

00:42:31.015 --> 00:42:33.284
Yes, that should be the case.
I'm sorry.

00:42:33.617 --> 00:42:34.618
What's going on?

00:42:47.631 --> 00:42:48.866
Makino...

00:42:50.801 --> 00:42:52.069
Long time no see.

00:42:53.070 --> 00:42:55.272
I was wondering
why I hadn't been invited lately.

00:42:55.372 --> 00:42:57.141
Looks like you've chosen Mikami.

00:42:57.241 --> 00:42:58.342
I'm hurt.

00:42:59.577 --> 00:43:00.811
What is going on?

00:43:03.047 --> 00:43:05.349
You were all in on this together?

00:43:10.621 --> 00:43:13.791
Mr. Mikami, explain yourself.

00:43:13.891 --> 00:43:15.926
I'm sure you can figure it out.

00:43:16.894 --> 00:43:20.164
An article will be published in
the Toto Newspaper tomorrow.

00:43:21.599 --> 00:43:23.033
What's this about?

00:43:23.801 --> 00:43:26.337
It states how the corrupt
relationship between

00:43:26.437 --> 00:43:31.141
Nagatacho, Kasumigaseki, and Rintoku
was cultivated by a shadow fixer...

00:43:31.442 --> 00:43:34.278
and how it led to the stabbing
of one innocent young man.

00:43:34.378 --> 00:43:37.548
It's the story of a butterfly effect
no one could have seen coming.

00:43:38.882 --> 00:43:41.652
Kanzaki wrote it and
entrusted it to his father.

00:43:42.219 --> 00:43:43.520
It's autonomy in action.

00:43:45.122 --> 00:43:47.191
You'll get to witness

00:43:47.257 --> 00:43:50.394
the moment your education
bore a truly outstanding result.

00:43:53.263 --> 00:43:55.132
– Since when?
– From the very beginning.

00:43:55.666 --> 00:43:57.668
I came to Rintoku
for this very purpose.

00:43:59.670 --> 00:44:01.005
Stop the article!

00:44:02.072 --> 00:44:03.073
I can't do that.

00:44:04.475 --> 00:44:05.476
What did you say?

00:44:05.576 --> 00:44:09.380
My students thought hard

00:44:10.147 --> 00:44:13.717
came to this conclusion
after their struggles.

00:44:15.085 --> 00:44:17.354
Chigira herself, who was admitted
under fraudulent means

00:44:17.454 --> 00:44:18.922
asked us to publish it.

00:44:20.024 --> 00:44:23.093
Kanzaki answered that request while
barely holding himself together.

00:44:24.862 --> 00:44:28.666
There's no way we could
choose to kill the story.

00:44:30.034 --> 00:44:31.368
Don't you agree?

00:44:32.670 --> 00:44:37.641
It's because bureaucrats like you
can't create a proper education

00:44:37.741 --> 00:44:41.512
that I've had to swallow this filth
and do it myself!

00:44:43.380 --> 00:44:45.215
Even if we just provide
a normal education...

00:44:46.917 --> 00:44:48.185
Even if it's a good education

00:44:48.285 --> 00:44:50.954
the students still won't
be accepted once they enter society.

00:44:53.691 --> 00:44:55.059
It's a society that

00:44:55.159 --> 00:44:57.261
judges human worth solely
by the university you went to.

00:44:57.761 --> 00:45:00.497
You, the education authorities,
created that!

00:45:00.664 --> 00:45:02.433
You don't have to tell me.

00:45:02.533 --> 00:45:04.435
I'll spend the rest of my life
atoning for that.

00:45:04.535 --> 00:45:06.236
By changing education.

00:45:07.037 --> 00:45:09.673
Without me, Rintoku will fall apart,
as will its educational culture!

00:45:09.773 --> 00:45:11.008
Unfortunately for you

00:45:11.942 --> 00:45:15.245
schools don't collapse just
because the chairman changes.

00:45:18.382 --> 00:45:21.485
The ideals you built for Rintoku
are wonderful, Mr. Kodai.

00:45:22.186 --> 00:45:25.522
But do you really want to
protect those ideals

00:45:26.290 --> 00:45:28.926
at the cost of
harming the lives of the students?

00:45:30.527 --> 00:45:33.063
If so, you're no different
from this country's system.

00:45:33.831 --> 00:45:36.133
Is that the life
you intend to keep living?

00:45:40.471 --> 00:45:44.575
This is ridiculous. I'm leaving.

00:45:48.879 --> 00:45:50.748
This is Mr. Fujisaki from the
Metropolitan Police Department's

00:45:50.848 --> 00:45:52.116
Second Investigation Division.

00:45:53.717 --> 00:45:55.219
You bastards...

00:45:55.586 --> 00:45:56.587
You tricked me!

00:45:57.254 --> 00:46:01.558
Yes, Plan Okami Three
has been activated.

00:46:02.426 --> 00:46:03.761
What the hell is that?

00:46:04.294 --> 00:46:05.562
Don't mess with me!

00:46:05.996 --> 00:46:09.032
That's enough, Mr. Tsukada.

00:46:21.411 --> 00:46:22.446
Mr. Kodai.

00:46:25.983 --> 00:46:27.351
I promise you.

00:46:28.519 --> 00:46:30.954
I will protect
Rintoku Academy and its students.

00:46:51.608 --> 00:46:55.546
Funabashi Central Police Station

00:47:06.957 --> 00:47:10.527
Backdoor Admissions at
Rintoku Academy Exposed!

00:47:10.961 --> 00:47:12.796
Collusion with
the Ministry of Education

00:47:12.896 --> 00:47:16.867
Backdoor Admission List
Includes Child of a Politician

00:47:39.790 --> 00:47:42.693
We'll also begin a serialized article
in our group's magazine

00:47:42.793 --> 00:47:44.361
featuring your story.

00:47:46.163 --> 00:47:51.501
I wrote a letter to
Ms. Shibutani Kanako.

00:47:53.470 --> 00:47:54.571
I see.

00:47:59.776 --> 00:48:01.078
Kanzaki.

00:48:02.779 --> 00:48:03.780
What is it?

00:48:07.651 --> 00:48:09.019
About my mother...

00:48:13.090 --> 00:48:14.157
It's fine.

00:48:16.460 --> 00:48:19.596
I'll visit her as often as I can,
even if it annoys her.

00:48:22.266 --> 00:48:25.369
I hope you get a reply someday.

00:48:28.906 --> 00:48:34.311
It's wrong to wish for that.

00:48:37.447 --> 00:48:38.615
Even so...

00:48:43.487 --> 00:48:45.489
So there's no changing your mind?

00:48:45.989 --> 00:48:46.990
No.

00:48:49.526 --> 00:48:53.764
I just didn't want to
graduate from Rintoku.

00:48:56.199 --> 00:48:59.403
Shiiba, did you know about the
high school equivalency exam?

00:49:00.170 --> 00:49:04.207
I did. She's amazing, right?

00:49:04.341 --> 00:49:07.177
Truly amazing.

00:49:08.545 --> 00:49:13.083
I want to get into university
on my own.

00:49:14.952 --> 00:49:16.119
With everyone...

00:49:17.654 --> 00:49:18.789
With Shiiba...

00:49:21.291 --> 00:49:23.994
I want to start as
a freshman with a clear conscience.

00:49:25.462 --> 00:49:27.664
You can definitely do it, Chigira.

00:49:27.864 --> 00:49:28.999
Yeah.

00:49:29.066 --> 00:49:32.002
In fact, I have to work hard

00:49:32.102 --> 00:49:33.971
so I don't end up
as your lowerclassmen.

00:49:34.905 --> 00:49:37.808
Thank you for gathering today.

00:49:38.208 --> 00:49:41.378
We'll begin the press conference
when it's time.

00:49:41.778 --> 00:49:45.849
You told me my educational ideals
were wonderful.

00:49:47.217 --> 00:49:48.952
But to realize those ideals

00:49:49.052 --> 00:49:52.489
it's the country's system
that needs to change.

00:49:55.025 --> 00:49:57.260
Yet, I used the reality as an excuse.

00:49:57.828 --> 00:49:59.930
And before I knew it

00:50:00.030 --> 00:50:03.667
I myself had hopped onto
the rails of that very system.

00:50:05.202 --> 00:50:07.304
I've swallowed enough mud.

00:50:14.411 --> 00:50:15.879
Even so...

00:50:16.513 --> 00:50:18.315
What the reporters really want
is a story about

00:50:18.382 --> 00:50:23.387
a money-hungry villain
who turned education into a business.

00:50:24.454 --> 00:50:30.193
And stories like this are
sometimes used as scapegoats

00:50:30.293 --> 00:50:34.965
to cover up the inconvenient truths
a nation doesn't want exposed.

00:50:37.834 --> 00:50:41.471
Well, if that could actually upgrade
our country's education system

00:50:41.571 --> 00:50:44.408
I'd gladly be the sacrificial lamb.

00:50:45.308 --> 00:50:47.978
But unfortunately,
it's never that simple.

00:50:49.746 --> 00:50:50.981
I'll be forgotten

00:50:51.081 --> 00:50:54.851
and someone else will become
the next scapegoat.

00:50:56.386 --> 00:50:59.489
This country keeps repeating
the same ridiculous farce.

00:50:59.790 --> 00:51:03.427
However, the ideals of
Rintoku still live on

00:51:04.061 --> 00:51:06.229
in the students you nurtured.

00:51:17.507 --> 00:51:22.012
Society and education
aren't enemies to be defeated.

00:51:23.246 --> 00:51:27.751
They are fragile,
vulnerable things we must protect.

00:51:28.785 --> 00:51:33.190
All the more reason we need to
carefully cultivate them.

00:51:34.257 --> 00:51:37.627
Both people and institutions.

00:51:56.513 --> 00:52:01.585
I look forward to seeing
true education reform...

00:52:03.220 --> 00:52:04.488
Mr. Mikami.

00:52:31.148 --> 00:52:35.352
I'm Kodai Masahide,
Chairman of Rintoku Academy.

00:52:36.720 --> 00:52:41.758
March, Year 2025

00:53:19.162 --> 00:53:22.265
Thank you, Okami and Ms. Koreeda!

00:53:22.365 --> 00:53:29.172
Congratulations on Your Graduation!
Rintoku Class 3-2

00:53:36.880 --> 00:53:37.881
Hey.

00:53:37.948 --> 00:53:39.249
Congratulations on your graduation.

00:53:46.256 --> 00:53:50.193
There's something I want to ask you.

00:53:50.327 --> 00:53:51.428
What is it?

00:53:51.928 --> 00:53:56.266
Okami, you came to
save me, didn't you?

00:53:57.934 --> 00:53:59.569
I was curious, of course.

00:54:00.904 --> 00:54:01.905
What?

00:54:02.239 --> 00:54:04.574
Ms. Isshiki told me there was
a student who acted like my brother.

00:54:04.674 --> 00:54:08.812
And when I actually came and saw you,
you were really just like him.

00:54:08.878 --> 00:54:10.747
Honestly, I was really worried.

00:54:12.582 --> 00:54:15.018
Looking back on
what I was thinking last year

00:54:15.885 --> 00:54:17.520
I can only shake my head.

00:54:18.688 --> 00:54:19.856
Yeah.

00:54:21.358 --> 00:54:22.892
But now, my brother is my brother.

00:54:23.493 --> 00:54:26.062
And I only see you as you.

00:54:28.198 --> 00:54:33.003
Thinking deeply is
not being kind to yourself at all.

00:54:34.304 --> 00:54:35.338
But even so...

00:54:37.474 --> 00:54:39.809
I'll never let go of it.

00:54:42.746 --> 00:54:44.247
And one more thing.

00:54:44.381 --> 00:54:45.382
What is it?

00:54:47.550 --> 00:54:48.818
I...

00:54:50.487 --> 00:54:51.721
I won't die.

00:54:54.624 --> 00:54:55.825
No matter what happens.

00:55:00.563 --> 00:55:04.768
I'll hold you to your word.

00:55:11.675 --> 00:55:12.942
There you are, Okami!

00:55:25.955 --> 00:55:27.257
Congratulations on your graduation!

00:55:28.758 --> 00:55:29.926
It was fun.

00:55:31.328 --> 00:55:33.897
It was the most fun year of my life.

00:55:34.464 --> 00:55:37.534
That's not fair!
I was going to say that!

00:55:39.369 --> 00:55:41.037
That goes for all of us.

00:55:41.538 --> 00:55:43.440
Probably everyone, I think.

00:55:43.540 --> 00:55:44.908
I'm glad to hear that.

00:55:45.008 --> 00:55:46.142
Don't blush.

00:55:46.242 --> 00:55:47.410
Come on, how could I not?

00:55:49.012 --> 00:55:55.819
It was the toughest year of my life,
constantly having to deny myself.

00:55:58.121 --> 00:55:59.122
I know.

00:55:59.823 --> 00:56:03.326
But it was also a year
where I came to believe that

00:56:03.660 --> 00:56:07.330
people can change,
no matter how old they are.

00:56:08.031 --> 00:56:11.167
Exactly. I learned that too.

00:56:13.169 --> 00:56:15.939
Our precious students
are leaving this school now.

00:56:17.240 --> 00:56:20.176
And the teachers are
the only ones left behind.

00:56:24.214 --> 00:56:28.351
But that means we get to
be teachers again next year.

00:56:28.885 --> 00:56:29.886
Yes.

00:56:35.425 --> 00:56:36.459
This is making me blush.

00:56:37.627 --> 00:56:42.465
Thank you for such a wonderful year.

00:56:45.001 --> 00:56:46.169
Likewise.

00:56:47.971 --> 00:56:49.305
Thank you so much.

00:56:54.177 --> 00:56:59.749
Mr. Okami, can you please
give us a few final words?

00:57:00.049 --> 00:57:01.451
Come on. That's embarrassing.

00:57:01.985 --> 00:57:03.987
You think you can run from this?

00:57:05.455 --> 00:57:07.123
Please say something.

00:57:09.692 --> 00:57:10.827
Well...

00:57:57.774 --> 00:57:59.442
For the past year

00:58:00.109 --> 00:58:02.712
there's only one thing
I kept telling you all to do.

00:58:04.047 --> 00:58:07.650
"Think with your own head."

00:58:09.586 --> 00:58:13.356
Every time I told you to think,
I was thinking too.

00:58:15.391 --> 00:58:19.295
I kept thinking,
"I'm not sure I can do this."

00:58:20.597 --> 00:58:23.700
Even though you always looked like
you had all the answers?

00:58:23.800 --> 00:58:26.436
That's the one thing
we bureaucrats are good at.

00:58:29.372 --> 00:58:33.943
This year was way more
difficult than I ever imagined.

00:58:35.011 --> 00:58:39.716
But every time, you all came up
with solutions that defied belief.

00:58:41.484 --> 00:58:45.588
You might not even realize it
yourselves, but...

00:58:46.356 --> 00:58:48.258
For example, for Shinonome...

00:58:49.025 --> 00:58:50.527
For Shiiba...

00:58:51.427 --> 00:58:52.829
And for Chigira...

00:58:54.430 --> 00:58:56.833
Every single answer
you came up with for these questions

00:58:57.233 --> 00:59:01.504
pulled a huge national issue
into the light.

00:59:07.744 --> 00:59:14.050
You showed me that
such things were possible.

00:59:16.252 --> 00:59:20.557
"The personal is political."

00:59:22.025 --> 00:59:24.394
It was the perfect embodiment
of the phrase.

00:59:26.262 --> 00:59:29.332
But you know,
this is what I also think.

00:59:41.077 --> 00:59:43.713
A Question Without an Answer

00:59:43.780 --> 00:59:46.115
A solution based on an outcome
is a wonderful thing.

00:59:46.950 --> 00:59:50.687
But what's even more wonderful
is that within each of you

00:59:51.521 --> 00:59:54.757
there are countless questions without
clear answers that you're confronting

00:59:55.625 --> 00:59:57.627
with everything you've got.

00:59:59.562 --> 01:00:02.265
Those questions
may feel overwhelming at times

01:00:02.365 --> 01:00:04.067
and it'll make you want to give up.

01:00:04.167 --> 01:00:06.002
You may even face despair.

01:00:07.337 --> 01:00:12.108
But I hope you remember
one thing in those moments.

01:00:15.778 --> 01:00:17.580
That the questions are right here...

01:00:19.949 --> 01:00:22.485
inside your own minds.

01:00:24.587 --> 01:00:26.356
And that someone
was looking forward to

01:00:26.456 --> 01:00:27.690
seeing how you'd face them
more than anyone else.

01:00:29.726 --> 01:00:32.829
Because those
unanswered questions inside you

01:00:33.696 --> 01:00:35.298
are the future itself.

01:00:37.367 --> 01:00:42.405
And the answers you come up with
through your suffering

01:00:45.675 --> 01:00:47.910
will surely be ones
that stand with the weak.

01:01:08.197 --> 01:01:09.966
You guys can do it.

01:01:12.969 --> 01:01:14.637
I believe in you.

01:01:22.779 --> 01:01:24.280
Congratulations on your graduation.

01:02:14.097 --> 01:02:15.932
Why'd you come all the way here?

01:02:16.165 --> 01:02:18.000
I have two things to report.

01:02:18.201 --> 01:02:19.202
What?

01:02:19.302 --> 01:02:20.470
First,

01:02:20.536 --> 01:02:22.438
Tsubuki has decided to work hard
at the Ministry of Education

01:02:22.505 --> 01:02:23.873
for at least this year.

01:02:24.173 --> 01:02:25.408
Is that right?

01:02:26.342 --> 01:02:28.010
And second...

01:02:29.078 --> 01:02:33.082
I've decided to study for
a teaching license

01:02:33.182 --> 01:02:35.151
through a correspondence course.

01:02:35.618 --> 01:02:37.920
– What? Are you serious?
– Dead serious.

01:02:38.955 --> 01:02:40.890
I also somehow forced
the higher-ups to approve it.

01:02:40.990 --> 01:02:43.259
Come on, that's reckless.

01:02:43.793 --> 01:02:45.094
I guess it is.

01:02:46.028 --> 01:02:48.965
I mean, how will I even
manage the teaching internship?

01:02:49.799 --> 01:02:51.367
I'll just have to figure it out.

01:02:55.404 --> 01:02:58.141
We're both such education nerds.

01:03:00.076 --> 01:03:02.078
Because if that part doesn't change

01:03:04.080 --> 01:03:05.715
Japan won't change either.

01:03:08.184 --> 01:03:09.385
That's right.

01:03:17.860 --> 01:03:21.831
I only made it through this past year
thanks to you, Makino.

01:03:22.732 --> 01:03:23.733
No.

01:03:25.568 --> 01:03:27.370
It's thanks to your students.

01:03:37.280 --> 01:03:38.514
Yeah, you're right.

01:04:00.703 --> 01:04:06.042
It was a series of changes so small,
you could almost overlook them.

01:04:12.548 --> 01:04:14.784
– Tsubuki, can I have a moment?
– Yes.

01:04:15.618 --> 01:04:19.555
That place probably can't
change all at once, either.

01:04:21.591 --> 01:04:25.862
But alongside reckless challenges,
you were always there.

01:04:29.131 --> 01:04:30.166
Look. Birds.

01:04:30.266 --> 01:04:31.901
Yeah, I see it.

01:04:32.435 --> 01:04:34.237
There were probably
far too many things

01:04:34.537 --> 01:04:37.974
I couldn't have
accomplished without you.

01:04:46.148 --> 01:04:48.684
It's probably a common twist
in stories like this

01:04:49.218 --> 01:04:51.854
where you think you're the shield,
when you're the one being shielded.

01:05:04.400 --> 01:05:06.235
Court is now in session.

01:05:06.869 --> 01:05:08.671
Defendant, please stand
before the witness stand.

01:05:23.419 --> 01:05:27.490
In order to fully bear
the weight of your crime...

01:05:28.157 --> 01:05:30.192
you stand there now

01:05:30.293 --> 01:05:31.794
carrying the heart
you finally reclaimed.

01:05:50.246 --> 01:05:52.281
Once again,
I return to the same question.

01:05:53.349 --> 01:05:55.384
"What is education?"

01:06:48.437 --> 01:06:49.538
And so...

01:06:51.741 --> 01:06:53.042
I move forward.

01:07:17.733 --> 01:07:21.537
"The personal is political."
The personal is political.

01:07:21.637 --> 01:07:23.139
From now on,
I will never look away again.

01:07:23.239 --> 01:07:24.340
I promise.

01:07:25.875 --> 01:07:26.942
Let's keep thinking.
