00:01:13.571 --> 00:01:14.681
I tried to call you...

00:01:15.941 --> 00:01:17.681
a few times, but I...

00:01:20.481 --> 00:01:22.351
Luckily, the guy didn't die.

00:01:23.521 --> 00:01:24.991
- He didn't? - Didn't we agree...

00:01:24.991 --> 00:01:27.191
you'd just graze me?

00:01:27.961 --> 00:01:28.991
Yes.

00:01:31.536 --> 00:01:33.636
So why did you have to blow it up like that?

00:01:33.661 --> 00:01:37.301
Please spare me, sir. I...

00:01:37.331 --> 00:01:39.071
Please, I'm begging you. I'm so sorry.

00:01:45.441 --> 00:01:47.211
When you screw up like that,

00:01:48.141 --> 00:01:49.811
it really upsets me.

00:01:50.981 --> 00:01:52.951
You get that?

00:01:53.681 --> 00:01:57.381
I was wrong, sir. I'll do better.

00:01:57.451 --> 00:01:59.591
I'll do much better, sir.

00:01:59.951 --> 00:02:01.291

00:02:05.391 --> 00:02:08.401
Excuse me. Could you call 911?

00:02:08.561 --> 00:02:09.561
Wait.

00:02:12.101 --> 00:02:13.531
Open the door, you jerk!

00:02:13.631 --> 00:02:15.501
Tell me everything you remember about him.

00:02:16.971 --> 00:02:17.971
I...

00:02:18.711 --> 00:02:20.111

00:02:20.671 --> 00:02:21.711
I can't remember.

00:02:27.281 --> 00:02:28.421
Sir.

00:02:30.351 --> 00:02:31.821
Wait, I remember now.

00:02:32.491 --> 00:02:34.351
He said he was going to kill me.

00:02:34.791 --> 00:02:36.861
I don't know why,

00:02:37.491 --> 00:02:39.361
but he just kept saying he was going to kill me.

00:02:40.231 --> 00:02:42.801
I remember now, sir.

00:02:55.841 --> 00:02:57.851
An atonement...

00:02:58.211 --> 00:02:59.211

00:03:02.481 --> 00:03:03.921

00:03:24.641 --> 00:03:26.011
What took you so long?

00:03:26.911 --> 00:03:30.781
- How did you know I was here? - You sure keep yourself busy.

00:03:31.481 --> 00:03:34.751

00:03:35.051 --> 00:03:36.851

00:03:40.851 --> 00:03:41.891
to you, Mr. Shin.

00:03:43.491 --> 00:03:44.691
So?

00:03:47.091 --> 00:03:48.601
I want to help.

00:03:49.261 --> 00:03:50.261
Forget it.

00:03:53.301 --> 00:03:56.471
- We have to catch Yun Dong Hee. - I'll get him. My way.

00:03:57.471 --> 00:03:59.941
Right. Your way, Mr. Shin.

00:04:00.111 --> 00:04:01.781
Someone could die,

00:04:02.141 --> 00:04:03.741
or I might have to kill someone.

00:04:05.751 --> 00:04:08.081

00:04:38.351 --> 00:04:39.511
Because of Kim Yong Woo,

00:04:39.511 --> 00:04:42.321
you went through so much 15 years ago.

00:04:44.421 --> 00:04:48.521
This time, you must finish it right. That's the only way this all ends.

00:04:49.221 --> 00:04:50.221
Got it?

00:04:51.291 --> 00:04:52.291
Yes.

00:04:55.731 --> 00:04:57.971
We go way back, don't we?

00:04:58.471 --> 00:05:00.371
If I hadn't met you back then,

00:05:01.101 --> 00:05:03.271
I would've rotted in prison for life.

00:05:03.271 --> 00:05:05.071
Think of your late mother.

00:05:06.471 --> 00:05:07.941
Because of that jerk, Kim Yong Woo,

00:05:08.541 --> 00:05:10.581
she was stuck in the hospital for so long.

00:05:10.941 --> 00:05:12.081
That's not it.

00:05:12.151 --> 00:05:16.181
You cared for my mother till the end.

00:05:16.481 --> 00:05:18.621
And look at the life I have now.

00:05:19.351 --> 00:05:21.691
You more than deserve it.

00:05:28.361 --> 00:05:29.361
Here, take this.

00:05:30.701 --> 00:05:31.901
What is this?

00:05:32.301 --> 00:05:33.301
Open it.

00:05:36.541 --> 00:05:40.041
The sun's bright in Europe, so sunglasses are a must-have.

00:05:44.441 --> 00:05:46.781
- They look great on you. - Really?

00:05:47.881 --> 00:05:48.951
But sir.

00:05:49.421 --> 00:05:51.921
You didn't know the cops were coming either, did you?

00:05:57.561 --> 00:05:58.561
Of course.

00:05:59.331 --> 00:06:00.361
I didn't know either.

00:06:02.101 --> 00:06:05.331
I should've gone through with it.

00:06:05.971 --> 00:06:08.701
- I'm so sorry. - Everyone makes mistakes.

00:06:09.201 --> 00:06:11.411
Just don't make the same mistake again.

00:06:13.771 --> 00:06:14.781
Right.

00:07:20.241 --> 00:07:23.581
A detective was stabbed outside the Federal Med Center director's house.

00:07:23.811 --> 00:07:25.511
And Mr. Shin was right there when it happened.

00:07:25.711 --> 00:07:26.711
What?

00:07:26.711 --> 00:07:29.951
It could have been Mr. Shin who got stabbed.

00:07:31.421 --> 00:07:34.491
- I want to help too. - Someone could die,

00:07:35.061 --> 00:07:36.421
or you could end up killing someone.

00:07:38.691 --> 00:07:39.831
Why are you here?

00:07:41.391 --> 00:07:43.831
To go on deliveries with you. Let's go.

00:07:55.181 --> 00:07:56.511
This one here and that one up ahead, right?

00:07:56.741 --> 00:07:57.781
Yes.

00:08:14.061 --> 00:08:15.531
Are you sure you just came to do deliveries?

00:08:16.001 --> 00:08:17.001
Yes.

00:08:17.661 --> 00:08:19.331
Just making sure you're in good shape for your exams.

00:08:21.431 --> 00:08:22.641
That's not it.

00:08:23.071 --> 00:08:24.271
Something's bothering you, isn't it?

00:08:25.111 --> 00:08:27.541
Spit it out. Did you fight with Mr. Shin again?

00:08:30.111 --> 00:08:31.141
What do you mean, "again?"

00:08:31.281 --> 00:08:33.581
When have I ever fought with Mr. Shin?

00:08:33.681 --> 00:08:36.781
That's true. It's usually him giving you a hard time, isn't it?

00:08:40.421 --> 00:08:41.491
What's that supposed to mean?

00:08:42.861 --> 00:08:44.521
Seriously, did something happen with Mr. Shin?

00:08:46.361 --> 00:08:48.361
So don't act like you're in on this.

00:08:55.471 --> 00:08:57.471
I want to help him somehow,

00:08:57.941 --> 00:08:59.771
but I don't think Mr. Shin wants my help.

00:09:02.781 --> 00:09:03.881
And I thought it was something serious.

00:09:04.281 --> 00:09:06.851
It's too early for this nonsense.

00:09:08.751 --> 00:09:10.121
- What? - This second-guessing...

00:09:10.121 --> 00:09:11.821
and consideration.

00:09:12.551 --> 00:09:13.851
With all that, when are you ever going to help?

00:09:15.991 --> 00:09:17.261
Guess who said that?

00:09:20.731 --> 00:09:22.431
- Mr. Shin. - Exactly.

00:09:22.961 --> 00:09:25.901
If you want to help, you just help.

00:09:26.831 --> 00:09:30.871
I saw Mr. Shin sighing a lot lately, so I figured something was up.

00:09:35.011 --> 00:09:36.611
You're great and all,

00:09:37.041 --> 00:09:38.381
but you think too much.

00:09:40.381 --> 00:09:41.381
You think so?

00:09:45.021 --> 00:09:46.191
Hey, hold still for a second.

00:10:01.431 --> 00:10:02.871
If I do this like this,

00:10:04.071 --> 00:10:05.771
it releases a hormone that gets rid of stress,

00:10:06.241 --> 00:10:07.341
and your worries disappear.

00:10:09.211 --> 00:10:11.411

Even the undefeated Mr. Shin couldn't get that ordinance changed.

00:10:53.991 --> 00:10:55.391
And yet, you did it.

00:10:55.861 --> 00:10:56.961
You were the one behind it, right?

00:10:57.121 --> 00:10:59.461
Mr. Shin and many others helped me a lot.

00:10:59.891 --> 00:11:03.101
Right. So, how's Mr. Shin been lately?

00:11:06.131 --> 00:11:09.441
I think he's really worried about Yun Dong Hee.

00:11:09.941 --> 00:11:11.101
Is that so?

00:11:11.711 --> 00:11:14.171
- Did he tell you that himself? - No. I found out myself.

00:11:14.571 --> 00:11:17.111
You're the one who told me to find things out on my own.

00:11:18.381 --> 00:11:22.021
It's good you want to help Mr. Shin and protect him,

00:11:22.221 --> 00:11:24.721
but the police have to be the ones to catch Yun Dong Hee.

00:11:25.351 --> 00:11:27.051
That's the only way Mr. Shin won't get hurt.

00:11:27.421 --> 00:11:29.821
Also, bring me the report on the ordinance amendment,

00:11:30.161 --> 00:11:33.331
- so I can use it for reference. - But given Mr. Shin's situation...

00:11:33.361 --> 00:11:36.031
I know. I'm very worried about Mr. Shin too.

He was almost murdered by a patient he'd been counselling,

(Director Lee Heo Jun, Simdo Psychiatric Clinic)

00:15:31.971 --> 00:15:33.231
(Director Lee Heo Jun)

00:15:36.971 --> 00:15:39.341
What kind of man is he? Yun Dong Hee.

00:15:40.941 --> 00:15:44.311
Why are you so curious about Yun Dong Hee?

00:15:45.111 --> 00:15:46.981
Because Jun is no longer with us.

00:15:49.121 --> 00:15:50.381
But that monster, Yun Dong Hee,

00:15:51.551 --> 00:15:53.151
gets to walk around like nothing happened.

00:15:54.091 --> 00:15:56.661
So, what you're really curious about is...

00:15:57.721 --> 00:16:01.661
why Yun Dong Hee did what he did, isn't it?

00:16:03.561 --> 00:16:04.561
More than that.

00:16:07.671 --> 00:16:09.301
I'm planning to put an end to it.

00:16:11.101 --> 00:16:12.671
So it is anger.

00:16:13.941 --> 00:16:16.881
Anger can be what keeps us going,

00:16:18.141 --> 00:16:21.751
but if you hold on to it too long, it will eat you up inside.

00:16:23.921 --> 00:16:25.021
I don't care.

00:16:29.721 --> 00:16:32.131
If that's how you're coping,

00:16:34.431 --> 00:16:35.631
I won't try to stop you.

00:16:38.561 --> 00:16:42.541
Are you saying it's okay for me to get my revenge?

00:16:47.771 --> 00:16:50.411
That depends on what kind of revenge.

00:16:53.481 --> 00:16:56.751
You're the first person who's ever said that to me.

00:16:58.021 --> 00:17:01.191
And this is the first time I've ever opened up to anyone like this.

00:17:02.321 --> 00:17:03.591
That's a good start.

00:17:06.061 --> 00:17:08.061
I'm glad I came here.

00:17:10.561 --> 00:17:11.561
Well, then.

00:17:12.101 --> 00:17:13.231
I should get going.

00:17:13.771 --> 00:17:14.831
Of course.

I don't know who's playing games.

No one is going to touch it.

You and this money are all I have.

Yes, sir.

No, it's okay. You've helped me more than enough.

If you get a headache from no sleep, take the headache medicine.

You might get sleepy after the rush, so chew some gum during your break.

Do you have any idea how worried I've been?

00:25:07.471 --> 00:25:08.611
But I just...

00:25:10.211 --> 00:25:14.451
I went to the ZB1 concert, and I wanted to surprise you.

Who said you could just come back to Korea?

00:25:26.891 --> 00:25:27.961
I'll take her.

You don't recognise me? Don't you remember?

- Who are you? - Right.

00:26:00.261 --> 00:26:02.191
It's been a while, so I get it.

00:26:03.331 --> 00:26:05.601
I'm your father.

00:26:07.171 --> 00:26:10.541
Ji Woo, there's something in there that I really need right now.

00:26:10.601 --> 00:26:11.641
Hey! What are you doing?

00:26:11.701 --> 00:26:13.611
Wait, hold on. Just stay still for a second, okay?

00:26:14.211 --> 00:26:15.211
Just a second.

00:26:21.381 --> 00:26:22.511
Ji Woo!

00:26:25.951 --> 00:26:28.121
Ji Woo! Have a good life.

00:26:51.011 --> 00:26:52.341
Did something happen to you?

00:26:53.881 --> 00:26:54.881
Did he...

00:27:03.861 --> 00:27:06.761
I had no idea that happened when I was little.

00:27:08.561 --> 00:27:10.631
Why can't I remember any of it?

00:27:12.401 --> 00:27:15.631
They say you can block out memories if the trauma is too great.

00:27:17.001 --> 00:27:18.301
That's what the doctor said.

00:27:18.441 --> 00:27:21.211
So that's why you didn't want me to come to Korea.

00:27:23.641 --> 00:27:25.581
And I had no idea.

00:27:29.481 --> 00:27:31.721
- He's here. - Right.

00:27:32.021 --> 00:27:33.151
Did you get hurt anywhere?

00:27:33.621 --> 00:27:34.651
I'm fine.

Ji Woo, say hello.

00:27:45.331 --> 00:27:48.601
He's the man I just told you about, the one who saved you back then.

00:27:49.131 --> 00:27:50.141
Right.

00:27:54.171 --> 00:27:55.511

I made you wild abalone porridge. It's easy to digest.

- Why am I so nervous? - Hey, for someone who's so nervous,

00:29:38.811 --> 00:29:40.211
why are you making such a big deal...

00:29:40.211 --> 00:29:41.581
about "wild" this and "protein" that?

00:29:41.881 --> 00:29:43.881
You're pressuring her so much, she'll get an upset stomach.

I didn't use a sewing machine. I sewed every single stitch by hand.

- Thank you. - That'll just give her cavities.

00:31:12.441 --> 00:31:13.741
Then we're on the same page.

00:31:14.271 --> 00:31:16.441
You do things your way,

00:31:16.841 --> 00:31:18.711
and I'll do what I can.

00:31:19.611 --> 00:31:20.881
You're something else.

00:31:21.711 --> 00:31:23.751
So stubborn. You really are.

00:31:28.751 --> 00:31:31.121
(Gyeonggi Bukbu Police Agency)

00:31:31.491 --> 00:31:34.491
- He's here! Everyone, get ready. - Come on, on your feet.

00:31:37.331 --> 00:31:38.801
Hey! A round of applause!

00:31:40.731 --> 00:31:44.001
Hey, cut it out. What, applause for getting stabbed?

00:31:44.101 --> 00:31:47.811
Seriously. How dare they hurt one of our best?

00:31:48.271 --> 00:31:51.741
Our team will catch jerk, Yun Dong Hee! Got it?

00:31:51.741 --> 00:31:53.151
- Yes, sir! - Give me a break.

00:31:53.151 --> 00:31:54.781
What a circus. Darn it.

00:31:54.781 --> 00:31:57.351
Since the investigation went public, he's been like this every morning.

00:31:58.281 --> 00:31:59.421
Hey, come here a second.

00:32:01.351 --> 00:32:03.161
Any word from the police substation?

00:32:03.591 --> 00:32:04.861
Are you kidding?

00:32:05.221 --> 00:32:06.791
We're getting reports on every death,

00:32:06.791 --> 00:32:08.391
down to seniors who died of old age.

00:32:08.791 --> 00:32:11.061
Come with me to the scene where I was stabbed.

00:32:11.331 --> 00:32:13.071
- Why are we going there? - Doesn't it seem off to you?

00:32:13.571 --> 00:32:15.171
This time, the pattern's different.

00:32:15.571 --> 00:32:19.071
He always stages them as accidents. He's a perfectionist in his own way.

00:32:19.271 --> 00:32:20.571
But this time, it was on a main road.

00:32:20.571 --> 00:32:22.271
And he was even carrying a knife.

00:32:22.941 --> 00:32:23.981
Let's go.

00:32:38.191 --> 00:32:42.031
The last person my wife spoke to was the hospital director.

00:32:42.591 --> 00:32:43.861
You mean Director Lee Heo Jun?

00:32:44.531 --> 00:32:45.931
From the Federal Medical Center?

00:32:51.841 --> 00:32:54.571
Every time money is spent from Yun Dong Hee's account,

00:32:55.841 --> 00:32:57.881
someone is going to die.

00:33:04.321 --> 00:33:05.351
Watch out!

00:33:08.651 --> 00:33:12.821
While Yun Dong Hee was in detention, Director Lee Heo Jun was also there.

00:33:13.531 --> 00:33:15.661
- What? - He was his counsellor.

00:33:16.401 --> 00:33:20.101
The two of them might go back further than we think.

00:33:26.641 --> 00:33:29.341
Are you okay? Hey, can you hear me?

00:33:35.611 --> 00:33:38.881
He either got Yun Dong Hee released or he's a target.

00:33:39.151 --> 00:33:40.551
It's got to be one or the other.

00:33:40.821 --> 00:33:44.191
So, Detective Choi, which do you think is more likely?

00:33:47.691 --> 00:33:48.791
Sir.

00:33:49.491 --> 00:33:51.901
- Are you done here? Should we go? - Let's go.

00:34:01.041 --> 00:34:02.041
Hey, mister.

00:34:02.741 --> 00:34:03.781
Hold on a second.

00:34:07.381 --> 00:34:08.381
(Choi Cheol, National Police)

00:34:09.581 --> 00:34:12.781
- What are you doing at this house? - I was just passing by.

00:34:12.851 --> 00:34:15.091
Come on, I just saw you snooping around the front gate.

00:34:15.151 --> 00:34:18.561
I wasn't snooping. I was just admiring the house. It's my style.

00:34:18.721 --> 00:34:19.761
Let me see your ID.

00:34:19.961 --> 00:34:23.801
But I haven't done anything wrong. Can you stop anyone for no reason?

00:34:23.861 --> 00:34:27.001
You were acting suspiciously. Now give me your ID.

00:34:27.001 --> 00:34:30.201
Excuse us, sir. There was a recent incident here.

00:34:30.471 --> 00:34:32.801
This is part of our investigation, so we'd appreciate your cooperation.

00:34:33.271 --> 00:34:35.871
Look, I used to be a riot cop myself.

00:34:36.381 --> 00:34:38.241
I trained at Jeungpyeong.

00:34:40.111 --> 00:34:41.111
There. Are we good?

00:34:43.181 --> 00:34:44.551
Gosh, what spoiled luck.

00:34:45.881 --> 00:34:48.521
Hey, what did you just say? You just spat, didn't you?

00:34:48.591 --> 00:34:49.691
- Sir. - No, I didn't.

00:34:49.761 --> 00:34:51.221
What do you mean? You just did.

00:34:51.621 --> 00:34:53.061
- No, I was just pretending. - Hey, get over here!

00:34:53.131 --> 00:34:54.831
- I was just pretending. - You just spat on the ground!

00:34:55.131 --> 00:34:56.601
That's a 100-dollar fine for you.

00:34:56.601 --> 00:34:58.061
- That's enough. - I said get over here.

00:34:58.601 --> 00:35:01.471
That's enough. You're not even fully recovered.

00:35:01.901 --> 00:35:03.171
Seriously.

00:35:04.441 --> 00:35:06.671
All right, it should be over.

00:35:07.441 --> 00:35:10.911
I hope she didn't get off by one on the answer sheet or something.

00:35:12.611 --> 00:35:14.951
Don't you think you worry too much? It's not like you, Mr. Shin.

00:35:15.351 --> 00:35:19.791
Look who's talking. You're a nervous wreck about Si On.

00:35:20.691 --> 00:35:22.051
I have faith in Si On.

00:35:22.651 --> 00:35:24.261
What's that supposed to mean?

00:35:24.561 --> 00:35:26.731
You think I'm doing this because I don't trust her?

00:35:28.961 --> 00:35:30.031
Si On!

00:35:34.031 --> 00:35:37.041
You worked so hard. Good job. How did it go?

00:35:37.771 --> 00:35:40.171
Let's not talk about the test.

00:35:40.941 --> 00:35:41.941
- All right, let's go. - Let's go.

00:35:42.011 --> 00:35:43.281
- Let's go. - Okay.

00:35:49.058 --> 00:35:50.058
This is amazing.

00:35:50.958 --> 00:35:52.658
Isn't this a bit much, Mr. Shin?

00:35:53.058 --> 00:35:54.968
- What? - Let's eat up.

00:35:55.028 --> 00:35:56.068
Because I don't think we'll ever have...

00:35:56.068 --> 00:35:57.138
a company dinner like this again.

00:35:57.898 --> 00:35:59.538
Don't we get a company dinner for the CSAT too?

00:36:00.106 --> 00:36:01.576
Are you going to take the CSAT, Si On?

00:36:02.176 --> 00:36:03.916
I just realised something.

00:36:04.416 --> 00:36:06.416
I think I might have a knack for studying.

00:36:07.116 --> 00:36:09.286
Don't you think it's because you have an excellent tutor?

00:36:09.416 --> 00:36:14.256
What does that matter? The point is Si On's taking the CSAT.

00:36:15.056 --> 00:36:16.696
I'll get you all the CSAT exam tips.

00:36:16.696 --> 00:36:17.726
Deal!

00:36:24.036 --> 00:36:27.736
Pillip, you were really zeroed in on that lobster earlier.

00:36:27.936 --> 00:36:30.206
Excuse me, I have a reservation under the name Shin Mal Ja.

00:36:30.706 --> 00:36:32.676
I changed my name ages ago.

00:36:32.676 --> 00:36:33.706
Dad?

00:36:34.806 --> 00:36:35.806
What?

00:36:36.516 --> 00:36:37.516
Judge Cho!

00:36:37.576 --> 00:36:41.286
Son! Since you were eating out, we decided to eat out as well.

00:36:42.186 --> 00:36:44.386
- A company dinner? - And this is my boss.

00:36:44.386 --> 00:36:47.056
Hello, Judge Kim Sang Geun recommended him,

00:36:47.056 --> 00:36:49.226
and your Judge Cho is helping me so much.

00:36:49.456 --> 00:36:52.526
You've certainly raised a fine, dependable son.

00:36:52.596 --> 00:36:53.796
- Thank you so much. - Is that right?

00:36:56.766 --> 00:36:58.066
Hello.

00:37:00.206 --> 00:37:03.106
This is Lee Si On. She works with Mr. Shin here.

00:37:04.376 --> 00:37:05.706
It's nice to meet you.

00:37:07.046 --> 00:37:08.946
Enjoy your meal. I'll see you at home.

00:37:08.946 --> 00:37:09.946
Okay, dear.

00:37:09.946 --> 00:37:12.246
Perhaps you could join us for dessert?

00:37:12.276 --> 00:37:14.146
No, that's quite all right.

00:37:14.586 --> 00:37:15.646
Please, enjoy your meal.

00:37:16.046 --> 00:37:19.886
Let's go. So tactless to offer dessert. You all have a good time.

00:37:20.986 --> 00:37:23.156
- You have a wonderful evening. - Thank you. Enjoy your meal.

00:37:23.226 --> 00:37:24.256
- Yes, of course. - Thanks.

Si On! Hold on a second.

00:37:55.286 --> 00:37:57.656
Just a minute. Come on in.

00:37:57.796 --> 00:37:58.856
We have a situation.

(Hujin Arcade)

00:38:10.836 --> 00:38:12.776
Wait, what's wrong? What happened?

00:38:12.906 --> 00:38:14.646
Pluto isn't open.

00:38:15.006 --> 00:38:17.246
- What? - Mr. Jang won't pick up either.

00:38:18.746 --> 00:38:20.286
(Pluto)

00:38:20.486 --> 00:38:23.886
Chil Bong, did you two fight again?

00:38:24.016 --> 00:38:25.816
It wasn't me this time.

00:38:26.556 --> 00:38:28.426
He called me yesterday, crying.

00:38:28.686 --> 00:38:30.326
Apparently, he fought with his girlfriend.

00:38:30.696 --> 00:38:32.356
Mr. Jang has a girlfriend?

00:38:32.426 --> 00:38:34.066
Yes. She's in Andong.

00:38:34.366 --> 00:38:35.366
A long-distance relationship?

00:38:35.366 --> 00:38:38.336
Come on. His legs aren't that long.

00:38:39.366 --> 00:38:41.106
They were about to meet the parents,

00:38:41.106 --> 00:38:43.706
and now he's a mess with cold feet.

00:38:44.536 --> 00:38:47.846
But he can't just close up shop.

00:38:47.946 --> 00:38:49.976
What are his regular customers supposed to do?

00:38:54.246 --> 00:38:57.056
All right, this won't do. I need you two to go...

00:38:57.186 --> 00:38:58.486
and bring him back.

00:38:59.786 --> 00:39:01.926
- The two of us? - Yes.

00:39:02.086 --> 00:39:03.226
Where are we supposed to go get him?

00:39:03.286 --> 00:39:06.026
To Andong, of course. Both of you.

00:39:08.526 --> 00:39:09.626
So the two of you are going?

00:39:10.996 --> 00:39:12.266
I'd hear Mr. Jang...

00:39:12.666 --> 00:39:15.206
on the phone sometimes with someone,

00:39:15.206 --> 00:39:16.636
but I didn't know it was long-distance.

00:39:18.536 --> 00:39:19.736
What I'm wondering is...

00:39:19.736 --> 00:39:21.846
Why did Mr. Shin send just the two of us?

00:39:24.116 --> 00:39:26.546
Another reason besides bringing Mr. Jang?

00:39:26.546 --> 00:39:27.586
Yes.

00:39:29.286 --> 00:39:31.016
A reason to send us this far away on purpose.

00:39:53.193 --> 00:39:54.893
Okay. I'm starving.

- Enjoy your meal! - Thank you.

00:40:05.373 --> 00:40:07.843
We work at a fried chicken place, but we came all the way...

00:40:07.903 --> 00:40:09.443
to Andong to eat braised chicken?

00:40:09.443 --> 00:40:11.043
But it's what they're famous for here.

00:40:14.783 --> 00:40:15.783
Is it any good?

00:40:27.663 --> 00:40:28.793
Time to dig in.

00:40:57.753 --> 00:40:58.893
Mr. Jang!

00:40:58.893 --> 00:41:00.423
- He's still not picking up. - The number you dialled...

00:41:00.423 --> 00:41:01.423
is not available.

00:41:01.463 --> 00:41:03.393
We texted him, so let's just wait and see.

00:41:09.333 --> 00:41:10.333
Hey, wait up!

00:41:11.333 --> 00:41:12.433
Hurry up.

00:41:30.523 --> 00:41:32.323
Mr. Shin? We got here okay.

00:41:32.493 --> 00:41:34.623
Hey. Have you met with Mr. Jang?

00:41:34.823 --> 00:41:37.193
Not yet. I texted him, but he hasn't gotten back to me.

00:41:37.663 --> 00:41:38.863
Mr. Shin, what are you up to?

00:41:39.363 --> 00:41:41.963
What do you think? I'm frying chicken.

00:41:42.503 --> 00:41:45.973
It's swamped here with you and Si On gone.

00:41:47.103 --> 00:41:48.903
All right. Make sure you bring him back.

00:41:49.343 --> 00:41:50.343
I'm hanging up.

Sure!

00:42:11.633 --> 00:42:13.193
Careful! You'll get hurt.

Whatever.

00:42:35.223 --> 00:42:36.223
Si On.

00:42:36.683 --> 00:42:37.723
Yes?

00:42:37.723 --> 00:42:38.753
What's your dream?

00:42:38.893 --> 00:42:39.923
My dream?

00:42:43.893 --> 00:42:45.563
For my grandma to be healthy...

00:42:46.333 --> 00:42:49.363
- and for Ye On to grow up well? - Besides your grandma and Ye On.

00:42:50.603 --> 00:42:51.603
Your dream.

00:42:52.873 --> 00:42:54.203
Isn't there anything you want to do for yourself?

00:42:59.673 --> 00:43:01.083
To be honest,

00:43:02.443 --> 00:43:04.283
I didn't really have any dreams before.

00:43:05.213 --> 00:43:06.383
But I do now.

00:43:07.083 --> 00:43:08.083
What is it?

00:43:08.853 --> 00:43:11.323
It's a secret. I'll tell you after the CSAT.

00:43:11.753 --> 00:43:14.293
- Why? Just tell me now. - No.

00:43:14.423 --> 00:43:15.493

Mr. Jang.

00:43:31.313 --> 00:43:32.613
We were all so worried.

00:43:33.643 --> 00:43:36.383
I'm sorry. I was drinking until dawn...

00:43:36.843 --> 00:43:39.453
and cried myself to sleep, so I didn't even realise you called.

00:43:40.153 --> 00:43:43.023
Mr. Shin told us to bring you back.

00:43:43.623 --> 00:43:46.153
Mr. Jang, did you break up with your girlfriend?

00:43:50.363 --> 00:43:51.363
I'm sorry.

00:43:51.733 --> 00:43:54.003
I'll call you guys later.

00:44:00.303 --> 00:44:02.303

- just ask someone that. - I'm sorry.

- Attention! At ease! - No, I was just...

00:44:13.853 --> 00:44:15.323
Was that a bad thing to ask?

00:44:16.423 --> 00:44:18.293
Let's just go.

00:44:18.423 --> 00:44:19.623

It's a hit! A hit!

00:45:13.613 --> 00:45:16.083
- It's a hit! - Congratulations!

Congratulations.

00:46:06.493 --> 00:46:07.563
Hey. Do me a favour.

00:46:08.733 --> 00:46:09.733
I don't want to.

00:46:10.063 --> 00:46:13.473
I think someone's tailing me. Go get the money from that guy for me.

00:46:15.343 --> 00:46:16.343
What? And why would I do that?

00:46:20.213 --> 00:46:22.183
Darn it! Thirty grand!

00:46:22.483 --> 00:46:23.683
I'll give you half.

00:46:24.083 --> 00:46:26.213
This is a huge deal. A really huge deal!

00:46:26.683 --> 00:46:27.683
Have you heard of him?

Lee Heo Jun, director of the Forensic Medical Office.

00:46:31.923 --> 00:46:34.393
Who? Who did you just say that was?

Lee Heo Jun!

00:46:36.063 --> 00:46:38.563
I got his car plate number and his accomplice.

00:46:38.563 --> 00:46:39.593
Who's the accomplice?

00:46:39.693 --> 00:46:41.403
The accomplice? Beats me.

00:46:41.903 --> 00:46:43.203
Guess you'll find out from the USB.

00:46:43.503 --> 00:46:46.573
- Are you going to help me? - Where's the USB drive?

00:46:46.873 --> 00:46:49.773
- I've hidden the original. - What I have with me is a copy.

00:46:50.203 --> 00:46:51.213
Where are you now?

00:46:51.643 --> 00:46:52.873
I'm heading to the meeting spot.

00:46:53.873 --> 00:46:55.983
And I already shook the guy who was following me.

00:46:57.183 --> 00:46:58.813
Postpone the deal until tomorrow.

00:46:59.253 --> 00:47:00.253
What? Why?

00:47:00.253 --> 00:47:02.253
Tell him you want to meet him tomorrow, then go dark.

00:47:04.523 --> 00:47:07.323
Listen, Kim Yong Woo. If you want to live, do as I say.

00:47:07.493 --> 00:47:08.493
Got it?

00:47:09.923 --> 00:47:10.933
Okay.

00:47:10.993 --> 00:47:14.603
I'll get the money for you, so where did you hide the original?

00:47:19.633 --> 00:47:20.703
Don't you want the money?

00:47:23.103 --> 00:47:24.513
Somewhere Joo Yeong Mi would know.

00:47:26.343 --> 00:47:27.343
Got it.

00:47:28.343 --> 00:47:29.343
We'll talk in person.

00:49:17.923 --> 00:49:19.293
Looks like he's dead.

00:49:19.723 --> 00:49:20.993
I think he's dead.

00:49:21.523 --> 00:49:24.293
- I think he's dead! - What do we do?

00:49:26.293 --> 00:49:28.303
- What do we do? - They say it was a hit-and-run.

00:49:28.363 --> 00:49:29.563
Please stay back.

00:49:38.813 --> 00:49:40.213

Yes.

Sir, it's a hit-and-run. The victim's a man in his 40s.

00:50:21.453 --> 00:50:23.023
Right. Got it.

He's the guy I had a run-in with in front of Lee Heo Jun's house.

00:50:47.713 --> 00:50:48.813
Check for witnesses.

00:50:49.383 --> 00:50:50.383
