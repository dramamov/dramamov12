00:00:52.685 --> 00:00:59.426
Takami Family's Grave

00:01:04.364 --> 00:01:05.365
Excuse me.

00:01:07.434 --> 00:01:09.202
Excuse me. Where is Ms. Saejima?

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:11.704
It seems she moved.

00:01:12.405 --> 00:01:13.640
Do you know where she is now?

00:01:13.706 --> 00:01:15.408
How the hell should I know?

00:01:16.176 --> 00:01:18.044
Regardless, it's got
nothing to do with us.

00:01:25.585 --> 00:01:26.586
Ms. Koreeda.

00:01:33.793 --> 00:01:35.962
It seems Ms. Saejima has disappeared.

00:01:36.729 --> 00:01:39.933
Kanzaki came to ask
if I knew anything.

00:01:40.967 --> 00:01:42.769
So you don't know either?

00:01:43.069 --> 00:01:44.070
No.

00:01:44.437 --> 00:01:46.840
It looks like Ms. Isshiki
hasn't heard from her either.

00:01:49.242 --> 00:01:51.511
I'm worried about Kanzaki.

00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:07.927
MR. MIKAMI'S CLASSROOM

00:02:08.695 --> 00:02:11.531
Tazune, your dad's textbooks
are amazing.

00:02:13.233 --> 00:02:14.801
Especially parts like this.

00:02:15.168 --> 00:02:17.670
"Now, close the textbook and think."

00:02:18.104 --> 00:02:21.007
You can't move on until
you've really thought it through.

00:02:23.843 --> 00:02:25.145
Dad always told me that

00:02:26.045 --> 00:02:30.450
studying is meaningless
unless you think about it.

00:02:33.086 --> 00:02:34.821
That's like what Okami says, too.

00:02:35.855 --> 00:02:36.856
What?

00:02:39.058 --> 00:02:40.827
Sorry if this
makes you uncomfortable.

00:02:42.762 --> 00:02:43.763
But, you know...

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:47.667
I think in his own way,
Okami is worried about you.

00:02:48.301 --> 00:02:51.571
I also think he feels
some sense of responsibility.

00:02:52.805 --> 00:02:56.876
I haven't quite processed that yet.

00:03:00.847 --> 00:03:01.848
I see.

00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:10.089
Actually, I have
something I want to do.

00:03:10.990 --> 00:03:12.992
Can you help me, Tominaga?

00:03:24.103 --> 00:03:25.104
Welcome.

00:03:28.074 --> 00:03:29.075
This way, please.

00:03:30.877 --> 00:03:34.113
I'm sorry you had to pick the place,
even though I asked to meet.

00:03:34.347 --> 00:03:36.950
No problem.
I prefer meeting in a place I trust.

00:03:37.050 --> 00:03:38.818
I'm just a cautious person.

00:03:39.852 --> 00:03:41.487
Do you come here often?

00:03:41.788 --> 00:03:43.590
People have started to figure out
they can find me here

00:03:43.690 --> 00:03:45.692
so I think it may be time
for a change.

00:03:46.626 --> 00:03:48.761
It must be tough being so popular.

00:03:49.562 --> 00:03:51.831
So, what's this about?

00:03:52.765 --> 00:03:55.301
There's nothing urgent.

00:03:56.269 --> 00:03:58.104
I just thought we needed
a system where we can talk

00:03:58.204 --> 00:03:59.806
even without Mr. Tsukada.

00:04:00.573 --> 00:04:02.375
I appreciate that.

00:04:03.910 --> 00:04:05.578
I need support.

00:04:06.479 --> 00:04:11.884
As you know,
Tsukada values his position dearly.

00:04:13.386 --> 00:04:17.523
From here on, I'll have to be
the one taking on the dirty work.

00:04:18.391 --> 00:04:21.928
I'd really like to
have your help, Mr. Nakaoka.

00:04:22.996 --> 00:04:25.431
The 21st Rintoku Festival

00:04:25.531 --> 00:04:27.200
May I have your attention
for a moment?

00:04:31.504 --> 00:04:33.006
For the upcoming Rintoku Festival

00:04:33.072 --> 00:04:35.241
I want to organize
an independent project.

00:04:35.475 --> 00:04:37.410
What? What kind of project?

00:04:38.611 --> 00:04:40.346
I want to research
and display information

00:04:40.413 --> 00:04:42.115
about textbook screenings.

00:04:43.116 --> 00:04:46.653
Here's the proposal.
Can you pass it around?

00:04:46.953 --> 00:04:49.322
Seniors are supposed to be
studying on their own. Is this okay?

00:04:49.422 --> 00:04:50.857
Participation is voluntary

00:04:50.957 --> 00:04:52.392
so the school
shouldn't be able to stop us.

00:04:52.759 --> 00:04:54.594
I doubt they'll approve
something like this.

00:04:55.395 --> 00:04:56.896
At least take a look at it first.

00:04:57.196 --> 00:05:01.200
– I don't want any trouble.
– Same here.

00:05:01.668 --> 00:05:04.437
– I'll do it.
– You're joking, right, Wakui?

00:05:04.637 --> 00:05:08.007
Private school students
usually don't participate

00:05:08.374 --> 00:05:10.176
but there are other schools
where they do.

00:05:11.678 --> 00:05:14.180
If anyone else is interested,
just let us know.

00:05:17.650 --> 00:05:19.886
Tominaga.
You need me for this, don't you?

00:05:19.986 --> 00:05:22.755
– It's mandatory for you, Jigen.
– Roger that.

00:05:23.356 --> 00:05:24.891
– Hey, Ihara Sora.
– What?

00:05:24.991 --> 00:05:26.893
– It's mandatory for you, too.
– No way!

00:05:26.993 --> 00:05:29.395
– Hatano, what about you?
– Of course, I'll be studying.

00:05:29.495 --> 00:05:30.730
Yeah, that's understandable.

00:05:44.077 --> 00:05:45.078
Good morning.

00:05:45.511 --> 00:05:46.846
Good morning.

00:05:54.487 --> 00:05:56.622
Mr. Mikami, please start the lesson.

00:05:56.723 --> 00:05:57.724
What do you mean?

00:05:57.957 --> 00:06:00.426
I sensed you were about to
start talking about that topic.

00:06:00.526 --> 00:06:02.495
Of course, I came here to teach.

00:06:03.663 --> 00:06:05.064
All right, today's lesson...

00:06:08.101 --> 00:06:09.502
If you're just copying something down

00:06:09.569 --> 00:06:12.572
you could just take a picture with
your phone and be done with it.

00:06:13.005 --> 00:06:18.411
But if you're writing it while
thinking about possible mistakes

00:06:19.045 --> 00:06:20.446
it naturally sticks in your mind.

00:06:22.215 --> 00:06:24.317
Which probably
connects to this, but...

00:06:24.417 --> 00:06:26.386
Please don't get involved in this.

00:06:26.519 --> 00:06:28.855
Then, I'll just say one thing
without touching on the content.

00:06:29.956 --> 00:06:33.025
With this plan, you probably won't
get permission to use this classroom.

00:06:34.327 --> 00:06:37.697
Is it okay to use class time
just to push your own ideas?

00:06:37.797 --> 00:06:39.465
That wasn't my intention.

00:06:39.532 --> 00:06:41.734
But it's such an interesting topic.

00:06:44.637 --> 00:06:47.039
– Kurayoshi.
– What? Me?

00:06:47.240 --> 00:06:48.341
That's right.

00:06:48.408 --> 00:06:51.544
In America, how do they
teach about the atomic bomb?

00:06:54.113 --> 00:06:55.848
Well...

00:06:56.949 --> 00:07:00.086
– Is it hard to say?
– Of course it is.

00:07:00.253 --> 00:07:01.487
Then should I say it?

00:07:01.921 --> 00:07:03.890
No, I'll say it.

00:07:04.991 --> 00:07:06.325
I want to say it.

00:07:07.593 --> 00:07:08.594
Go ahead.

00:07:13.833 --> 00:07:14.834
So...

00:07:16.302 --> 00:07:20.139
In America, they teach that
the atomic bombings were...

00:07:23.075 --> 00:07:25.378
unavoidable.

00:07:25.578 --> 00:07:26.579
What?

00:07:27.947 --> 00:07:29.215
That's ridiculous.

00:07:29.715 --> 00:07:34.120
The US had already warned Japan
that if we continued the war

00:07:34.187 --> 00:07:36.622
they would launch
a devastating attack.

00:07:36.722 --> 00:07:40.226
In other words, they would
drop the atomic bomb.

00:07:40.960 --> 00:07:42.528
So what if they warned us?

00:07:43.329 --> 00:07:48.935
The textbooks say
the then US president stated...

00:07:51.304 --> 00:07:53.473
"If the war continues

00:07:53.573 --> 00:07:55.541
a mainland battle
will be inevitable.

00:07:56.776 --> 00:08:00.012
To prevent further sacrifices
of our American youths

00:08:01.080 --> 00:08:04.550
the atomic bomb was unavoidable."

00:08:05.518 --> 00:08:06.519
That's insane.

00:08:06.619 --> 00:08:08.621
That's what the textbook says.

00:08:10.223 --> 00:08:12.225
However, it also asks
a certain question.

00:08:13.793 --> 00:08:17.163
"Do you think
the president's opinion was correct?

00:08:17.463 --> 00:08:21.334
Explain your opinion and reasoning."

00:08:23.636 --> 00:08:24.904
What did you answer?

00:08:32.612 --> 00:08:34.113
I couldn't.

00:08:35.114 --> 00:08:36.182
What?

00:08:36.249 --> 00:08:39.752
Unbelievable.
You're Japanese, aren't you?

00:08:39.886 --> 00:08:43.489
Everyone was looking at me,
just like now.

00:08:44.123 --> 00:08:45.458
I had no deep knowledge.

00:08:45.958 --> 00:08:48.961
And as someone raised in America

00:08:49.562 --> 00:08:53.266
I felt like my opinion would be taken
as the Japanese consensus.

00:08:53.332 --> 00:08:54.700
I was scared.

00:08:56.035 --> 00:08:57.570
So, I couldn't answer.

00:09:03.342 --> 00:09:07.947
Now, I think I could
answer a little better.

00:09:09.549 --> 00:09:10.650
What would you say?

00:09:12.318 --> 00:09:15.254
Japan should have ended
the war sooner

00:09:16.088 --> 00:09:18.991
and America still shouldn't have
dropped the bomb.

00:09:20.092 --> 00:09:22.995
In other words, both were wrong.

00:09:23.629 --> 00:09:24.630
Why?

00:09:25.831 --> 00:09:31.037
In Okinawa,
countless civilians lost their lives.

00:09:31.304 --> 00:09:34.040
That number alone
should have been enough for Japan

00:09:34.140 --> 00:09:37.043
to realize they needed to
end the war.

00:09:37.777 --> 00:09:38.978
What about America?

00:09:40.913 --> 00:09:44.584
People say the atomic bomb
was unforgivable

00:09:45.718 --> 00:09:49.522
because it instantly took
so many lives.

00:09:50.389 --> 00:09:56.162
But I kept wondering,
was it really just about the numbers?

00:09:56.596 --> 00:09:59.065
I struggled with that question a lot.

00:10:00.566 --> 00:10:06.639
But in the end, a bomb that
destroys cells

00:10:06.739 --> 00:10:12.244
and causes decades-long health issues
should never have been used.

00:10:14.747 --> 00:10:15.748
That's true.

00:10:17.516 --> 00:10:21.587
That's why, in future lessons

00:10:22.188 --> 00:10:26.525
I want both sides to be
acknowledged as being wrong.

00:10:38.204 --> 00:10:39.739
What are you trying to say?

00:10:40.573 --> 00:10:44.677
Making Kurayoshi say all that,
digging up her past trauma.

00:10:45.311 --> 00:10:49.515
Do you even realize
how sensitive this topic is?

00:10:50.249 --> 00:10:53.052
– Of course I do.
– You heard Kurayoshi, right?

00:10:55.588 --> 00:10:58.991
There are textbooks that
justify the atomic bombings.

00:10:59.759 --> 00:11:02.161
Because to that country,
that was just.

00:11:02.962 --> 00:11:05.598
Similarly, every nation and
every person has their own justice.

00:11:06.966 --> 00:11:09.368
If you believe
only your justice is right,

00:11:09.602 --> 00:11:11.170
you won't be able to
talk to anyone.

00:11:13.706 --> 00:11:15.174
Then what should I do?

00:11:15.274 --> 00:11:17.009
Do you want me to
give you instructions?

00:11:19.945 --> 00:11:20.946
You don't, right?

00:11:23.849 --> 00:11:24.850
Tazune.

00:11:26.452 --> 00:11:27.453
You know...

00:11:29.188 --> 00:11:30.623
It's not a traumatic experience.

00:11:31.624 --> 00:11:32.625
What?

00:11:32.725 --> 00:11:36.595
Because it almost became one,
I studied hard on the topic.

00:11:37.830 --> 00:11:39.765
When I found out I was
moving back to Japan

00:11:40.366 --> 00:11:41.967
I spoke with my classmates.

00:11:42.501 --> 00:11:43.569
I told them

00:11:43.836 --> 00:11:48.974
"I love you all and I never, ever
want to go to war with you."

00:11:51.143 --> 00:11:52.645
What did they say?

00:11:54.413 --> 00:11:56.248
They agreed.

00:11:57.049 --> 00:11:59.151
They said, "No matter what happens

00:11:59.218 --> 00:12:01.253
we should never press
the nuclear button."

00:12:01.754 --> 00:12:02.922
And so I answered

00:12:02.988 --> 00:12:06.625
"I promise to
uphold Japan's principle

00:12:06.692 --> 00:12:08.227
of not possessing nuclear weapons."

00:12:08.761 --> 00:12:10.162
I talked about it properly with them.

00:12:10.730 --> 00:12:12.932
That's why it's not traumatic.

00:12:15.668 --> 00:12:19.472
However, when I came back to Japan

00:12:20.840 --> 00:12:22.675
it became something
we couldn't even talk about.

00:12:23.409 --> 00:12:25.177
For me, that was even harder.

00:12:31.884 --> 00:12:34.987
So, Tazune...

00:12:37.089 --> 00:12:39.325
I'm grateful.

00:12:44.997 --> 00:12:46.065
I want to participate.

00:12:53.472 --> 00:12:55.441
That's the end of today's lesson.

00:12:59.645 --> 00:13:01.080
Kanzaki, you're not joining?

00:13:02.715 --> 00:13:03.716
I'm good.

00:13:05.351 --> 00:13:07.486
– Why?
– I have other things to do.

00:13:10.489 --> 00:13:12.124
Is it about Ms. Saejima?

00:13:12.658 --> 00:13:15.594
Have you
found anything out since then?

00:13:17.062 --> 00:13:18.264
No.

00:13:18.697 --> 00:13:20.699
Her email isn't working

00:13:20.933 --> 00:13:22.868
and it looks like
she canceled her phone.

00:13:28.641 --> 00:13:32.077
I think she's seriously trying
to focus on her daughter.

00:13:37.583 --> 00:13:38.584
Even so...

00:13:41.187 --> 00:13:42.955
I can't just leave things like this.

00:13:45.858 --> 00:13:46.859
Are you okay?

00:13:54.166 --> 00:13:56.135
If I hear anything,
I'll tell you right away.

00:13:56.535 --> 00:13:59.071
Let me know if anything
comes up on your end.

00:14:01.540 --> 00:14:02.541
Okay.

00:14:25.064 --> 00:14:26.232
What's the meaning of this?

00:14:26.732 --> 00:14:28.567
Is there something wrong?

00:14:29.101 --> 00:14:32.638
I already explained that,
as a rule, seniors don't participate.

00:14:32.938 --> 00:14:34.540
And this theme...

00:14:35.174 --> 00:14:36.909
I actually mentioned it
to the director.

00:14:36.976 --> 00:14:41.480
He said it's wonderful and
should definitely be done.

00:14:42.982 --> 00:14:44.016
Let me make sure.

00:14:48.420 --> 00:14:51.323
One Week Before the Rintoku Festival

00:14:52.057 --> 00:14:53.058
Mr. Mikami.

00:14:53.259 --> 00:14:54.260
Yes?

00:14:54.360 --> 00:14:55.361
Do you have a moment?

00:14:56.161 --> 00:14:57.162
What is it?

00:14:57.763 --> 00:14:58.898
What?

00:14:58.964 --> 00:15:00.266
What do you mean by that?

00:15:00.366 --> 00:15:01.934
Exactly what I said.

00:15:02.134 --> 00:15:05.905
The classroom permission
might be revoked.

00:15:06.205 --> 00:15:07.206
Why?

00:15:07.573 --> 00:15:08.841
Topics with strong political themes

00:15:08.908 --> 00:15:11.076
aren't suitable
for a high school festival.

00:15:11.677 --> 00:15:12.678
Here we go again.

00:15:12.778 --> 00:15:15.981
Then why give
18-year-olds the right to vote?

00:15:16.849 --> 00:15:19.485
But isn't this strange?
They already approved it once.

00:15:20.052 --> 00:15:21.687
It's only natural for it
to be revoked.

00:15:22.988 --> 00:15:23.989
Why?

00:15:24.256 --> 00:15:26.992
I was honestly shocked
they approved it in the first place.

00:15:28.394 --> 00:15:29.395
But...

00:15:32.531 --> 00:15:33.866
What does everyone else think?

00:15:41.106 --> 00:15:46.178
At first, I thought it was fine
since it's voluntary,

00:15:48.347 --> 00:15:50.082
but honestly, it's exhausting.

00:15:50.950 --> 00:15:51.984
Exhausting?

00:15:52.117 --> 00:15:55.487
I don't even have a place to study
during lunch anymore.

00:15:58.490 --> 00:16:00.225
Anything else?

00:16:03.662 --> 00:16:04.863
I kept getting asked

00:16:05.364 --> 00:16:08.367
"You're not participating, right?"

00:16:09.034 --> 00:16:10.035
It was tough.

00:16:10.235 --> 00:16:11.303
I feel you.

00:16:11.670 --> 00:16:13.038
It felt like those not joining

00:16:13.138 --> 00:16:16.241
were being looked down on, as if
we only care about entrance exams.

00:16:30.089 --> 00:16:31.991
All right, let's start homeroom.

00:16:32.057 --> 00:16:33.726
I have a suggestion.

00:16:36.028 --> 00:16:37.229
Let's hold a debate.

00:16:37.863 --> 00:16:39.732
After all,
there are differing opinions.

00:16:39.932 --> 00:16:42.034
Before we protest
the classroom permission issue

00:16:42.501 --> 00:16:44.236
we should think it through first.

00:16:46.305 --> 00:16:47.439
The topic will be

00:16:47.506 --> 00:16:50.676
"Do you agree or disagree with
holding an exhibition about textbooks

00:16:50.743 --> 00:16:52.644
at our school festival?"

00:16:56.315 --> 00:16:57.316
What do you think?

00:17:03.422 --> 00:17:04.790
We should do it.

00:17:06.225 --> 00:17:07.259
All right, let's try it.

00:17:07.359 --> 00:17:09.628
Sakurai will represent the pro side

00:17:09.728 --> 00:17:11.563
and Shinonome will
represent the con side.

00:17:12.364 --> 00:17:14.033
What? Why?

00:17:14.900 --> 00:17:17.703
Debates aren't about
stating your personal opinion.

00:17:18.070 --> 00:17:20.973
The pro side
presents their reasoning

00:17:21.073 --> 00:17:23.776
while the con side presents theirs.

00:17:24.510 --> 00:17:26.612
Okay, let's move the desks around.

00:17:36.789 --> 00:17:38.290
Let's start with the pro side.

00:17:38.357 --> 00:17:39.391
Sakurai.

00:17:48.133 --> 00:17:50.969
Some people don't know that textbooks
go through an approval process

00:17:51.170 --> 00:17:54.506
or that their use is mandatory.

00:17:55.240 --> 00:17:56.642
Many also don't know that

00:17:56.708 --> 00:17:58.744
few countries have
a textbook screening system.

00:18:00.446 --> 00:18:04.516
Understanding the foundation
of our learning is meaningful.

00:18:05.751 --> 00:18:07.352
That's why I support the exhibition.

00:18:07.953 --> 00:18:09.855
Shinonome, now for the con side.

00:18:09.922 --> 00:18:14.960
The con side must argue based on
the argument from the pro side.

00:18:20.099 --> 00:18:23.402
Seniors don't participate in
the festival in the first place

00:18:24.236 --> 00:18:26.538
so they can focus on exams.

00:18:27.306 --> 00:18:30.075
Moving forward
without the class's consensus

00:18:30.676 --> 00:18:35.681
infringes on the rights of students
who want to focus on studying.

00:18:36.715 --> 00:18:41.286
That's why I'm against it.

00:18:46.992 --> 00:18:48.927
Now, let's move on
to the discussion.

00:18:50.529 --> 00:18:51.697
Sakurai, go ahead.

00:18:56.135 --> 00:19:00.072
This is Article 34, Section 1
of the School Education Act.

00:19:01.306 --> 00:19:03.742
It states that textbooks approved by
the Minister of Education

00:19:03.842 --> 00:19:10.716
or textbooks for which the ministry
holds authorship rights must be used.

00:19:15.354 --> 00:19:18.657
However, the latest
curriculum guidelines

00:19:18.724 --> 00:19:20.025
emphasize on individualized learning.

00:19:20.092 --> 00:19:24.796
It means to tailor education
to each student's understanding.

00:19:24.997 --> 00:19:28.634
That contradicts the use of
a single common textbook.

00:19:29.735 --> 00:19:33.805
Shouldn't we use this exhibition
to think about that contradiction?

00:19:34.473 --> 00:19:35.574
I'm in favor.

00:19:37.643 --> 00:19:39.344
Wow, you really researched this.

00:19:39.411 --> 00:19:40.479
That's impressive.

00:19:45.784 --> 00:19:49.922
The School Education Act
is the foundation of education.

00:19:51.356 --> 00:19:55.527
If we start questioning it,
the entire system will collapse.

00:19:57.095 --> 00:19:58.130
I am against it.

00:20:07.172 --> 00:20:10.142
I looked into the class
Shinonome's father was teaching.

00:20:11.076 --> 00:20:12.411
– What?
– What?

00:20:15.113 --> 00:20:18.984
Many of his students
went on to top-tier high schools.

00:20:20.085 --> 00:20:26.491
According to newspaper articles,
graduates spoke highly of him.

00:20:27.659 --> 00:20:30.329
They say his rich lessons
taught them the joy of learning.

00:20:31.163 --> 00:20:35.567
Despite that, he lost his job
for violating curriculum guidelines.

00:20:36.902 --> 00:20:39.104
That was a great loss to education.

00:20:41.373 --> 00:20:43.408
Isn't that worth thinking about?

00:20:52.651 --> 00:20:57.322
I believe this project
should be done.

00:21:39.998 --> 00:21:43.902
I have no response to...

00:21:47.572 --> 00:21:49.241
Sakurai's words.

00:21:53.512 --> 00:21:55.580
It has been three years
since my parents divorced.

00:21:56.682 --> 00:21:58.317
And yet, I did nothing.

00:22:00.552 --> 00:22:05.357
I never even tried to learn
what my father was doing at school.

00:22:09.361 --> 00:22:15.334
I have no right to
direct my anger at Mr. Mikami.

00:22:22.941 --> 00:22:23.975
Someone like me...

00:22:26.812 --> 00:22:32.617
shouldn't be leading
a project like this.

00:22:37.489 --> 00:22:41.760
That is why I am against it.

00:23:01.413 --> 00:23:05.817
The pro side supported the project
for its educational value.

00:23:06.451 --> 00:23:10.689
The con side opposed it due to
the lack of consideration

00:23:11.289 --> 00:23:12.891
towards those who wanted to
focus on studying

00:23:12.958 --> 00:23:14.893
and the exclusion
felt by non-participants.

00:23:17.129 --> 00:23:18.864
I think we can see
what needs to be done.

00:23:23.335 --> 00:23:25.971
That reminds me.
I got an internal update today.

00:23:26.972 --> 00:23:29.775
For the festival, they will be
inviting Mr. Takizawa

00:23:29.841 --> 00:23:31.510
a politician and the deputy minister
of the Ministry of Education.

00:23:31.810 --> 00:23:33.645
– What? Seriously?
– Yes.

00:23:33.945 --> 00:23:36.381
If the government finds out that
we conducted an exhibition

00:23:36.481 --> 00:23:38.450
on textbook screening,
it could cause problems.

00:23:38.784 --> 00:23:39.985
Is that why they stepped in?

00:23:40.185 --> 00:23:41.186
Probably.

00:23:44.122 --> 00:23:45.123
What do we do?

00:23:48.360 --> 00:23:51.263
That means the person who needs to
see it the most is coming, right?

00:23:54.032 --> 00:23:55.233
I want to do it.

00:24:00.972 --> 00:24:02.674
Then, discuss the rest
among yourselves.

00:24:05.444 --> 00:24:08.547
– Let's talk, everyone.
– Yeah, where should we start?

00:24:08.680 --> 00:24:11.216
How about an opinion exchange first?

00:24:11.450 --> 00:24:12.517
Exactly.

00:24:14.219 --> 00:24:15.220
Hey.

00:24:19.624 --> 00:24:22.394
I just have a habit of
researching legal matters.

00:24:23.462 --> 00:24:24.529
That's all.

00:24:25.931 --> 00:24:27.065
Thank you. It meant a lot.

00:24:31.536 --> 00:24:32.537
Five Days Before the Rintoku Festival

00:24:32.637 --> 00:24:35.574
Mr. Mizohata, do you have a moment?

00:24:36.441 --> 00:24:39.311
I guess it's about the exhibition.
Are you withdrawing?

00:24:40.779 --> 00:24:43.748
No, I want to proceed.

00:24:45.350 --> 00:24:48.119
So, we revised the project.

00:24:48.220 --> 00:24:49.321
The 21st Rintoku Festival
Application Form

00:24:55.994 --> 00:24:59.164
– You changed it quite a bit.
– Yes.

00:25:01.333 --> 00:25:02.834
I'll review it and get back to you.

00:25:03.368 --> 00:25:04.703
Thank you.

00:25:05.904 --> 00:25:07.272
Hey, Kanzaki.

00:25:08.340 --> 00:25:09.808
Are you not coming
to the school festival?

00:25:11.042 --> 00:25:12.043
I have plans.

00:25:12.377 --> 00:25:13.945
Are you just being stubborn?

00:25:14.579 --> 00:25:16.548
There are things
I can only do on weekdays.

00:25:16.982 --> 00:25:18.083
You've heard, right?

00:25:18.450 --> 00:25:20.919
They say the exhibition was approved
using a fake proposal.

00:25:23.522 --> 00:25:24.656
Can you believe it?

00:25:25.624 --> 00:25:27.859
That goody-goody Tazune
would do something like that.

00:25:28.460 --> 00:25:30.862
That's a huge help. Thanks.

00:25:33.598 --> 00:25:36.067
There's something you should do
as the editor of the journalism club.

00:25:43.074 --> 00:25:45.110
Kanzaki, you're not joining
the school festival?

00:25:45.210 --> 00:25:47.379
Tominaga keeps
bugging me to cover it.

00:25:48.980 --> 00:25:50.949
I have an update on Mikami Kota.

00:25:51.349 --> 00:25:52.350
What is it?

00:25:52.517 --> 00:25:54.152
Hey, Lupin. Pull up yesterday's data.

00:25:54.452 --> 00:25:55.453
Okay.

00:25:57.756 --> 00:26:00.292
I found a thread on 2channel.

00:26:04.963 --> 00:26:09.100
His digital footprints
are all still there.

00:26:11.937 --> 00:26:15.073
I thought Okami was nuts,
but his brother was something else.

00:26:16.041 --> 00:26:17.576
This guy was seriously hardcore.

00:26:24.015 --> 00:26:25.150
Do you have a moment?

00:26:25.250 --> 00:26:26.618
Yes, what is it?

00:26:32.490 --> 00:26:35.060
There was a checkpoint
built to defend against

00:26:35.160 --> 00:26:36.728
the Emishi invasion by Yamato Takeru.

00:26:37.529 --> 00:26:38.897
It was located in...

00:26:42.233 --> 00:26:43.401
Kasumigaseki.

00:26:44.235 --> 00:26:45.937
Kasumigaseki

00:26:46.237 --> 00:26:51.142
So maybe Yamato Takeru
symbolizes bureaucrats.

00:26:52.777 --> 00:26:55.413
Are you Yamato Takeru, Mr. Mikami?

00:26:55.814 --> 00:26:57.182
– No.
– But...

00:26:57.282 --> 00:26:59.017
– Are you done?
– No, not yet.

00:26:59.684 --> 00:27:00.885
This is the Hirakawa Gate.

00:27:01.653 --> 00:27:07.392
It's directly opposite of
Sakurada Gate in Kasumigaseki.

00:27:08.460 --> 00:27:10.462
It is said to be
the back gate of Edo Castle.

00:27:10.528 --> 00:27:11.529
In other words

00:27:11.730 --> 00:27:14.599
many people entered Rintoku
through the back entrance.

00:27:17.335 --> 00:27:18.336
I see.

00:27:18.503 --> 00:27:20.739
And "Rintoku is
the country's blessed land."

00:27:21.106 --> 00:27:23.642
This is a parody of
Yamato Takeru's farewell poem.

00:27:24.175 --> 00:27:27.245
It was originally "Yamato is
the country's blessed land,"

00:27:27.646 --> 00:27:31.082
which means
"Yamato is a truly good country."

00:27:31.449 --> 00:27:33.852
If you write the words "blessed land"
using Chinese characters...

00:27:43.128 --> 00:27:44.729
Notice something?

00:27:46.031 --> 00:27:47.732
It's the name of the former chairman.

00:27:48.500 --> 00:27:51.169
It uses the same characters,
but is read as "Masahide."

00:27:54.372 --> 00:27:56.841
It's about Deputy Minister Takizawa's
visit to Rintoku.

00:27:57.275 --> 00:27:58.977
Makino, can you accompany him?

00:27:59.577 --> 00:28:00.812
Yes, gladly.

00:28:05.750 --> 00:28:07.819
Wow, this is incredible.

00:28:08.386 --> 00:28:10.388
A Deputy Minister
attending a school inspection?

00:28:11.423 --> 00:28:13.792
That's how much attention
this high school is getting.

00:28:14.225 --> 00:28:17.662
The school festival also draws
a huge crowd from the community.

00:28:17.762 --> 00:28:19.030
So it seems.

00:28:20.832 --> 00:28:24.169
Mr. Takizawa was
quite fond of Mikami.

00:28:28.907 --> 00:28:33.411
Make sure he doesn't
get embarrassed.

00:28:35.547 --> 00:28:36.715
Understood, sir.

00:28:37.716 --> 00:28:40.085
Three Days
Before the Rintoku Festival

00:28:46.491 --> 00:28:47.525
Mr. Mikami.

00:28:49.360 --> 00:28:52.363
The dummy proposal
has been officially approved.

00:28:52.464 --> 00:28:53.932
Is that right? I'm glad.

00:28:54.833 --> 00:28:58.336
However, the school will conduct
an inspection the day before.

00:28:58.937 --> 00:29:00.605
Well, that's to be expected.

00:29:02.173 --> 00:29:05.443
Shinonome, I heard you spoke
with every classmate individually?

00:29:06.077 --> 00:29:07.078
Yes.

00:29:07.545 --> 00:29:08.780
How did it go?

00:29:10.215 --> 00:29:11.983
Those who aren't participating

00:29:12.283 --> 00:29:15.253
said they respect
the freedom of those who are.

00:29:16.521 --> 00:29:19.958
And a few more people
decided to join.

00:29:21.326 --> 00:29:22.327
I see.

00:29:26.264 --> 00:29:28.900
This is the actual project proposal.

00:29:29.033 --> 00:29:31.035
Seeing the World Through Textbooks

00:29:33.872 --> 00:29:35.240
This is a great theme.

00:29:35.840 --> 00:29:38.076
"Seeing the World Through Textbooks."

00:29:39.110 --> 00:29:40.345
I like it.

00:29:45.416 --> 00:29:48.253
Kurayoshi's words
made me realize something.

00:29:50.088 --> 00:29:54.659
Japanese people tend to
blur their themes too quickly.

00:29:56.261 --> 00:30:00.765
But themes are meant to be
something you always return to.

00:30:01.065 --> 00:30:03.034
Like "The Zest for Life."

00:30:03.368 --> 00:30:04.369
Yes.

00:30:05.370 --> 00:30:07.872
If that's a pillar of
the curriculum guidelines

00:30:08.473 --> 00:30:10.775
then the entire content
should be restructured.

00:30:11.109 --> 00:30:12.677
That's how heavy a concept it is.

00:30:13.945 --> 00:30:18.883
But instead, they just
patch things together

00:30:19.584 --> 00:30:21.152
which makes everything inconsistent.

00:30:22.520 --> 00:30:23.588
That's a harsh truth.

00:30:24.522 --> 00:30:26.391
I'd love for the
Ministry of Education to hear this.

00:30:27.592 --> 00:30:31.029
I'm determined to make sure
it doesn't happen again.

00:30:33.464 --> 00:30:35.400
Here's the progress plan.

00:30:35.466 --> 00:30:36.768
Could you review it?

00:30:36.868 --> 00:30:37.869
Sure.

00:30:37.969 --> 00:30:39.370
Progress Plan

00:30:40.271 --> 00:30:42.974
It's a good idea.

00:30:44.809 --> 00:30:48.012
But if it were me...

00:30:56.020 --> 00:30:57.288
I'd do it like this instead.

00:31:04.963 --> 00:31:08.766
Mr. Mikami,
lure the rat into the trap.

00:31:09.901 --> 00:31:10.902
Got it.

00:31:13.771 --> 00:31:15.206
The Day Before the Rintoku Festival

00:31:15.306 --> 00:31:17.141
– Is over here okay?
– Yeah, put it there.

00:31:23.481 --> 00:31:26.017
– Can I help?
– Of course!

00:31:26.251 --> 00:31:31.489
Tokyo Detention Center
Visitation Entrance

00:31:41.799 --> 00:31:43.601
Number 133.

00:31:46.170 --> 00:31:47.171
Yes.

00:31:48.373 --> 00:31:50.608
Mayama Yuzuru has refused the visit.

00:31:56.581 --> 00:31:59.284
What should I do?

00:31:59.450 --> 00:32:02.020
The only way is to
confirm her intentions by letter.

00:32:20.271 --> 00:32:23.007
Are you able to meet with her?

00:32:33.518 --> 00:32:35.787
You had to move, didn't you?

00:32:36.821 --> 00:32:37.889
It's fine.

00:32:38.356 --> 00:32:41.659
I was planning to
move closer to here anyway.

00:32:45.697 --> 00:32:47.665
I told you to forget about it,
didn't I?

00:32:51.102 --> 00:32:52.637
I can't. That's why I'm struggling.

00:33:00.311 --> 00:33:04.649
I turned 18 yesterday.

00:33:10.121 --> 00:33:11.222
I see.

00:33:13.057 --> 00:33:15.293
No wonder your face is
starting to look more grown-up.

00:33:28.439 --> 00:33:31.642
Yuzuru killed someone.

00:33:37.782 --> 00:33:41.886
But in a way, so did I.

00:33:43.154 --> 00:33:48.693
I used words
to kill someone's spirit.

00:33:53.931 --> 00:33:58.036
I can't just forget that
and move on with my life.

00:34:02.206 --> 00:34:04.809
– Please tell me the truth.
– There is no truth!

00:34:08.179 --> 00:34:09.247
There is.

00:34:10.415 --> 00:34:11.616
You're just hiding it.

00:34:43.648 --> 00:34:44.649
Wow.

00:34:46.751 --> 00:34:48.486
"Textbooks of the World"?

00:35:02.033 --> 00:35:04.602
Well, this should be fine.

00:35:05.503 --> 00:35:07.071
Principal, let's move on.

00:35:10.675 --> 00:35:12.310
– I'll go watch them.
– Go for it.

00:35:18.683 --> 00:35:19.684
Well?

00:35:21.152 --> 00:35:22.620
– They're gone!
– All right!

00:35:24.155 --> 00:35:29.093
Now, let's activate Plan Okami.

00:35:29.260 --> 00:35:30.294
– Let's go!
– Yeah!

00:35:31.129 --> 00:35:32.296
Plan Okami?

00:35:32.697 --> 00:35:34.198
Yes.

00:35:35.032 --> 00:35:36.801
The students are working
really hard on it.

00:35:39.604 --> 00:35:41.305
He is really loved, isn't he?

00:35:41.806 --> 00:35:43.107
I agree.

00:35:45.076 --> 00:35:48.813
He is loved.
Frustrating as it is to admit.

00:36:04.128 --> 00:36:06.297
Mayama Yuzuru

00:36:14.939 --> 00:36:16.641
The Day of Rintoku Festival

00:36:16.741 --> 00:36:18.142
It's Mizohata.

00:36:18.242 --> 00:36:19.343
Everything's fine.

00:36:31.155 --> 00:36:33.291
What? Oh, crap!

00:36:47.171 --> 00:36:49.307
Mr. Mizohata,
I didn't realize you were here.

00:36:50.341 --> 00:36:51.976
– Mr. Mikami.
– Yes?

00:36:53.544 --> 00:36:55.980
Deputy Minister Takizawa
is very busy today

00:36:56.681 --> 00:36:58.816
so I'd like for you
not to meet with him.

00:36:58.916 --> 00:37:00.184
Understood.

00:37:04.956 --> 00:37:07.458
Today, we welcome
Mr. Takizawa Yuichiro

00:37:07.858 --> 00:37:11.462
the Deputy Minister of Education,
for a site visit!

00:37:14.232 --> 00:37:18.970
First of all, congratulations on
today's Rintoku Festival.

00:37:20.037 --> 00:37:23.307
This cultural festival,
despite being a high school event

00:37:23.374 --> 00:37:25.810
had demonstrated
remarkable creativity

00:37:25.876 --> 00:37:27.511
and is well-loved
by the local community...

00:37:27.612 --> 00:37:31.382
Wow, Plan Okami is a huge success.

00:37:31.649 --> 00:37:32.750
Of course!

00:37:32.817 --> 00:37:35.987
We knew Mizohata would definitely
do another check in the morning.

00:37:40.124 --> 00:37:41.125
Hi!

00:37:41.759 --> 00:37:43.828
Dad, you made it.

00:37:43.928 --> 00:37:45.896
The hospital finally
approved my leave.

00:37:47.331 --> 00:37:48.666
Thank you.

00:37:48.766 --> 00:37:50.935
He seemed really excited about it.

00:37:53.437 --> 00:37:58.009
I'd like you and Mr. Mikami
to be the first to see it.

00:37:59.110 --> 00:38:00.144
Everything here was handmade?

00:38:00.244 --> 00:38:02.346
– Yes, that's right.
– That's amazing!

00:38:02.446 --> 00:38:05.283
Everyone lined up from
early in the morning.

00:38:06.584 --> 00:38:08.686
A school so deeply connected
with the local community

00:38:08.786 --> 00:38:10.454
has always been my ideal.

00:38:11.789 --> 00:38:12.823
Right.

00:38:12.890 --> 00:38:15.192
Mikami is here at Rintoku, isn't he?

00:38:16.027 --> 00:38:18.663
Seniors here usually
don't participate,

00:38:18.763 --> 00:38:21.198
but his class insisted on joining.

00:38:21.299 --> 00:38:23.234
What's their exhibit about?

00:38:24.335 --> 00:38:26.103
"Textbook of the World," apparently.

00:38:26.203 --> 00:38:28.973
Is that so? That I have to see!

00:38:29.774 --> 00:38:31.075
That was amazing!

00:38:31.409 --> 00:38:33.744
Wow, look at this crowd!

00:38:34.445 --> 00:38:37.581
Wakui is a well-known
quiz influencer

00:38:37.848 --> 00:38:39.317
so he spread the word.

00:38:39.817 --> 00:38:41.619
Now the school can't stop us.

00:38:41.786 --> 00:38:43.587
Mr. Mikami!

00:38:43.688 --> 00:38:44.689
Yes?

00:38:44.989 --> 00:38:46.123
Deputy Minister Takizawa
is coming here.

00:38:46.223 --> 00:38:47.425
I'm truly surprised.

00:38:47.491 --> 00:38:50.961
I never imagined there was a way
to demonstrate textbook screening.

00:38:51.996 --> 00:38:54.165
Wait, textbook screening?

00:38:54.265 --> 00:38:56.100
Textbook screening is
explained very well here.

00:38:56.200 --> 00:38:57.768
Let me introduce you to everyone.

00:39:01.339 --> 00:39:02.973
Mr. Mikami, we need to
temporarily suspend this exhibit--

00:39:03.074 --> 00:39:04.542
I don't think that's possible.

00:39:07.812 --> 00:39:09.680
We sincerely apologize.

00:39:10.114 --> 00:39:11.215
There's been a technical issue

00:39:11.315 --> 00:39:12.950
so we need to
pause this exhibit for now...

00:39:13.050 --> 00:39:15.086
The issue has been fixed!

00:39:15.186 --> 00:39:16.187
You!

00:39:18.522 --> 00:39:19.590
Mikami!

00:39:19.924 --> 00:39:22.660
Deputy Minister Takizawa,
it's been a while.

00:39:22.893 --> 00:39:24.495
I heard you were at Rintoku

00:39:24.562 --> 00:39:26.163
so I was looking forward to
seeing you.

00:39:26.263 --> 00:39:29.367
Yes, I've been fully immersed
in the atmosphere here.

00:39:29.467 --> 00:39:30.768
I'm very grateful, sir.

00:39:31.102 --> 00:39:32.503
Is that so?

00:39:32.603 --> 00:39:34.338
Well then, keep up the good work.

00:39:34.438 --> 00:39:35.439
Thank you, sir.

00:39:35.539 --> 00:39:37.041
Deputy Minister, it's time for
your next appointment.

00:39:37.141 --> 00:39:38.843
If you'd like, please take a look
before you leave.

00:39:38.943 --> 00:39:40.511
Makino, how is he on time?

00:39:43.180 --> 00:39:44.281
A minute or two should be fine.

00:39:44.448 --> 00:39:46.117
Then, right this way.

00:39:47.051 --> 00:39:48.152
Excuse me.

00:39:53.524 --> 00:39:54.625
Hello.

00:40:07.438 --> 00:40:08.572
Wow.

00:40:18.749 --> 00:40:20.151
Textbook Screening.

00:40:21.051 --> 00:40:23.320
Do you know this term?

00:40:25.289 --> 00:40:27.291
What is this about?

00:40:30.194 --> 00:40:32.596
– Would you like to leave, sir?
– No.

00:40:37.902 --> 00:40:39.537
Textbook screening
refers to the process

00:40:40.137 --> 00:40:42.273
conducted by
the Ministry of Education...

00:40:42.373 --> 00:40:43.441
What is this?

00:40:43.541 --> 00:40:45.142
...where privately published
textbooks are reviewed...

00:40:45.242 --> 00:40:46.243
Well...

00:40:46.343 --> 00:40:48.479
...to determine if
their content is appropriate

00:40:48.579 --> 00:40:50.948
and align with the curriculum
guidelines before they are issued.

00:40:53.050 --> 00:40:56.487
Is textbook screening necessary?

00:41:01.192 --> 00:41:02.226
Of course it is.

00:41:02.293 --> 00:41:03.294
Right, Deputy Minister?

00:41:09.533 --> 00:41:12.403
Countries and Regions
Where Textbook Screening Exists

00:41:16.941 --> 00:41:18.676
Sir!

00:41:19.310 --> 00:41:20.478
Excuse me.

00:41:22.513 --> 00:41:23.948
I'm Kanzaki from the journalism club.

00:41:25.816 --> 00:41:26.817
What are your thoughts
on this exhibit?

00:41:26.917 --> 00:41:29.320
– Kanzaki...
– No, I don't mind.

00:41:31.822 --> 00:41:33.724
– I'd like to hear your thoughts.
– Kanzaki!

00:41:33.824 --> 00:41:35.392
I'm asking the Deputy Minister.

00:41:48.405 --> 00:41:49.573
Would you mind answering?

00:41:51.509 --> 00:41:54.612
Other than the content,
the use of digital technology

00:41:54.912 --> 00:41:57.381
and the event-like
presentation method

00:41:57.748 --> 00:41:59.650
left a strong impression on me.

00:41:59.984 --> 00:42:02.186
And the students'...

00:42:02.286 --> 00:42:03.687
What are you thinking?

00:42:03.787 --> 00:42:07.324
Their creativity and passion...

00:42:07.424 --> 00:42:09.627
What is going on, Mr. Mikami?

00:42:09.727 --> 00:42:13.097
I apologize. I wasn't
fully aware of the content.

00:42:13.197 --> 00:42:14.431
This is an educational institution.

00:42:14.532 --> 00:42:16.467
Please refrain from using
bureaucratic rhetoric!

00:42:16.800 --> 00:42:19.870
– What is this?
– Wait, this came before, right?

00:42:21.305 --> 00:42:22.940
Excuse me, look at this.

00:42:26.544 --> 00:42:29.513
"I am the one who brings down
the Kusanagi sword

00:42:29.613 --> 00:42:32.216
upon those who enter
through the Hirakawa Gate.

00:42:33.083 --> 00:42:36.720
Your injustice will soon be exposed
to the light of day.

00:42:37.321 --> 00:42:39.189
Signed, Prince Yamato Takeru."

00:42:51.135 --> 00:42:53.270
Okami, everyone's waiting.

00:42:53.537 --> 00:42:54.538
Okay.

00:42:55.439 --> 00:42:56.640
May I be excused?

00:42:57.875 --> 00:42:58.876
Go ahead.

00:43:01.912 --> 00:43:02.947
Hurry up!

00:43:06.817 --> 00:43:08.919
Thank you so much!

00:43:09.753 --> 00:43:10.821
Cheers!

00:43:10.888 --> 00:43:13.524
– Cheers!
– Cheers!

00:43:14.024 --> 00:43:15.826
– Good job, everyone!
– Cheers!

00:43:16.660 --> 00:43:19.296
– Cheers!
– Cheers!

00:43:23.601 --> 00:43:24.935
– Mr. Mikami.
– Yes?

00:43:25.703 --> 00:43:28.806
– I think I understand now.
– What?

00:43:29.840 --> 00:43:31.442
"The personal is political."

00:43:32.643 --> 00:43:35.713
What's personal is also political.

00:43:36.981 --> 00:43:38.015
That's right.

00:43:39.249 --> 00:43:44.588
Maybe that's why the curriculum
also needs to protect family peace.

00:43:48.125 --> 00:43:50.661
Incoming Call
Makino

00:43:53.530 --> 00:43:55.132
Good job on the festival.

00:43:55.399 --> 00:43:56.834
Good job on the inspection.

00:43:57.901 --> 00:43:59.470
There's something I need to tell you.

00:44:00.437 --> 00:44:03.107
Since you've thrown yourself into
the heart of educational reform

00:44:03.207 --> 00:44:04.375
do whatever you like.

00:44:04.475 --> 00:44:07.244
But touching on textbook screening
was a bit reckless.

00:44:07.344 --> 00:44:08.812
Don't you agree?

00:44:10.014 --> 00:44:11.148
What's the problem?

00:44:11.548 --> 00:44:14.151
Isn't it obvious? The fact that
the Deputy Minister was there!

00:44:14.785 --> 00:44:16.687
Since the establishment of
the Cabinet Personnel Bureau

00:44:16.787 --> 00:44:18.656
Nagatacho has had control
over bureaucratic appointments.

00:44:18.922 --> 00:44:20.324
You should know that, Mikami.

00:44:20.724 --> 00:44:21.959
Is that a threat?

00:44:22.059 --> 00:44:23.794
Come on, of course not.

00:44:25.629 --> 00:44:26.797
Do whatever you want.

00:44:27.931 --> 00:44:30.234
But if you involve my students,
I won't forgive you.

00:44:39.777 --> 00:44:41.178
You heard that.

00:44:42.613 --> 00:44:44.581
What's going on with Mikami?

00:44:45.182 --> 00:44:48.185
You should be careful,
or you might get taken down.

00:44:49.219 --> 00:44:51.522
Still, this is bad, Makino.

00:44:51.989 --> 00:44:54.324
I didn't say
you could bring up personnel matters.

00:44:54.858 --> 00:44:58.729
But we got played.
We were used.

00:44:58.829 --> 00:45:01.799
No, it's also partially your fault
for not being able to stop it.

00:45:03.901 --> 00:45:07.404
Yes, and that's why
I won't let this slide.

00:45:08.105 --> 00:45:09.940
I won't let Mikami
do whatever he wants.

00:45:10.007 --> 00:45:11.075
Is that okay, sir?

00:45:14.978 --> 00:45:16.180
Do as you please.

00:45:33.864 --> 00:45:36.934
If I don't do it,
I won't be myself anymore.

00:45:41.805 --> 00:45:44.174
Being betrayed by your mother,
the one person you believed in.

00:45:44.274 --> 00:45:45.943
Then constantly being
berated by your father.

00:45:46.043 --> 00:45:47.344
There's no way it wasn't painful.

00:45:47.444 --> 00:45:49.913
It's ultimately just
prioritizing our own gain.

00:45:50.013 --> 00:45:51.648
It's something
we should dedicate our lives to.

00:45:51.749 --> 00:45:54.985
Team Mikami might say something
to challenge the government.

00:45:55.085 --> 00:45:57.755
It will skyrocket
Rintoku's reputation.

00:45:57.855 --> 00:45:59.356
It was Mikami's idea, right?

00:45:59.456 --> 00:46:01.925
This seems like it might
come in handy in a pinch.

00:46:02.025 --> 00:46:04.862
You, me, we're both guilty!
