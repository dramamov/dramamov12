WEBVTT

00:00:58.191 --> 00:00:59.192
Mitsuhiro.

00:01:02.495 --> 00:01:03.496
Welcome back.

00:01:08.968 --> 00:01:10.203
"Welcome back"?

00:01:13.306 --> 00:01:14.307
I'm back.

00:01:16.309 --> 00:01:17.977
That's not what I meant.

00:01:28.788 --> 00:01:30.223
What were you doing until now?

00:01:33.493 --> 00:01:34.661
Where were you?

00:01:38.965 --> 00:01:40.033
Answer me.

00:01:50.743 --> 00:01:51.744
Was it Yurika?

00:01:58.718 --> 00:01:59.853
Your affair.

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:04.491
It was Yurika, right?

00:02:07.894 --> 00:02:09.562
No, it wasn't.

00:02:12.432 --> 00:02:13.433
You're wrong.

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:16.469
It really wasn't Yurika.

00:02:18.371 --> 00:02:20.673
I swear to God it wasn't.

00:02:22.876 --> 00:02:23.877
Then...

00:02:27.247 --> 00:02:28.882
I met her while gaming.

00:02:32.585 --> 00:02:33.586
Gaming?

00:02:37.023 --> 00:02:40.527
I'm sorry,
but I broke things off with her.

00:02:42.195 --> 00:02:45.165
I know that's not enough
for you to forgive me.

00:02:46.166 --> 00:02:49.035
I know saying sorry
won't be enough either.

00:02:50.537 --> 00:02:51.771
But I mean it.

00:02:56.910 --> 00:02:57.911
I'm sorry.

00:02:58.912 --> 00:02:59.913
I'm really sorry.

00:03:08.154 --> 00:03:10.490
I was wrong.

00:03:12.759 --> 00:03:16.629
Not just about this,
but even before this all happened.

00:03:18.531 --> 00:03:19.532
What?

00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:21.701
I was trying to avoid

00:03:23.469 --> 00:03:25.238
meeting you head-on.

00:03:27.740 --> 00:03:31.044
I finally realized
after my time away from you...

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:35.715
that I can't keep being like this.

00:03:36.549 --> 00:03:38.518
So, that's why...

00:03:41.988 --> 00:03:42.989
I came back.

00:03:46.326 --> 00:03:47.727
I know I'm being selfish.

00:03:49.095 --> 00:03:50.296
But could we...

00:03:54.234 --> 00:03:55.902
give this another chance?

00:04:20.360 --> 00:04:21.394
What are you doing?

00:04:25.498 --> 00:04:26.499
Again?

00:04:43.583 --> 00:04:44.617
Ms. Sakaki?

00:04:45.051 --> 00:04:47.287
Open up, it's the police!

00:04:48.921 --> 00:04:50.189
Ms. Sakaki!

00:06:26.552 --> 00:06:29.455
PLEASE DIE MY BELOVED

00:06:49.208 --> 00:06:50.410
But could we

00:06:51.277 --> 00:06:52.912
give this another chance?

00:07:03.890 --> 00:07:05.992
RIKO

00:07:08.628 --> 00:07:09.629
What is it, Riko?

00:07:12.598 --> 00:07:13.599
What?

00:07:23.342 --> 00:07:25.511
KEEP OUT

00:07:28.314 --> 00:07:29.315
Maya?

00:07:30.650 --> 00:07:31.651
Riko!

00:07:32.051 --> 00:07:33.920
- What's going on?
- I don't know.

00:07:34.120 --> 00:07:35.755
But this morning

00:07:36.522 --> 00:07:37.523
I saw this.

00:07:37.824 --> 00:07:39.792
She really might've done it herself.

00:07:43.963 --> 00:07:47.200
MANAGEMENT COMPANY

00:07:47.266 --> 00:07:48.267
Mr. Shimura.

00:07:49.535 --> 00:07:50.703
What brings you here?

00:07:52.505 --> 00:07:53.506
I was worried

00:07:54.674 --> 00:07:56.742
about my friend, Yurika.

00:07:58.411 --> 00:07:59.412
I'm Shimura.

00:08:01.280 --> 00:08:02.715
What happened?

00:08:04.150 --> 00:08:07.086
Hello, I'm Kakihara.
Criminal Investigation Section.

00:08:07.820 --> 00:08:09.589
Are you Yurika Sakaki's friends?

00:08:10.323 --> 00:08:11.524
- Yes.
- Yes.

00:08:11.991 --> 00:08:13.493
May we ask some questions?

00:08:16.529 --> 00:08:17.530
Thank you.

00:08:25.371 --> 00:08:26.572
Was Ms. Sakaki

00:08:27.206 --> 00:08:30.576
experiencing issues
in her married life?

00:08:32.945 --> 00:08:33.946
No.

00:08:38.251 --> 00:08:39.252
Really?

00:08:41.153 --> 00:08:42.154
Yes.

00:08:43.956 --> 00:08:47.326
Has she ever asked you
for advice about her husband?

00:08:50.696 --> 00:08:51.998
No, never.

00:08:54.200 --> 00:08:55.368
I see.

00:08:57.770 --> 00:09:00.806
What happened to Yurika?

00:09:03.409 --> 00:09:04.744
Tetsuya Sakaki confessed

00:09:05.044 --> 00:09:08.114
that he assaulted Yurika
after an argument.

00:09:13.219 --> 00:09:15.154
- I'm sorry.
- What?!

00:09:16.155 --> 00:09:17.490
You've got it all wrong!

00:09:18.591 --> 00:09:19.592
She...

00:09:20.760 --> 00:09:23.129
She wouldn't do as I said.

00:09:26.866 --> 00:09:28.768
I wasn't trying to kill her.

00:09:32.138 --> 00:09:33.139
Again?

00:09:40.613 --> 00:09:44.350
Did you really think
you could kill me?

00:09:45.551 --> 00:09:48.087
I didn't think you were that dumb.

00:09:50.456 --> 00:09:52.792
- Not as dumb as you.
- What?

00:09:54.260 --> 00:09:58.030
There isn't a person on Earth
who is as dumb as you!

00:09:58.331 --> 00:09:59.765
You asshole!

00:10:08.674 --> 00:10:09.675
Hey.

00:10:10.076 --> 00:10:11.310
Get up already.

00:10:12.345 --> 00:10:13.346
Hey!

00:10:19.051 --> 00:10:20.052
Yurika.

00:10:21.887 --> 00:10:22.888
Hey!

00:10:23.623 --> 00:10:24.624
Wake up!

00:10:25.424 --> 00:10:27.760
Yurika, wake up!

00:10:28.828 --> 00:10:29.829
Hey!

00:10:30.096 --> 00:10:31.097
Yurika!

00:10:31.530 --> 00:10:32.531
Wake up.

00:10:35.301 --> 00:10:37.136
Is Yurika okay?

00:10:39.472 --> 00:10:41.207
Her life is not in danger.

00:10:42.441 --> 00:10:44.510
Really? Thank goodness.

00:10:45.177 --> 00:10:46.178
But...

00:10:49.048 --> 00:10:50.783
It seems she's still unconscious.

00:11:04.130 --> 00:11:06.232
You must be worried
about your friend.

00:11:06.799 --> 00:11:07.800
Mr. Shimura.

00:11:08.968 --> 00:11:11.671
She wasn't the affair.

00:11:12.938 --> 00:11:16.208
The oden restaurant saw the photo
and said it wasn't her.

00:11:18.844 --> 00:11:19.912
Well...

00:11:21.247 --> 00:11:22.248
Actually...

00:11:24.750 --> 00:11:26.452
I apologize for the inconvenience.

00:11:26.786 --> 00:11:27.887
I'm sorry.

00:11:28.954 --> 00:11:30.456
We're glad you're safe.

00:11:31.424 --> 00:11:32.792
Thank you.

00:11:34.527 --> 00:11:35.661
Why did you disappear?

00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:42.802
She found out about my affair

00:11:43.235 --> 00:11:45.871
so I ran away to avoid facing her.

00:11:48.040 --> 00:11:51.143
Why did you try
to deceive her afterward?

00:11:52.011 --> 00:11:53.145
Because...

00:11:55.948 --> 00:11:57.850
I resented her for resenting me.

00:12:00.386 --> 00:12:01.387
TO MAYA

00:12:01.454 --> 00:12:02.988
I was retaliating

00:12:03.322 --> 00:12:05.991
since she got mad at me.

00:12:10.963 --> 00:12:14.033
It was fun at first, like a prank.

00:12:14.366 --> 00:12:15.367
But...

00:12:17.269 --> 00:12:19.105
But I realized

00:12:20.406 --> 00:12:21.907
that our relationship

00:12:22.708 --> 00:12:26.112
went astray
because I had been acting like this.

00:12:27.513 --> 00:12:29.315
I always blamed Maya

00:12:29.915 --> 00:12:32.918
and didn't realize
something so simple.

00:12:34.086 --> 00:12:35.287
I'm embarrassed.

00:12:37.323 --> 00:12:38.491
I'm really sorry.

00:12:41.260 --> 00:12:42.261
I'm sorry.

00:12:46.632 --> 00:12:47.633
I'll change.

00:12:48.434 --> 00:12:49.602
I promise I'll change.

00:12:50.803 --> 00:12:53.439
So please give me another chance.

00:12:58.944 --> 00:13:01.480
Can you finish this at home?

00:13:03.816 --> 00:13:05.217
- I'm sorry.
- I'm sorry.

00:13:05.651 --> 00:13:07.486
Okay, we'll walk you out.

00:13:11.123 --> 00:13:18.130
KAJIWARA POLICE DEPARTMENT

00:13:18.831 --> 00:13:21.233
- Thank you.
- I'm sorry for the trouble.

00:13:28.607 --> 00:13:29.675
Good grief.

00:13:29.809 --> 00:13:32.144
That intuition of yours
really messed with us.

00:13:33.345 --> 00:13:34.380
I'm sorry about that.

00:13:35.648 --> 00:13:37.183
I guess I'm at that age.

00:13:38.584 --> 00:13:39.585
I guess so.

00:13:41.620 --> 00:13:44.390
I'm sorry
for getting you scolded, too.

00:13:50.663 --> 00:13:51.664
Are you hungry?

00:13:52.832 --> 00:13:54.266
Want to eat something?

00:13:55.334 --> 00:13:57.336
I wonder what's around here.

00:13:58.904 --> 00:14:00.239
Or we can eat at home.

00:14:02.007 --> 00:14:03.008
Maya?

00:14:07.213 --> 00:14:08.214
I'm sorry.

00:14:09.448 --> 00:14:10.449
What?

00:14:13.185 --> 00:14:14.186
I...

00:14:16.522 --> 00:14:18.424
was always blaming you.

00:14:20.059 --> 00:14:21.060
I'm sorry.

00:14:22.428 --> 00:14:23.429
Maya.

00:14:28.167 --> 00:14:29.168
Thank you.

00:14:30.936 --> 00:14:31.937
What?

00:14:33.072 --> 00:14:35.007
For feeling that way

00:14:35.407 --> 00:14:36.642
and for apologizing.

00:14:38.844 --> 00:14:39.845
Thank you.

00:15:20.019 --> 00:15:23.322
Headed to work. Mitsuhiro

00:15:27.192 --> 00:15:28.627
I know I'm being selfish.

00:15:29.561 --> 00:15:31.096
But could we

00:15:31.764 --> 00:15:33.465
give this another chance?

00:15:34.500 --> 00:15:35.501
I'll change.

00:15:36.302 --> 00:15:37.569
I promise I'll change.

00:15:38.570 --> 00:15:41.273
So please give me another chance.

00:15:50.282 --> 00:15:52.451
Everyone here? Let's begin.

00:15:53.485 --> 00:15:54.820
Can I start?

00:15:55.888 --> 00:15:56.922
Yes, go ahead.

00:15:59.325 --> 00:16:02.227
This is a bit personal,
but I got divorced last month.

00:16:04.296 --> 00:16:07.900
I'll be raising my son
as a single mom from now on

00:16:08.067 --> 00:16:09.435
so my work style will change.

00:16:10.002 --> 00:16:12.604
Of course,
this won't affect my duties.

00:16:14.139 --> 00:16:17.609
I'm saying this
to avoid any strange rumors

00:16:17.810 --> 00:16:19.011
or misunderstandings.

00:16:20.045 --> 00:16:21.046
That is all.

00:16:25.751 --> 00:16:27.252
Right, well...

00:16:27.319 --> 00:16:30.956
Oh, right, Torii, progress report.

00:16:31.457 --> 00:16:32.458
Okay.

00:16:34.593 --> 00:16:36.228
For Lifestyle Sales

00:16:36.395 --> 00:16:38.897
we've decided on the fragrance
for each floor

00:16:38.964 --> 00:16:41.100
and are looking into companies
to collaborate with.

00:16:44.036 --> 00:16:46.505
That's all for this meeting.
Thank you.

00:16:52.244 --> 00:16:53.245
Ms. Tachibana.

00:16:59.284 --> 00:17:00.452
I was surprised.

00:17:02.855 --> 00:17:03.856
Was this also...

00:17:05.891 --> 00:17:07.993
in the life you planned?

00:17:12.898 --> 00:17:13.899
Of course not.

00:17:15.868 --> 00:17:16.902
This wasn't planned.

00:17:18.237 --> 00:17:20.272
My plans for old age
are in shambles, too.

00:17:24.910 --> 00:17:27.046
Divorce was our only option.

00:17:30.916 --> 00:17:31.917
Why?

00:17:36.288 --> 00:17:37.322
It was my fault.

00:17:40.559 --> 00:17:42.294
By the time I tried to face him

00:17:43.295 --> 00:17:44.630
it was too late.

00:17:51.270 --> 00:17:52.337
Honestly

00:17:54.239 --> 00:17:55.240
I regret it.

00:18:07.586 --> 00:18:08.587
RYOSUKE

00:18:08.654 --> 00:18:11.957
We feel the same way
about this, right?

00:18:15.594 --> 00:18:16.595
Who is it?

00:18:19.398 --> 00:18:21.033
Who are you texting?

00:18:26.138 --> 00:18:27.139
I'm sorry.

00:18:28.107 --> 00:18:29.108
Forget I asked.

00:18:54.366 --> 00:18:55.667
How are you feeling?

00:18:56.368 --> 00:18:58.003
Are you eating properly?

00:18:58.403 --> 00:18:59.404
Yes.

00:19:00.506 --> 00:19:04.042
We got a clear reading
of your baby's heartbeat.

00:19:05.344 --> 00:19:06.345
Here.

00:19:08.981 --> 00:19:12.050
We can see its head, hands,
and feet more clearly now.

00:19:56.195 --> 00:19:57.429
Did you make a decision?

00:20:02.701 --> 00:20:04.036
We'll live as a family of two.

00:20:06.872 --> 00:20:07.873
Yes.

00:20:09.641 --> 00:20:10.642
Thank you.

00:20:12.077 --> 00:20:14.079
I knew we felt the same way.

00:20:15.214 --> 00:20:16.215
Me and the baby.

00:20:18.884 --> 00:20:19.885
What?

00:20:25.791 --> 00:20:26.792
The baby and I

00:20:28.026 --> 00:20:29.294
will live together.

00:20:32.898 --> 00:20:35.067
What are you talking about, Riko?

00:20:42.241 --> 00:20:43.442
Let's go to the hospital.

00:20:43.575 --> 00:20:44.710
I'll talk to them.

00:20:44.910 --> 00:20:45.911
Stop.

00:20:47.279 --> 00:20:48.280
Riko.

00:20:50.482 --> 00:20:54.453
I can't be with someone
who doesn't accept this baby.

00:20:57.089 --> 00:20:58.090
I won't.

00:20:59.958 --> 00:21:00.959
Riko.

00:21:03.962 --> 00:21:04.963
Farewell.

00:21:16.408 --> 00:21:17.442
Mom.

00:21:18.076 --> 00:21:19.177
Mom!

00:21:21.013 --> 00:21:23.515
Mom, wake up.

00:21:24.916 --> 00:21:28.453
I want to talk to you, Mom.

00:21:29.721 --> 00:21:32.024
I miss your food, Mom.

00:21:32.391 --> 00:21:34.526
Let's go home together.

00:21:35.160 --> 00:21:36.261
Mom.

00:21:43.168 --> 00:21:45.203
Are you okay, Yuna?

00:22:03.689 --> 00:22:04.756
Yuna?

00:22:06.358 --> 00:22:08.126
- Mom.
- Yurika.

00:22:08.627 --> 00:22:09.628
Yurika!

00:22:10.462 --> 00:22:11.697
You're awake!

00:22:11.997 --> 00:22:13.065
Mom!

00:22:13.999 --> 00:22:15.000
Yuna.

00:22:17.235 --> 00:22:18.337
Mom!

00:22:18.770 --> 00:22:19.905
Mom!

00:22:21.973 --> 00:22:23.108
Yuna.

00:22:24.776 --> 00:22:26.044
Are you okay?

00:22:30.015 --> 00:22:33.552
Yurika, I was so worried about you!

00:22:33.719 --> 00:22:36.388
- I'm sorry.
- Thank goodness.

00:22:36.955 --> 00:22:38.123
I'm so relieved.

00:22:38.824 --> 00:22:40.625
We put you through too much.

00:22:43.195 --> 00:22:45.364
It's my fault. I'm sorry.

00:22:48.567 --> 00:22:51.436
Well, he got arrested

00:22:51.937 --> 00:22:54.306
so the result is pretty all right.

00:22:55.040 --> 00:22:56.441
Gosh, Yurika.

00:22:58.076 --> 00:23:02.381
But I can't believe you thought
I was the one Mitsuhiro cheated with.

00:23:03.782 --> 00:23:04.916
I'm really sorry.

00:23:05.784 --> 00:23:08.086
I was crazy to suspect you.

00:23:08.854 --> 00:23:09.988
I'm the worst.

00:23:10.389 --> 00:23:14.059
No, you were going
through a lot, too.

00:23:19.731 --> 00:23:24.269
Hey, there's just one thing
that's been bothering me.

00:23:24.936 --> 00:23:25.937
Can I ask?

00:23:26.705 --> 00:23:27.706
Yes.

00:23:28.874 --> 00:23:32.411
Remember
when we had that fight earlier?

00:23:33.712 --> 00:23:39.251
That night, you made it sound
like you had met with Mitsuhiro.

00:23:40.318 --> 00:23:41.787
What was that about?

00:23:44.222 --> 00:23:45.891
Even Mitsuhiro was struggling.

00:23:46.191 --> 00:23:47.926
It was all over his face.

00:23:48.093 --> 00:23:50.829
You could tell from his face
that he didn't want to go home.

00:23:51.363 --> 00:23:52.364
That was...

00:23:52.831 --> 00:23:55.000
Maya, maybe now is not the best time.

00:23:55.901 --> 00:23:56.902
I'm sorry.

00:23:58.170 --> 00:23:59.171
It's okay.

00:24:00.605 --> 00:24:01.907
It was just once.

00:24:02.808 --> 00:24:06.478
I happened to see Mitsuhiro
at the park.

00:24:15.987 --> 00:24:20.525
I couldn't call out to him
since he looked so depressed.

00:24:26.565 --> 00:24:27.766
I see.

00:24:30.902 --> 00:24:32.804
I'm sorry,
it was an odd thing to say.

00:24:36.942 --> 00:24:38.810
Everything is resolved then.

00:24:39.511 --> 00:24:40.512
Right?

00:24:41.413 --> 00:24:42.414
Yes.

00:24:43.181 --> 00:24:47.986
After all,
our friendship is not that fragile.

00:25:46.177 --> 00:25:47.178
I'm home.

00:25:48.079 --> 00:25:49.080
Welcome back.

00:25:53.818 --> 00:25:54.819
That's...

00:25:54.986 --> 00:25:56.154
Yes.

00:25:56.488 --> 00:25:59.190
I found it in the closet.

00:26:00.992 --> 00:26:02.193
You should wash your hands.

00:26:03.795 --> 00:26:05.030
Dinner's ready.

00:26:05.630 --> 00:26:06.765
It's simple, though.

00:26:07.699 --> 00:26:08.700
Let's eat.

00:26:11.269 --> 00:26:13.038
- Thank you.
- Yes.

00:26:22.414 --> 00:26:23.415
Mitsuhiro.

00:26:24.382 --> 00:26:25.383
Yes?

00:26:28.320 --> 00:26:30.288
I'll change, too.

00:26:32.090 --> 00:26:33.091
What?

00:26:34.326 --> 00:26:35.327
I decided

00:26:37.128 --> 00:26:38.396
to change, too.

00:26:40.865 --> 00:26:41.866
Maya.

00:26:59.684 --> 00:27:00.685
Mr. Kagami.

00:27:11.062 --> 00:27:12.063
Hey!

00:27:13.098 --> 00:27:14.165
Running away?

00:27:26.378 --> 00:27:29.414
You're always running away,
aren't you?

00:27:33.585 --> 00:27:37.856
From the reality
that Riko is holding my baby.

00:27:42.494 --> 00:27:43.762
I'm the dad!

00:27:44.396 --> 00:27:45.397
Not you!

00:27:49.367 --> 00:27:51.236
Riko will see it grow up
to look like me.

00:27:54.172 --> 00:27:55.573
And she'll live her life

00:27:57.142 --> 00:27:58.576
remembering me.

00:27:59.511 --> 00:28:00.612
For the rest of her life.

00:28:03.782 --> 00:28:05.083
Can you endure that?

00:28:08.386 --> 00:28:09.721
That's not for you to decide.

00:28:12.290 --> 00:28:13.291
What?

00:28:24.769 --> 00:28:29.274
You don't get to decide
how Riko is going to live her life.

00:28:56.101 --> 00:28:57.135
Thank you for the food.

00:29:08.880 --> 00:29:10.682
I'll make dinner tonight.

00:29:11.382 --> 00:29:14.385
Are you sure?
Aren't you busy with work?

00:29:14.452 --> 00:29:16.187
That goes for both of us, right?

00:29:17.956 --> 00:29:18.957
Thank you.

00:29:32.403 --> 00:29:33.404
SENDA

00:29:33.471 --> 00:29:35.206
Want to meet at FREEDOM tonight?

00:29:59.297 --> 00:30:00.298
MAYA

00:30:00.365 --> 00:30:02.167
I'll get there a bit late.

00:30:21.152 --> 00:30:22.153
Maya.

00:30:25.590 --> 00:30:27.058
I'm sorry to keep you waiting.

00:30:29.027 --> 00:30:30.528
Shall we go?

00:30:31.996 --> 00:30:32.997
Well...

00:30:35.934 --> 00:30:36.935
What is it?

00:30:40.338 --> 00:30:43.808
This will be the last time
we meet just the two of us.

00:30:45.543 --> 00:30:46.544
What?

00:30:49.047 --> 00:30:50.515
My husband came back.

00:30:53.418 --> 00:30:55.653
So...

00:30:59.257 --> 00:31:03.862
I want to give it
another shot with him.

00:31:07.232 --> 00:31:08.233
So...

00:31:09.834 --> 00:31:10.935
I'm sorry.

00:31:12.303 --> 00:31:14.072
I'm grateful to you.

00:31:16.040 --> 00:31:17.942
You were always there to listen

00:31:18.943 --> 00:31:20.845
and gave me strength.

00:31:25.717 --> 00:31:26.718
But this...

00:31:30.188 --> 00:31:31.189
is farewell.

00:31:37.228 --> 00:31:38.229
No.

00:31:39.130 --> 00:31:40.331
I can't say farewell.

00:31:42.433 --> 00:31:43.501
Mr. Senda.

00:31:52.677 --> 00:31:55.546
You can't run from me.

00:31:59.117 --> 00:32:00.118
What?

00:32:01.185 --> 00:32:03.488
Man, I was shocked.

00:32:04.455 --> 00:32:08.893
I mean, you three were drinking
like nothing ever happened.

00:32:10.662 --> 00:32:11.829
Murderers.

00:32:13.631 --> 00:32:14.732
Murderers?

00:32:15.767 --> 00:32:16.834
What do you mean?

00:32:17.769 --> 00:32:18.770
What?

00:32:19.370 --> 00:32:20.371
What's this?

00:32:21.205 --> 00:32:22.206
Did you forget

00:32:22.874 --> 00:32:24.208
about 15 years ago?

00:32:28.513 --> 00:32:29.948
You killed him, didn't you?

00:32:30.982 --> 00:32:32.116
On that mountain.

00:32:33.051 --> 00:32:34.185
The three of you.

00:32:35.853 --> 00:32:37.155
When the man attacked you.

00:32:42.193 --> 00:32:43.895
How do I know?

00:32:46.998 --> 00:32:48.066
I was there.

00:32:49.634 --> 00:32:50.635
What?

00:32:53.104 --> 00:32:56.374
We were a group of three, too.

00:33:00.078 --> 00:33:01.112
Eat up.

00:33:03.147 --> 00:33:04.148
Hello?

00:33:05.550 --> 00:33:07.652
Come on, do your job.

00:33:08.486 --> 00:33:10.021
His batting average sucks.

00:33:10.088 --> 00:33:11.456
No way.

00:33:11.522 --> 00:33:13.224
I'm sorry I took so long.

00:33:14.959 --> 00:33:16.527
What? Where are the girls?

00:33:18.997 --> 00:33:19.998
You're late.

00:33:20.465 --> 00:33:21.699
We finished ages ago.

00:33:23.201 --> 00:33:24.202
I'm sorry.

00:33:24.369 --> 00:33:26.471
You're such a slowpoke.

00:33:28.339 --> 00:33:29.340
Oh, here.

00:33:35.680 --> 00:33:38.016
Man, this is great though.

00:33:39.150 --> 00:33:40.151
Hey, Senda.

00:33:40.218 --> 00:33:41.986
- Yes?
- You're on lookout duty again.

00:33:42.920 --> 00:33:43.921
What?

00:33:44.589 --> 00:33:45.790
It's happening tonight.

00:33:48.426 --> 00:33:49.427
Okay.

00:33:49.494 --> 00:33:52.030
Yes, thank you so much!

00:33:52.096 --> 00:33:53.631
I'm pumped!

00:33:54.198 --> 00:33:55.967
I'm super excited.

00:33:59.537 --> 00:34:01.072
You'd better listen to me.

00:34:04.175 --> 00:34:06.944
- All right.
- Stop it!

00:34:07.612 --> 00:34:09.013
I feel so bad for her.

00:34:10.848 --> 00:34:13.051
- What are you doing?
- Oh, crap!

00:34:13.951 --> 00:34:17.021
- Wait!
- You're in my way!

00:34:17.088 --> 00:34:18.823
Hold on there...

00:34:23.594 --> 00:34:25.963
- He deserves this.
- What the hell is wrong

00:34:26.030 --> 00:34:27.498
with you damn women?

00:34:40.211 --> 00:34:42.113
Ready? Push.

00:34:48.820 --> 00:34:51.155
See? I even caught you
when you pushed him.

00:34:53.091 --> 00:34:55.827
It's a shame your faces
are hard to see, though.

00:34:58.529 --> 00:35:00.698
I don't know anything about that!

00:35:00.832 --> 00:35:01.833
Should I turn you in?

00:35:03.334 --> 00:35:06.337
I bet they can ID you
by matching your voices.

00:35:07.572 --> 00:35:11.409
Man, I almost didn't believe it
when I first saw you.

00:35:13.511 --> 00:35:15.279
But then I saw your reactions.

00:35:16.280 --> 00:35:20.685
Were you hurt by another man before?

00:35:21.185 --> 00:35:22.787
Want to go camping sometime?

00:35:23.121 --> 00:35:24.922
Not your style?

00:35:25.756 --> 00:35:28.159
Running doesn't make
things disappear.

00:35:29.227 --> 00:35:30.661
It'll come back to you eventually.

00:35:39.637 --> 00:35:40.938
That was fun.

00:35:42.807 --> 00:35:43.808
Now then.

00:35:45.543 --> 00:35:46.544
What now?

00:35:50.481 --> 00:35:53.351
You'll do whatever I say, right?

00:38:03.714 --> 00:38:05.683
How long will this cycle

00:38:05.916 --> 00:38:10.621
of attracting and consoling
each other continue?

00:38:11.789 --> 00:38:17.128
I feel like happiness
is both present and fading away.

00:38:18.129 --> 00:38:22.166
Happiness is truly
selfish and conflicting.

00:38:23.167 --> 00:38:26.971
Next week on Please Die My Beloved.

00:38:28.172 --> 00:38:30.574
"Ambiguous Red String."

00:38:30.875 --> 00:38:32.877
