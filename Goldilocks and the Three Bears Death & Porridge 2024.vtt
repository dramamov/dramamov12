about one of my

Maybe they're selling the place?

Or maybe long-term rental?

Or maybe they've gone abroad.

that's gone on"?

they do make you see things.

Come on, darling.
You know you don't need those.

mistakes in life.

bounce back that matters most.

eating those pills.

Thank you.

those kiddie pranks?

16:45.400 --> 16:47.400
- Of course.
- Oh my God.

16:47.480 --> 16:50.000
Don't tell me
you still do the crap with,

"We have to wear
the same clothes

16:51.640 --> 16:53.040
every time we go away."

- [Nicole] We do.

16:54.840 --> 16:57.880
I'm waiting for you to tell me
we didn't actually break in,

16:58.000 --> 17:00.280
and you actually know
who lives here,

17:00.400 --> 17:02.200
and we do actually have Wi-fi

17:02.320 --> 17:04.720
and actual food in a fridge.

17:04.800 --> 17:06.160
Oh, come on!

17:06.280 --> 17:09.440
I suggest we pay the damages

17:10.000 --> 17:12.560
and not have the shenanigans
we had this time.

17:12.640 --> 17:15.160
I'll drink to that.

17:15.600 --> 17:18.000
Although we do have
to be up early in the morning.

17:18.960 --> 17:21.440
Bed now? For everyone?

17:22.440 --> 17:25.200
I gotta go check on the car.

17:26.680 --> 17:27.960
Yep. Coming.

17:34.000 --> 17:35.960
- [softly] You okay?
- Yeah, mm-hmm.

17:37.040 --> 17:39.160
[crickets chirping]

17:42.960 --> 17:47.160
[ominous drone]

17:58.320 --> 17:59.640
[distant thud]

18:05.840 --> 18:10.840
[loud clattering]

18:26.320 --> 18:29.720
[distant dogs barking]

18:55.320 --> 18:56.840
[knock on the door]

18:58.000 --> 18:59.840
[whispering] Nicole.

19:01.320 --> 19:04.480
[knocking on door]
Nicole.

19:07.320 --> 19:08.800
[whispering] Shit.

19:26.960 --> 19:32.200
[dissonant music]

19:35.360 --> 19:38.720
[dissonant music]

20:20.680 --> 20:22.280
[low rumble]

20:28.960 --> 20:30.480
[music crescendos]

20:30.560 --> 20:31.800
[assailant shouts]

20:32.480 --> 20:33.960
Happy birthday!

20:34.040 --> 20:36.840
Guys, you could've given me
a bloody heart attack.

20:38.160 --> 20:41.120
I think somebody deserves this.

20:41.200 --> 20:43.240
Yes, I do need this.

20:43.320 --> 20:45.920
[George roars playfully]
Happy birthday.

20:46.040 --> 20:47.640
Oh, George!

20:48.120 --> 20:50.720
[Nicole] Here you go.
We got you something.

20:50.960 --> 20:52.720
You shouldn't have.

20:57.520 --> 20:59.640
Oh, you guys!

20:59.720 --> 21:01.360
It's being delivered
to your apartment.

21:01.480 --> 21:03.600
You're bloody fantastic

21:03.720 --> 21:05.960
when you're not scaring
the crap out of me.

21:06.040 --> 21:07.440
Thank you so much.

21:07.560 --> 21:10.080
It's okay, just try
not to have too many nightmares.

21:10.200 --> 21:12.640
- I'll try not to.
- Appreciate it.

21:12.760 --> 21:13.960
Thank you.

21:14.040 --> 21:15.520
I'm gonna crash. I gotta prepare

21:15.600 --> 21:18.240
for a full day tomorrow
without Internet.

21:18.320 --> 21:20.480
You can't keep off
social media, can you?

21:20.600 --> 21:22.680
[sighs] I'm so glad
I was a kid in the '80s.

21:22.800 --> 21:25.280
Good night.
Sleep well if you can.

21:25.360 --> 21:27.280
I will do after that jump scare.

21:27.360 --> 21:29.120
I think you deserve
a little bit more.

21:29.240 --> 21:30.440
Oh.

21:34.880 --> 21:38.480
I do hope you're going to help
me finish this bottle of wine.

21:38.560 --> 21:41.360
[sighs] I kinda quit
alcohol last summer.

21:41.480 --> 21:43.200
Oh. Why is that?

21:43.280 --> 21:44.680
I'll tell you another time.

21:44.800 --> 21:47.320
Gosh, you're so mysterious!

21:47.400 --> 21:49.760
- Why?
- I am?

21:49.840 --> 21:51.400
Mmm, very much so.

21:51.480 --> 21:54.440
- I hope in a good way.
- [laughs] Yes.

21:54.520 --> 21:58.680
Quite so. Yeah,
you know, all night,

21:58.760 --> 22:00.320
I've been wanting to kiss you.

22:00.440 --> 22:02.080
Come on, the wine's talking now.

22:02.160 --> 22:04.400
No, no, no it's not.

22:07.080 --> 22:10.480
So your birthday has been
quite interesting, hasn't it?

22:10.560 --> 22:12.760
- Yeah.
- Hmm.

22:12.880 --> 22:14.960
Come on, have
a little bit more wine.

22:15.680 --> 22:18.120
- You can drink.
- I can drink.

22:18.200 --> 22:20.040
Yes. Thank you.

22:20.640 --> 22:24.920
Well, listen,
you have a lovely night.

22:25.040 --> 22:27.240
And don't let anybody
sleep in your room

22:27.360 --> 22:29.680
because you don't know
who to trust anymore.

22:48.400 --> 22:51.920
Thank God this bed's not hard.

23:04.200 --> 23:06.720
This bed is just right.

23:09.720 --> 23:13.360
[sinister noises
in the distance]

23:14.600 --> 23:17.400
[distant clattering]

23:18.480 --> 23:21.320
- [thuds]
- Who's making that bloody noise?

23:23.160 --> 23:25.240
[thudding continues]

23:26.360 --> 23:28.640
It's 4 am!

23:35.520 --> 23:39.240
[ominous music]

24:17.680 --> 24:21.680
[Goldilocks hums
juvenile melody]

24:36.760 --> 24:41.720
[birdsong]

24:41.840 --> 24:45.760
[indistinct voice
of radio announcer]

24:54.080 --> 24:57.240
[radio announcer continues]

25:03.200 --> 25:05.240
[radio announcer continues]

25:07.200 --> 25:09.880
[ominous droning]

25:21.200 --> 25:23.160
[pills rattle]

25:41.120 --> 25:42.840
[leaves rustling]

25:57.320 --> 26:02.880
Ahh, who's been
eating my porridge?

26:05.800 --> 26:09.120
- Good morning, Simon.
- Good morning, sir. How are you?

26:09.200 --> 26:10.440
I'm good.
How was your night?

26:10.560 --> 26:12.640
[Simon] Ahh, it was okay.

26:12.760 --> 26:16.440
Just, you know, I'm starving now
cos I did a bit of workout.

26:16.560 --> 26:17.840
I know how you feel.

26:17.920 --> 26:19.960
Mm-hmm. Mmm!

26:20.360 --> 26:22.760
This doesn't taste very good.
How's yours?

26:23.280 --> 26:24.720
Mine's a bit too hot.

26:25.200 --> 26:28.240
Yeah. I gotta ask you, right?

26:28.800 --> 26:32.120
Don't you think it's strange?
Four plates, four bowls...

26:32.240 --> 26:34.320
Like, what...
what the fuck?

26:34.400 --> 26:37.240
- [Simon] What do you think?
- Yeah.

26:38.160 --> 26:40.680
- It does seem a bit strange.
- Mm-hmm.

26:40.760 --> 26:44.160
Maybe they like the number four?
Could be a family of four.

26:44.240 --> 26:47.720
[Simon] So did you really do
this or was it one of the guys?

26:48.240 --> 26:49.920
Perhaps Nicole or Kelly.

26:51.240 --> 26:53.440
Aww! Good morning!

26:53.520 --> 26:56.440
- [Jas] Good morning.
- Oh, someone's made breakfast!

26:56.680 --> 26:59.040
- Good job, Simon!
- Oh!

26:59.240 --> 27:01.440
Just talking to Jas about that.

27:01.520 --> 27:04.160
We don't know
who did it, you know?

27:04.280 --> 27:05.960
Don't know, it's strange.

27:06.480 --> 27:07.840
How did you sleep?

27:08.560 --> 27:13.400
Ah, well, some may say
like a baby bear.

27:13.520 --> 27:15.000
[everyone laughs]

27:15.120 --> 27:17.400
Here I am. Oh, sweet!

27:17.480 --> 27:19.680
Porridge and a cup of tea!

27:19.800 --> 27:21.680
Perfect thing to wake me up

27:21.800 --> 27:23.840
after being shafted
by a cold shower.

27:23.960 --> 27:26.960
Well, I can think
of other ways to start the day.

27:28.040 --> 27:29.640
Geez!

27:29.720 --> 27:32.480
[panting]

27:32.600 --> 27:36.720
That tea was way too hot!

27:39.080 --> 27:40.120
Sorry, guys.

27:40.240 --> 27:42.600
[laughing] Oh, George!

27:45.360 --> 27:46.840
- Mmm.
- [Kelly] Oh, no.

27:47.880 --> 27:49.440
Oh, God.

27:50.600 --> 27:54.800
That porridge is way too cold!

28:02.120 --> 28:03.680
You know what you
can actually do?

28:03.800 --> 28:06.400
Pour the hot tea
in your porridge

28:06.480 --> 28:08.040
and have it that way.

28:08.520 --> 28:10.680
- Genius!
- [Simon clears throat]

28:19.160 --> 28:23.440
Mmm. Now this is just right.

28:23.560 --> 28:26.120
- Thanks, Simon.
- [Simon] Mm-hmm.

28:26.200 --> 28:27.520
Has anyone seen Nicole?

28:27.600 --> 28:29.880
- No.
- I'm gonna go for a shower soon,

28:30.000 --> 28:33.280
so I can check in on her room
and see if she's still in there.

28:33.400 --> 28:35.240
Good luck with the shower.

28:35.320 --> 28:37.200
- What do you mean?
- No hot water.

28:37.280 --> 28:39.360
I checked the water supply
this morning.

28:39.480 --> 28:42.680
Turns out somebody
has cut off the water tank.

28:42.760 --> 28:45.400
- [Kelly] Oh.
- Does anyone know about this?

28:45.520 --> 28:47.960
Who cuts off the water supply
on the first night?

28:48.080 --> 28:50.960
- Yeah.
- That's not normal.

28:51.040 --> 28:53.840
You are overthinking it.

28:55.760 --> 28:57.600
- I don't think I am.
- Mm-hmm.

28:58.800 --> 29:01.280
- Okay.
- This tastes off.

29:01.800 --> 29:03.480
- How's yours?
- Really hot.

29:03.600 --> 29:06.480
[George] You mean cold.
How much wine did you drink?

29:06.600 --> 29:09.560
[Kelly] I'm gonna go get
a shower and let this cool down.

29:09.680 --> 29:11.160
Mm-hmm.

29:12.480 --> 29:15.200
We've got to get ready
to leave as well soon.

29:18.520 --> 29:23.680
[ominous droning]

29:26.880 --> 29:29.880
I had to put another jumper on.
I was getting cold.

29:30.000 --> 29:32.400
- Ohh.
- Where's the car?

29:36.720 --> 29:39.120
[Jas] It was just there
last night.

29:39.600 --> 29:41.960
You telling me
she's driven off without us?

29:45.120 --> 29:46.720
Hey, guys, we can't find...

29:46.840 --> 29:47.920
Oh, for fuck's sake.

29:48.040 --> 29:49.560
Is this another prank?

29:52.160 --> 29:53.720
[Simon sighs]

29:53.840 --> 29:55.720
[Jas] So you really think
it's Nicole?

29:55.800 --> 30:01.160
[stammering] Yeah, she's been
having, like, medication stuff.

30:01.240 --> 30:03.000
Simon, are you okay?

30:03.120 --> 30:05.200
I've just got a bad headache,
that's all.

30:05.320 --> 30:07.400
No, she's been taking
a lot of...

30:07.520 --> 30:08.800
[George] Grab him, Jas.

30:08.920 --> 30:10.600
Let's get him inside.

30:11.480 --> 30:14.680
Come on, Simon.
Come on. [grunts]

30:20.120 --> 30:23.640
[foreboding music]

30:28.160 --> 30:29.400
[George grunts]

30:30.760 --> 30:32.200
[whispering] God.

30:32.960 --> 30:34.440
What could it be?

30:37.400 --> 30:38.760
[Jas] Not sure.

30:41.240 --> 30:42.480
Maybe something he ate?

30:42.600 --> 30:44.560
All he's had is porridge
and a protein bar.

30:44.640 --> 30:46.640
I think he's been poisoned.

30:47.640 --> 30:50.680
That's not possible.
We all ate the porridge.

30:50.800 --> 30:52.440
I knew
we should've had a fry-up.

30:52.520 --> 30:54.280
[Jas] It's not the time
for jokes.

30:54.360 --> 30:57.400
- Sorry.
- I'll get him a glass of water.

30:58.440 --> 30:59.840
[Jas] Good idea.

31:14.120 --> 31:17.720
Don't worry, Simon.
I'll get you some help.

31:24.080 --> 31:26.640
- Want me to come with?
- No thanks, George.

31:27.560 --> 31:29.240
I'll be quicker on my own.

31:29.320 --> 31:32.960
Where are you going?
Don't go too far!

31:58.320 --> 32:00.880
[birdsong]

32:06.960 --> 32:10.800
[ominous droning]

32:23.480 --> 32:27.480
[crunching footsteps]

32:38.640 --> 32:41.640
[ominous tone rises]

32:45.280 --> 32:50.880
[ominous tone crescendos]

32:51.000 --> 32:57.160
[mysterious music]

33:02.000 --> 33:03.880
- Simon?
- Who's there?

33:04.320 --> 33:05.840
[Kelly] You'll be okay.

33:07.600 --> 33:09.680
Yeah, you're still quite hot.

33:09.760 --> 33:12.920
- [Simon murmurs indistinctly]
- Does that mean get some water?

33:13.040 --> 33:15.480
I'll get you a glass of water.

33:24.880 --> 33:26.400
[distant shriek]

33:29.760 --> 33:30.960
[George groans]

33:32.280 --> 33:33.720
[George grunts]

34:48.960 --> 34:51.400
[stairs creak faintly]

34:59.160 --> 35:01.240
[ominous tone]

35:01.360 --> 35:04.280
[sinister laughter
from unknown source]

35:27.600 --> 35:29.320
[distant thud and clatter]

35:37.000 --> 35:38.760
[telephone ringing]

35:41.800 --> 35:43.240
[ringing]

35:46.240 --> 35:47.440
[ringing]

35:50.920 --> 35:52.480
[heavy breathing on phone]

35:52.600 --> 35:53.680
Hello?

35:55.680 --> 35:56.840
Hello?

36:26.160 --> 36:28.480
[sinister laughter]

36:29.480 --> 36:31.400
Shit, I just saw
someone outside.

36:31.520 --> 36:33.040
[distant thud]

36:33.120 --> 36:34.360
[Kelly] What the hell?

36:34.480 --> 36:35.920
It's probably just
Jas playing games.

36:36.000 --> 36:38.800
- [thumping]
- No, that is not Jas.

36:38.920 --> 36:40.320
[distant thud]

36:40.400 --> 36:41.920
Did we lock the doors?

36:42.000 --> 36:43.600
I think so.

36:44.680 --> 36:46.760
Unless Jas is Houdini,

36:46.840 --> 36:49.520
that's probably just a bunch
of kids messing around.

36:49.600 --> 36:52.440
That's not possible. We are
the only house in this forest.

36:52.560 --> 36:55.040
- It's literally just us.
- What about the landline?

36:55.160 --> 36:56.720
- Still not working.
- Shit.

36:56.840 --> 37:00.120
It's not a good idea to call
the police when we broke in.

37:00.240 --> 37:01.960
Shit! What're we gonna do?

37:02.080 --> 37:04.760
We're gonna have to stick
together until Jas gets back.

37:04.880 --> 37:07.640
There's no telling how long
that'll be. I need to check.

37:07.720 --> 37:10.320
You can't do that.
You don't know who's outside.

37:10.400 --> 37:11.960
It's probably the fucking kids.

37:12.040 --> 37:14.720
Just stay here, check on Simon,
and lock the door.

37:14.800 --> 37:15.800
Shit!

37:15.920 --> 37:19.720
[ominous droning]

37:21.000 --> 37:22.960
[crickets chirping]

37:28.480 --> 37:29.840
[door latch catches]

37:37.680 --> 37:38.720
Jas?

37:40.120 --> 37:41.320
Jas!

38:01.560 --> 38:03.640
[distant owl hooting]

38:27.600 --> 38:33.720
[ominous tone rises]

38:33.840 --> 38:36.360
[sudden silence]

38:54.440 --> 38:56.760
[door creaking]

39:21.200 --> 39:23.320
[pills rattling]

39:27.320 --> 39:28.800
[bottle cap clacking]

39:33.000 --> 39:34.760
[pills rattling]

39:51.000 --> 39:52.800
Just as bad as Nicole.

39:53.440 --> 39:56.840
[pills rattle]

40:06.760 --> 40:10.000
[dissonant music]

40:10.720 --> 40:13.520
[distant screaming
and indistinct speech]

40:13.640 --> 40:15.840
[male voice] Wake up now!

01:07:08.080 --> 01:07:09.720
There's a young girl here.

What do you mean? Who?

01:07:12.160 --> 01:07:16.240
She's in the other room resting.
She's running from something.

What girl?

01:07:17.640 --> 01:07:20.080
She said something
about Goldilocks

For fuck's sake,
Goldilocks and the bears?

01:07:26.480 --> 01:07:27.840
She's probably on drugs
or something.

01:07:27.920 --> 01:07:29.880
You know what kids
are like these days.

01:07:30.000 --> 01:07:32.040
She really was frightened.

01:07:35.120 --> 01:07:36.520
The police?

01:07:36.640 --> 01:07:38.840
I told her to have
a rest for a while.

01:07:38.920 --> 01:07:41.120
Thought it best
to wait 'til you got back.

01:07:41.240 --> 01:07:43.040
We'll let her sleep
the drugs off,

01:07:43.120 --> 01:07:45.640
then we'll find out
what's wrong with her, okay?

01:07:45.760 --> 01:07:47.920
You know, I don't mind
helping people,

01:07:48.000 --> 01:07:50.760
