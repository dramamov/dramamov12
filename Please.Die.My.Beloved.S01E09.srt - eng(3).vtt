WEBVTT

00:00:02.736 --> 00:00:05.538
- We still haven't found a new home.
- Thinking back

00:00:05.972 --> 00:00:08.908
there was always a bite
in her remarks.

00:00:08.975 --> 00:00:13.680
It'll be hard to find a place
that you'll both be satisfied with.

00:00:14.047 --> 00:00:15.348
Right?

00:00:18.618 --> 00:00:21.321
But Maya's finally
getting married, right?

00:00:21.488 --> 00:00:23.390
I ended up being the last one, huh?

00:00:23.456 --> 00:00:26.760
Hey, the order doesn't matter,
right, Yurika?

00:00:26.826 --> 00:00:29.662
But this guy isn't your usual type.

00:00:30.096 --> 00:00:31.097
My usual type?

00:00:31.164 --> 00:00:33.199
Oh, in a good way.

00:00:34.434 --> 00:00:36.436
He's not what I imagined.

00:00:37.437 --> 00:00:42.709
How do I put this?
Mitsuhiro is a really nice guy.

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:45.011
Really?

00:00:46.112 --> 00:00:47.113
Yes.

00:00:47.547 --> 00:00:48.915
He's perfect for you.

00:00:51.418 --> 00:00:52.419
Thank you.

00:00:52.752 --> 00:00:55.188
No, I'm glad he's a good guy.

00:00:55.321 --> 00:00:57.624
She always compared herself to me

00:00:58.358 --> 00:01:00.260
as if it were a contest.

00:01:00.527 --> 00:01:01.528
Hey, Mitsuhiro.

00:01:01.828 --> 00:01:04.264
Yurika used to work
at a general trading company.

00:01:04.330 --> 00:01:05.432
Goodness!

00:01:05.665 --> 00:01:07.300
You must be so smart.

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:08.501
No, not at all.

00:01:08.668 --> 00:01:11.671
But she quit
as soon as she got married.

00:01:12.872 --> 00:01:15.542
Being a full-time housewife
is impressive.

00:01:15.842 --> 00:01:17.377
That competitiveness...

00:01:17.444 --> 00:01:20.113
- No, it's not.
- I could never do that.

00:01:20.647 --> 00:01:23.083
...surely exuded from me, too.

00:01:23.383 --> 00:01:25.018
I could never do it.

00:01:25.885 --> 00:01:26.886
No way.

00:01:27.554 --> 00:01:28.922
You're incredible.

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:33.126
Well, I don't think
I could stop working for a while.

00:01:35.061 --> 00:01:36.729
- Good luck.
- Yes.

00:01:36.996 --> 00:01:41.034
Did that actually provoke
Yurika even more?

00:02:29.949 --> 00:02:31.317
I don't want to believe it.

00:02:36.256 --> 00:02:38.124
ODEN SHOP MARUTA

00:02:39.092 --> 00:02:44.697
ODEN SHOP MARUTA

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:49.569
Your husband was at this oden shop?

00:02:50.703 --> 00:02:51.704
Yes.

00:02:52.906 --> 00:02:53.907
I see.

00:02:55.108 --> 00:02:57.210
We'll look into this as well.

00:02:57.477 --> 00:02:58.478
Well...

00:03:08.454 --> 00:03:11.491
He might've been with her.

00:03:12.692 --> 00:03:13.693
Who is this?

00:03:15.828 --> 00:03:17.964
A friend of mine.

00:03:22.101 --> 00:03:24.337
Can you check for me

00:03:25.838 --> 00:03:27.473
if it was really her?

00:03:30.710 --> 00:03:32.212
Are you sure you want us to check?

00:03:36.416 --> 00:03:38.251
I'm too scared to ask her myself.

00:03:43.556 --> 00:03:44.557
Ma'am.

00:03:45.925 --> 00:03:46.926
Yes?

00:03:49.529 --> 00:03:52.765
Do you really want him to come back?

00:04:00.206 --> 00:04:01.207
Yes.

00:05:22.689 --> 00:05:25.725
PLEASE DIE MY BELOVED

00:05:34.100 --> 00:05:35.868
I'll pay the oden shop a visit.

00:05:36.069 --> 00:05:38.004
Yes, thank you.

00:05:44.711 --> 00:05:47.680
Must be tough knowing your husband
cheated with your friend.

00:05:48.448 --> 00:05:50.416
Keep tabs on Yurika Sakaki for now.

00:05:51.384 --> 00:05:52.385
Yes, sir.

00:06:05.765 --> 00:06:06.966
Have a good day.

00:06:08.534 --> 00:06:09.969
I'll come home early.

00:06:11.170 --> 00:06:12.171
I see.

00:06:13.806 --> 00:06:15.541
Want to drink more?

00:06:27.553 --> 00:06:28.721
Get ready.

00:06:37.930 --> 00:06:39.165
So gross!

00:06:39.232 --> 00:06:43.403
Hurry up and die!

00:06:51.310 --> 00:06:52.311
Riko.

00:06:52.545 --> 00:06:54.847
I made you lunch, so have some later.

00:06:59.919 --> 00:07:03.856
And I did some meal prep,
so eat this, too.

00:07:08.928 --> 00:07:10.363
I went to the doctor's.

00:07:10.963 --> 00:07:12.465
They said the baby is healthy.

00:07:13.866 --> 00:07:15.568
It's finally starting to feel real.

00:07:17.236 --> 00:07:18.237
I'm fine with just us.

00:07:20.606 --> 00:07:21.607
What?

00:07:22.041 --> 00:07:24.744
I like it
when it's just the two of us.

00:07:27.747 --> 00:07:28.748
So...

00:07:31.250 --> 00:07:32.485
let's get an abortion.

00:07:38.191 --> 00:07:39.192
Ryosuke?

00:07:42.094 --> 00:07:43.496
You're not serious, right?

00:07:48.234 --> 00:07:50.870
I love you, Riko.

00:07:52.038 --> 00:07:53.806
I want to live with you,
the two of us.

00:07:55.575 --> 00:07:56.909
Don't you?

00:08:21.901 --> 00:08:23.135
Here.

00:08:23.503 --> 00:08:25.571
It's freshwater clam miso soup.

00:08:26.138 --> 00:08:27.340
Warm it up first, okay?

00:08:28.841 --> 00:08:30.943
It's full of Vitamin B12.

00:08:32.512 --> 00:08:33.946
Okay, then.

00:08:34.647 --> 00:08:36.582
Oh, that's right.

00:08:37.316 --> 00:08:38.651
These supplements.

00:08:39.151 --> 00:08:41.654
I heard they're good for the baby.

00:08:42.455 --> 00:08:43.456
Take these.

00:08:51.430 --> 00:08:52.431
Gosh, you need water.

00:08:52.798 --> 00:08:54.767
Water. One second.

00:08:55.101 --> 00:08:56.769
Water...

00:09:04.510 --> 00:09:06.412
KUMABE ESTATE

00:09:06.479 --> 00:09:08.180
You take it back?

00:09:09.749 --> 00:09:10.950
I apologize.

00:09:12.084 --> 00:09:14.554
Please cancel
my letter of resignation.

00:09:16.022 --> 00:09:17.023
Well...

00:09:17.557 --> 00:09:21.093
I'm honestly happy
that you're staying, but...

00:09:24.430 --> 00:09:25.431
Fine.

00:09:28.134 --> 00:09:30.303
Considering your bold show
of shamelessness here

00:09:31.304 --> 00:09:33.139
I'll throw out your letter.

00:09:34.840 --> 00:09:35.875
Thank you.

00:09:35.942 --> 00:09:39.712
However, your replacement
has already been decided.

00:09:40.947 --> 00:09:42.682
Your old position is gone.

00:09:45.818 --> 00:09:48.120
Yes, I understand.

00:09:49.555 --> 00:09:50.556
Really?

00:09:51.524 --> 00:09:53.492
Then, good luck working under her.

00:10:04.337 --> 00:10:05.771
Maya.

00:10:07.073 --> 00:10:08.441
I'll be in your care.

00:10:09.709 --> 00:10:11.310
I'll talk to the chief.

00:10:11.377 --> 00:10:12.378
No.

00:10:13.012 --> 00:10:15.014
Having you work under me

00:10:15.581 --> 00:10:16.882
isn't right.

00:10:17.617 --> 00:10:18.618
It's fine.

00:10:18.884 --> 00:10:22.355
- But...
- I'll be in your care as well.

00:10:24.724 --> 00:10:25.725
Maya.

00:10:32.698 --> 00:10:35.701
Hello, I look forward
to working with you again.

00:10:37.937 --> 00:10:39.372
I can't believe her.

00:10:40.539 --> 00:10:42.508
This will be hard on Kana, too.

00:10:42.942 --> 00:10:44.243
Well, let's see how this goes.

00:10:48.681 --> 00:10:51.417
Hello, I'll be in your care.

00:11:07.466 --> 00:11:09.502
- I look forward to working with you.
- Me, too.

00:11:17.510 --> 00:11:18.511
YURIKA

00:11:18.577 --> 00:11:20.513
Can we push the date up?
I can't take this anymore.

00:11:20.579 --> 00:11:21.714
Let's meet up. Please respond.

00:11:56.048 --> 00:11:58.584
Now all I need is...

00:12:07.993 --> 00:12:10.429
MAYA

00:12:10.496 --> 00:12:13.632
I'm sorry,
I can't get involved anymore.

00:12:54.540 --> 00:12:56.776
Yes, how are things over there?

00:12:57.710 --> 00:12:59.445
She just left the hardware store.

00:13:01.280 --> 00:13:03.482
But she's not doing
anything particularly shady.

00:13:04.750 --> 00:13:05.751
I see.

00:13:16.061 --> 00:13:17.863
Okay, keep up the good work.

00:13:29.041 --> 00:13:30.309
I missed you, Riko.

00:13:33.112 --> 00:13:34.113
Let's go.

00:13:39.618 --> 00:13:40.619
Riko?

00:13:42.288 --> 00:13:43.322
I...

00:13:49.962 --> 00:13:50.963
want to keep it.

00:13:52.164 --> 00:13:53.165
What?

00:13:55.601 --> 00:13:57.436
I can't abort it.

00:14:02.675 --> 00:14:05.611
Riko, think long and hard about this.

00:14:07.279 --> 00:14:08.981
It doesn't end after giving birth.

00:14:10.816 --> 00:14:11.851
I know.

00:14:14.653 --> 00:14:17.189
Your way of life will change.

00:14:20.292 --> 00:14:21.627
You're choosing the baby

00:14:22.261 --> 00:14:23.429
over spending time with me?

00:14:45.684 --> 00:14:46.685
Excuse me.

00:14:47.553 --> 00:14:48.554
Yes?

00:14:48.621 --> 00:14:50.689
I'm sorry, where's the train station?

00:14:51.824 --> 00:14:52.825
Not sure.

00:15:03.802 --> 00:15:05.337
He smells like medicine?

00:15:25.925 --> 00:15:28.694
Hello, thank you for the other day.

00:15:28.928 --> 00:15:31.163
Please don't talk to me here.

00:15:31.530 --> 00:15:33.098
- But--
- Goodbye.

00:15:38.637 --> 00:15:40.806
- Do you have a moment?
- Yes.

00:15:40.873 --> 00:15:42.608
I'm with the police.

00:15:43.943 --> 00:15:44.977
I see.

00:15:45.077 --> 00:15:47.279
How do you know that lady?

00:15:48.747 --> 00:15:49.915
I don't really know her.

00:15:50.616 --> 00:15:52.251
She called out to me on the street.

00:15:52.918 --> 00:15:55.754
I think it was last Saturday.

00:15:55.821 --> 00:15:56.855
Last Saturday?

00:15:56.922 --> 00:15:57.923
Yes.

00:15:57.990 --> 00:15:58.991
Please take one.

00:16:09.535 --> 00:16:10.569
Please take one.

00:16:11.236 --> 00:16:12.404
Thank you.

00:16:20.045 --> 00:16:21.146
Excuse me.

00:16:23.382 --> 00:16:24.383
Take some.

00:16:25.884 --> 00:16:28.454
Do you have time after this?

00:16:29.088 --> 00:16:30.089
What?

00:16:30.456 --> 00:16:33.792
She said she'd give me 10,000 yen
if I posed for some photos.

00:16:34.259 --> 00:16:36.595
I just needed to show
bits of myself, like my hands.

00:16:44.136 --> 00:16:45.137
All right.

00:16:46.638 --> 00:16:50.109
TODAY'S DATE WITH MY HUSBAND

00:16:50.175 --> 00:16:51.343
#LUNCHDATE #MOTHER

00:16:51.410 --> 00:16:52.611
All right.

00:16:53.412 --> 00:16:54.446
This looks good.

00:16:58.050 --> 00:16:59.218
Don't tell anyone.

00:17:00.386 --> 00:17:01.387
What?

00:17:09.828 --> 00:17:11.663
Don't tell anyone about today.

00:17:12.965 --> 00:17:15.434
Forget that you ever met me.

00:17:20.506 --> 00:17:22.541
I even changed clothes for her

00:17:23.275 --> 00:17:25.210
but even just greeting her
made her snap at me.

00:17:28.113 --> 00:17:29.248
Are we done here?

00:17:32.217 --> 00:17:34.086
Here's the photo.

00:17:34.353 --> 00:17:36.522
It was on Yurika Sakaki's
social media.

00:17:38.857 --> 00:17:41.527
She was pretending
to be on a date with her husband?

00:17:42.194 --> 00:17:43.195
Yes.

00:17:43.395 --> 00:17:46.532
She even paid a passerby
to keep him quiet.

00:17:48.167 --> 00:17:51.537
And she's gotten involved
with a medical professional.

00:17:51.770 --> 00:17:53.772
This is so messy.

00:17:54.273 --> 00:17:56.375
Looks like
we should take this seriously.

00:17:56.809 --> 00:17:59.011
- You should always do that.
- Right.

00:17:59.144 --> 00:18:01.346
TODAY'S DATE WITH MY HUSBAND
#LUNCHDATE #MOTHER

00:18:01.413 --> 00:18:03.549
SO WONDERFUL!
JEALOUS OF YOUR RELATIONSHIP!

00:18:03.615 --> 00:18:06.952
EVEN YOUR HUSBAND IS PERFECT!
WHAT A WONDERFUL DATE!

00:18:09.988 --> 00:18:13.926
Act like a loving couple
to prove you have no motive.

00:18:14.693 --> 00:18:16.428
This is perfect.

00:18:31.877 --> 00:18:32.878
Hey.

00:18:34.179 --> 00:18:35.180
Hurry it up.

00:18:37.182 --> 00:18:38.517
Okay, coming!

00:18:43.455 --> 00:18:44.990
I'm sorry to keep you waiting.

00:18:49.161 --> 00:18:50.229
Good work today.

00:18:57.269 --> 00:18:58.704
About the divorce...

00:18:59.471 --> 00:19:00.472
Yes?

00:19:01.006 --> 00:19:02.274
I'll rethink it.

00:19:03.942 --> 00:19:04.943
Really?

00:19:06.311 --> 00:19:09.548
Tell me again
why you don't want to divorce me.

00:19:10.682 --> 00:19:11.683
What?

00:19:11.817 --> 00:19:12.818
You know

00:19:13.185 --> 00:19:14.620
that it's not for Yuna.

00:19:17.956 --> 00:19:19.057
It's for me.

00:19:20.125 --> 00:19:22.995
I don't want to separate from you.

00:19:26.231 --> 00:19:27.432
Say it.

00:19:30.068 --> 00:19:31.703
I don't want it.

00:19:33.005 --> 00:19:34.006
Right?

00:19:34.773 --> 00:19:36.842
You can't survive without me.

00:19:38.443 --> 00:19:40.913
I've always provided for you

00:19:41.246 --> 00:19:43.282
since you can't work a proper job.

00:19:47.252 --> 00:19:50.055
Just do as you're told.

00:19:50.122 --> 00:19:52.191
That's the kind of woman you are.

00:19:56.495 --> 00:19:58.463
I hold your life

00:19:58.897 --> 00:20:02.034
in the palm of my hand, got it?

00:20:36.568 --> 00:20:37.769
I'm home.

00:20:50.349 --> 00:20:51.550
Riko?

00:20:55.120 --> 00:20:56.121
Riko.

00:21:00.592 --> 00:21:01.593
Riko!

00:21:05.430 --> 00:21:06.431
I'm home.

00:21:07.499 --> 00:21:08.500
Welcome home.

00:21:08.867 --> 00:21:10.302
It started snowing.

00:21:11.470 --> 00:21:12.471
Isn't it cold?

00:21:13.071 --> 00:21:14.072
No.

00:21:16.041 --> 00:21:17.376
How's your body?

00:21:18.176 --> 00:21:19.177
I'm fine.

00:21:21.713 --> 00:21:25.517
I made my special stamina stir-fry
for dinner again. Is that okay?

00:21:26.652 --> 00:21:28.754
I'm sorry about my small repertoire.

00:21:31.256 --> 00:21:34.026
But I bought your favorite ice cream.

00:21:35.827 --> 00:21:36.828
What?

00:21:38.697 --> 00:21:39.698
You do like it, right?

00:21:40.332 --> 00:21:41.333
Or not anymore?

00:21:43.635 --> 00:21:46.672
I heard your likes and dislikes
change when you're pregnant.

00:21:46.938 --> 00:21:48.740
Oh, right.

00:21:49.374 --> 00:21:52.311
Your love for me
might turn into hate then.

00:22:06.725 --> 00:22:08.493
Why aren't you smiling?

00:22:13.131 --> 00:22:15.867
Why do you always look
like you're suffering?

00:22:17.903 --> 00:22:19.237
It wasn't always like this.

00:22:26.011 --> 00:22:27.012
I'm sorry.

00:22:28.580 --> 00:22:29.648
It's not your fault.

00:22:31.149 --> 00:22:32.184
It's me.

00:22:33.385 --> 00:22:34.653
It's my body.

00:22:37.456 --> 00:22:38.457
Ever since that day.

00:22:41.026 --> 00:22:43.295
That's the day you stopped smiling.

00:22:45.497 --> 00:22:49.167
The test results say
the problem is on the husband's side.

00:22:52.137 --> 00:22:54.606
Unfortunately, a child is...

00:23:01.346 --> 00:23:02.447
This is great.

00:23:03.248 --> 00:23:04.249
What?

00:23:05.217 --> 00:23:09.988
After all, you and I are better off
with just the two of us.

00:23:13.492 --> 00:23:15.093
Let's be a family of two from now on.

00:23:24.403 --> 00:23:25.737
I was heartbroken.

00:23:29.408 --> 00:23:30.976
I've always been heartbroken!

00:23:32.978 --> 00:23:35.414
Since I couldn't make
your dream come true.

00:23:36.314 --> 00:23:38.750
Since I couldn't make you a mom.

00:23:39.551 --> 00:23:41.019
I felt so guilty...

00:23:45.791 --> 00:23:46.792
that my heart...

00:23:50.262 --> 00:23:53.098
felt like it'll rip open

00:23:54.332 --> 00:23:56.868
ever since that day!

00:24:15.754 --> 00:24:17.189
A water leak?

00:24:17.355 --> 00:24:18.356
Yes.

00:24:18.523 --> 00:24:21.760
I'm sorry for assigning you
something like this.

00:24:22.427 --> 00:24:24.563
No, it's okay. Leave it to me.

00:24:25.096 --> 00:24:26.631
Thank you.

00:24:26.998 --> 00:24:28.700
Kana, do you have a moment?

00:24:28.767 --> 00:24:29.935
Yes, be right there.

00:24:30.435 --> 00:24:31.670
Thank you.

00:24:34.639 --> 00:24:36.141
I'm sorry about that.

00:24:36.208 --> 00:24:37.509
About this document...

00:24:37.576 --> 00:24:40.245
- Oh, it looks good.
- Really?

00:24:40.312 --> 00:24:42.214
Can you check this, too?

00:24:44.716 --> 00:24:46.785
You don't have to panic.

00:24:48.220 --> 00:24:51.189
Right, so, for this...

00:24:51.490 --> 00:24:53.859
Maya won't get involved anymore.

00:24:54.159 --> 00:24:56.228
It's like, but we've come so far.

00:24:56.661 --> 00:24:57.662
Right?

00:24:58.563 --> 00:24:59.564
Whatever.

00:24:59.831 --> 00:25:02.133
I don't have the option
of running away.

00:25:05.036 --> 00:25:06.037
Hey, Riko.

00:25:06.104 --> 00:25:08.640
- Thank you for the food.
- Have a great day!

00:25:14.946 --> 00:25:17.282
I tried out the pills from earlier.

00:25:17.782 --> 00:25:19.117
They're not very effective.

00:25:20.085 --> 00:25:21.786
Maybe I should double it.

00:25:22.120 --> 00:25:24.489
But can he taste it then?

00:25:25.590 --> 00:25:28.827
Hey, Riko? Are you listening?

00:25:33.732 --> 00:25:34.866
Are we really doing this?

00:25:35.967 --> 00:25:36.968
What?

00:25:41.006 --> 00:25:42.207
Is killing him

00:25:44.042 --> 00:25:45.944
really the only way?

00:25:50.382 --> 00:25:52.083
You too, Riko?

00:25:53.251 --> 00:25:54.252
I'm sorry.

00:25:56.588 --> 00:25:59.157
I don't know what to do anymore.

00:26:02.327 --> 00:26:03.495
What happened?

00:26:08.567 --> 00:26:10.035
I didn't know anything

00:26:12.737 --> 00:26:14.239
about how my husband felt.

00:26:15.607 --> 00:26:17.108
So what?

00:26:18.510 --> 00:26:21.079
Of course there are things
you don't know.

00:26:21.212 --> 00:26:22.647
And who would want to know?

00:26:24.716 --> 00:26:28.486
Riko, think about everything
he put you through.

00:26:38.597 --> 00:26:42.968
It doesn't justify
what they put us through until now.

00:26:46.571 --> 00:26:47.572
Yes.

00:26:49.474 --> 00:26:51.176
I don't know what happened

00:26:51.876 --> 00:26:54.379
but don't let your sympathy sway you.

00:27:01.553 --> 00:27:03.088
So long as our husbands are alive

00:27:05.724 --> 00:27:08.727
we'll never be happy.

00:27:10.829 --> 00:27:12.130
I refuse to let that happen.

00:27:14.332 --> 00:27:17.168
I'm not a helpless woman.

00:27:18.003 --> 00:27:19.237
I'm not a useless woman.

00:27:21.239 --> 00:27:22.240
We're doing this.

00:27:23.341 --> 00:27:26.144
We don't have a choice.

00:27:37.689 --> 00:27:38.757
Eat up, okay?

00:27:47.165 --> 00:27:48.800
I sincerely apologize.

00:27:49.267 --> 00:27:51.636
Here are the compensation details.

00:27:52.103 --> 00:27:53.505
This is a big deal.

00:27:54.005 --> 00:27:56.541
We apologize for the trouble.

00:27:56.608 --> 00:27:58.343
Words aren't going to fix this.

00:27:58.643 --> 00:28:01.946
Besides, shouldn't the person
in charge be here?

00:28:02.280 --> 00:28:03.682
Talking to you is pointless.

00:28:04.683 --> 00:28:05.850
I apologize.

00:28:07.218 --> 00:28:08.520
I'm sorry.

00:28:09.087 --> 00:28:11.556
As I continue
to apologize incessantly...

00:28:15.193 --> 00:28:21.032
I start to feel worthless,
like I've made a tremendous mistake.

00:28:21.700 --> 00:28:23.201
Isn't she from building management?

00:28:23.435 --> 00:28:24.836
Oh, because of the leak.

00:28:24.903 --> 00:28:28.506
I really might've made a mistake.

00:28:31.543 --> 00:28:35.447
How did things end up this way?

00:28:45.156 --> 00:28:47.092
Where did I go wrong?

00:28:47.692 --> 00:28:50.428
...and helps out
by doing housework and such.

00:28:50.495 --> 00:28:52.530
Was it when I lied in the interview?

00:28:53.732 --> 00:28:55.333
Wait, hold on.

00:28:55.467 --> 00:28:58.403
When I pushed him away?

00:28:59.571 --> 00:29:01.473
If only you'd just die!

00:29:01.906 --> 00:29:03.141
When I...

00:29:04.642 --> 00:29:06.511
said that to Mitsuhiro?

00:29:09.514 --> 00:29:11.750
No, it's more fundamental than that.

00:29:12.917 --> 00:29:14.419
Focus more on the ball.

00:29:15.487 --> 00:29:16.788
Mr. Senda.

00:29:18.323 --> 00:29:19.324
But...

00:29:20.625 --> 00:29:22.627
good focus isn't enough.

00:29:24.362 --> 00:29:26.698
Predict the ball's trajectory and...

00:29:35.907 --> 00:29:38.510
maybe look a bit into the future.

00:29:58.196 --> 00:29:59.364
Nice swing.

00:29:59.931 --> 00:30:00.965
Watch out.

00:30:06.004 --> 00:30:09.908
Maybe it was the fact
that I chose Mitsuhiro at all.

00:30:15.280 --> 00:30:16.281
Gosh.

00:30:17.749 --> 00:30:18.783
You did a lot of swings.

00:30:19.150 --> 00:30:20.385
I'm getting blisters.

00:30:22.387 --> 00:30:23.388
Does it hurt?

00:30:24.522 --> 00:30:25.857
I went overboard.

00:30:27.158 --> 00:30:28.159
But it's okay.

00:30:28.660 --> 00:30:30.662
You have nowhere to go but up.

00:30:33.097 --> 00:30:35.400
Thank God. You're smiling.

00:30:38.136 --> 00:30:39.971
It's only when you're around.

00:30:45.743 --> 00:30:46.811
Something happened again?

00:30:49.681 --> 00:30:52.116
I want to ditch everything
and run away.

00:30:57.021 --> 00:30:58.356
Run away?

00:31:00.458 --> 00:31:01.559
Is that possible?

00:31:03.461 --> 00:31:04.462
What?

00:31:07.198 --> 00:31:09.500
It doesn't make things disappear.

00:31:10.568 --> 00:31:12.103
It'll come back to you eventually.

00:31:14.539 --> 00:31:15.673
You can get through this.

00:31:26.618 --> 00:31:28.019
Let's go home.

00:31:57.081 --> 00:31:58.449
Yurika.

00:32:02.086 --> 00:32:03.554
Get over here.

00:32:04.722 --> 00:32:05.990
Yurika.

00:32:39.324 --> 00:32:43.995
I'm doing it now.

00:32:55.039 --> 00:32:57.909
I'm doing it now.

00:33:11.956 --> 00:33:12.957
Good night.

00:33:15.360 --> 00:33:16.361
Good night.

00:33:27.739 --> 00:33:33.745
MATERNITY HEALTH RECORDS

00:33:46.724 --> 00:33:50.228
I'm heading that way,
so we can split here.

00:33:50.728 --> 00:33:51.729
Really?

00:33:51.996 --> 00:33:52.997
Yes.

00:33:53.231 --> 00:33:54.265
See you again.

00:34:09.614 --> 00:34:10.615
I'm sorry.

00:34:14.852 --> 00:34:15.853
Goodbye.

00:36:09.834 --> 00:36:10.835
Mitsuhiro.

00:36:14.172 --> 00:36:15.173
Welcome home.

00:38:15.993 --> 00:38:17.194
My husband's return.

00:38:17.261 --> 00:38:18.262
RETURN

00:38:18.629 --> 00:38:20.264
The truth of his disappearance.

00:38:20.331 --> 00:38:21.332
TRUTH

00:38:21.832 --> 00:38:23.301
A crime to be judged.

00:38:23.367 --> 00:38:24.535
CRIME

00:38:25.303 --> 00:38:26.504
Riko's decision.

00:38:26.570 --> 00:38:27.638
DECISION
