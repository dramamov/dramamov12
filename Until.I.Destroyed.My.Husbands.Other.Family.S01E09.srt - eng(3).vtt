WEBVTT

00:00:05.905 --> 00:00:10.010
SEVEN YEARS LATER

00:00:15.882 --> 00:00:19.819
I never got over the pain
of hurting others for my revenge.

00:00:21.821 --> 00:00:23.056
But

00:00:24.190 --> 00:00:25.959
step by step

00:00:28.795 --> 00:00:30.630
I've moved forward.

00:00:38.838 --> 00:00:41.374
Time heals all wounds.

00:00:44.177 --> 00:00:46.479
This peaceful everyday life

00:00:48.281 --> 00:00:49.949
will someday

00:00:51.051 --> 00:00:52.852
let me forget everything.

00:00:57.257 --> 00:00:58.425
Tsubasa.

00:00:59.559 --> 00:01:00.894
Mom.

00:01:03.630 --> 00:01:04.798
Look.

00:01:07.967 --> 00:01:09.369
Nothing here.

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:13.039
My son and I will continue

00:01:14.507 --> 00:01:16.376
to live quietly like this.

00:01:19.846 --> 00:01:21.714
That's what I thought, but...

00:01:32.425 --> 00:01:33.593
I didn't think...

00:01:35.595 --> 00:01:38.131
I'd see you again.

00:02:33.286 --> 00:02:38.458
UNTIL I DESTROYED
MY HUSBAND'S OTHER FAMILY

00:02:38.525 --> 00:02:40.126
- See you. Bye.
- Bye.

00:02:40.193 --> 00:02:43.029
Thank you very much.

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:52.639
- Come here for a minute.
- Ms. Minori.

00:02:52.705 --> 00:02:55.108
- This is so delicious.
- Really?

00:02:55.175 --> 00:02:56.409
It's delicious, isn't it?

00:02:56.476 --> 00:02:58.077
- Isn't it?
- Take your time and enjoy.

00:02:58.144 --> 00:02:59.746
No, not yet.

00:03:00.213 --> 00:03:01.648
That's really good.

00:03:01.714 --> 00:03:03.249
Thank you.

00:03:03.316 --> 00:03:04.584
Can I have some?

00:03:04.651 --> 00:03:05.952
Give me a little.

00:03:06.553 --> 00:03:08.421
Thanks for waiting.

00:03:09.722 --> 00:03:12.258
- You have a very nice café.
- Do you think so?

00:03:13.026 --> 00:03:14.027
Wait.

00:03:14.661 --> 00:03:15.662
Here.

00:03:16.663 --> 00:03:18.965
Sorry, I'm a bit late,
but congratulations.

00:03:19.032 --> 00:03:20.500
Thank you.

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:25.004
For a long time

00:03:25.972 --> 00:03:27.807
I wanted to build a place

00:03:27.874 --> 00:03:31.878
where parents and their kids
can feel safe and relax.

00:03:31.945 --> 00:03:35.081
For me, it feels like
it's finally happened.

00:03:35.682 --> 00:03:38.251
It was received so well,
you were featured in an article.

00:03:40.019 --> 00:03:42.355
When I moved here to Suzuhara

00:03:42.422 --> 00:03:45.124
there weren't any
family-oriented cafés.

00:03:45.592 --> 00:03:47.627
I was lucky to be the first.

00:03:49.295 --> 00:03:51.064
Why did you decide on opening here?

00:03:52.799 --> 00:03:56.236
I visited here with my mom
when I was little.

00:03:56.970 --> 00:04:00.940
Then I visited several times for
a travel seminar at my university.

00:04:01.608 --> 00:04:04.644
There's the ocean nearby,
lots of greenery...

00:04:04.711 --> 00:04:07.313
So I always loved this area.

00:04:08.181 --> 00:04:11.484
People here are helpful
and nice, too.

00:04:15.388 --> 00:04:16.589
You know

00:04:17.857 --> 00:04:20.560
you've been working hard
for a long time on your own.

00:04:21.427 --> 00:04:22.595
Maybe it's time

00:04:23.296 --> 00:04:25.865
to take a step
to find another partner.

00:04:28.334 --> 00:04:29.435
Well...

00:04:30.203 --> 00:04:32.438
But do I deserve to?

00:04:32.505 --> 00:04:34.040
Don't worry.

00:04:34.107 --> 00:04:38.645
If you find someone honest,
I'm sure love can be nurtured.

00:04:40.079 --> 00:04:41.080
You ought to.

00:04:50.857 --> 00:04:53.626
What? Did something happen already?

00:04:53.693 --> 00:04:56.296
No, it's not like that. But...

00:05:03.836 --> 00:05:05.438
Good afternoon.

00:05:05.505 --> 00:05:08.841
- Hello.
- Please come in.

00:05:09.642 --> 00:05:11.577
Hello.

00:05:12.145 --> 00:05:14.447
Oh, Mr. Taguchi. You've come again.

00:05:14.514 --> 00:05:16.516
- Hello.
- Hello.

00:05:16.582 --> 00:05:17.917
- May we?
- Sure. Go ahead.

00:05:17.984 --> 00:05:19.986
Just some tea
before picking up my daughter.

00:05:20.053 --> 00:05:21.521
Mr. Taguchi?

00:05:22.755 --> 00:05:24.424
Your collar...

00:05:25.692 --> 00:05:26.793
What?

00:05:27.827 --> 00:05:30.430
- Oh, no.
- Your shirt still has a tag on it.

00:05:30.496 --> 00:05:31.798
Well...

00:05:31.864 --> 00:05:34.734
I didn't want to look sloppy
in front of Ms. Kume

00:05:34.801 --> 00:05:37.036
but now I look like
I'm trying too hard, don't I?

00:05:37.103 --> 00:05:38.404
- Embarrassing...
- Excuse me.

00:05:38.471 --> 00:05:40.306
Thank you
for being considerate. Wait!

00:05:40.373 --> 00:05:41.541
Wait. Don't.

00:05:41.607 --> 00:05:44.644
Can you be still for a moment?

00:05:50.883 --> 00:05:52.051
Thank you very much.

00:05:53.519 --> 00:05:56.456
Why don't you ask her out?

00:05:56.522 --> 00:05:58.591
You're both single. It's all good.

00:05:58.658 --> 00:06:00.860
Hey, don't make things awkward
for Mr. Taguchi.

00:06:00.927 --> 00:06:02.995
Well, it's not awkward for me.

00:06:04.030 --> 00:06:06.232
Mr. Taguchi, you should ask
for her contact number.

00:06:06.299 --> 00:06:07.600
Well...

00:06:07.667 --> 00:06:09.802
If you don't mind...

00:06:09.869 --> 00:06:11.504
Oh, I might have a business card.

00:06:17.343 --> 00:06:20.747
So, did you
exchange contacts with him?

00:06:20.813 --> 00:06:22.849
Yeah, I kind of went with the flow.

00:06:23.416 --> 00:06:24.984
- Just went with it.
- That's good.

00:06:25.051 --> 00:06:27.186
Sounds like an honest man to me.

00:06:27.253 --> 00:06:28.955
Is he a divorcee, too?

00:06:31.758 --> 00:06:33.726
You should give him a chance.

00:06:35.762 --> 00:06:39.132
But you know,
Tsubasa's at a sensitive age.

00:06:40.066 --> 00:06:41.234
I don't mind.

00:06:43.102 --> 00:06:45.138
Hi, Tsubasa.

00:06:45.204 --> 00:06:48.174
Hi, Mom. The old lady
who lives in the back gave me this.

00:06:48.841 --> 00:06:51.511
Thank you. I should go thank her.

00:06:51.577 --> 00:06:54.647
Tsubasa, you look like you've grown
taller since I saw you last time.

00:06:55.181 --> 00:06:56.516
- Really?
- Yeah.

00:06:57.250 --> 00:06:58.317
Nice seeing you.

00:06:59.252 --> 00:07:00.286
See you.

00:07:06.559 --> 00:07:09.662
He's growing up
watching you work hard.

00:07:09.729 --> 00:07:11.397
You've raised a good boy.

00:07:15.768 --> 00:07:17.870
I've kept a lid on romance.

00:07:21.174 --> 00:07:22.175
But...

00:07:24.210 --> 00:07:26.446
maybe it's okay to consider it.

00:07:26.512 --> 00:07:29.415
- Everybody did a great presentation.
- Yeah.

00:07:29.482 --> 00:07:31.350
It surprised me.

00:07:32.418 --> 00:07:34.821
- They were good.
- Weren't they?

00:07:38.424 --> 00:07:40.793
- Goodbye, sir.
- Goodbye.

00:07:45.932 --> 00:07:48.401
Don't run in the hallway.

00:07:48.468 --> 00:07:49.635
Goodbye.

00:07:51.471 --> 00:07:53.439
You don't have self-training

00:07:53.506 --> 00:07:55.675
but it's three hours a day?

00:07:55.741 --> 00:07:57.443
Does that mean

00:07:57.510 --> 00:07:59.579
you have a training regimen?

00:08:00.313 --> 00:08:03.716
- It depends on that day, but...
- Yes.

00:08:10.223 --> 00:08:12.425
- Goodbye, sir.
- Goodbye.

00:08:42.154 --> 00:08:43.356
Minori.

00:08:46.392 --> 00:08:47.660
Wataru.

00:08:51.230 --> 00:08:52.598
Why are you here?

00:08:55.701 --> 00:08:56.736
I'm...

00:08:57.670 --> 00:09:00.706
teaching here from September.

00:09:07.914 --> 00:09:09.115
Mom.

00:09:16.989 --> 00:09:18.624
Mr. Miyake? Do you have a minute?

00:09:22.228 --> 00:09:24.530
SUZUHARACHO SHIONE
PUBLIC ELEMENTARY SCHOOL

00:09:24.597 --> 00:09:27.233
- You're not coming?
- I'm going to walk home with Wataru.

00:09:27.800 --> 00:09:29.802
- Walking?
- Yeah.

00:09:29.869 --> 00:09:32.271
- Then I'll bring your bag home.
- Okay.

00:09:32.338 --> 00:09:33.639
Sorry for the wait.

00:09:34.373 --> 00:09:36.976
Minori. Do you know Mr. Miyake?

00:09:39.979 --> 00:09:41.414
Do you know him, Haruna?

00:09:41.480 --> 00:09:45.184
He's my daughter's homeroom teacher
starting after the summer break.

00:09:47.119 --> 00:09:48.521
I see.

00:09:49.455 --> 00:09:50.756
Tsubasa.

00:09:53.125 --> 00:09:54.594
I'll see you.

00:09:54.660 --> 00:09:55.828
See you again.

00:09:56.162 --> 00:09:57.396
- It's hot, isn't it?
- Yeah.

00:09:57.964 --> 00:09:59.732
Hello, Emiri.

00:09:59.799 --> 00:10:00.967
Hello.

00:10:01.033 --> 00:10:04.403
Please be good to my father.

00:10:05.004 --> 00:10:06.906
- What?
- Let's walk home together, Tsubasa.

00:10:07.573 --> 00:10:08.574
What?

00:10:11.577 --> 00:10:14.714
Excuse my daughter.
She's kind of mature for her age.

00:10:14.780 --> 00:10:15.982
No.

00:10:16.048 --> 00:10:17.583
It's quite all right.

00:10:18.084 --> 00:10:19.752
- Goodbye, then.
- Goodbye.

00:10:36.569 --> 00:10:37.903
I can't believe it.

00:10:40.773 --> 00:10:42.608
How can a coincidence
like this happen?

00:11:09.568 --> 00:11:12.038
I'm still at school.
I'll call you back when I get home.

00:11:12.505 --> 00:11:15.141
You always say that but you never do.

00:11:15.207 --> 00:11:18.210
Anyway, I still have work to do.
I'm hanging up now.

00:11:20.279 --> 00:11:21.614
When will you be home next?

00:11:21.947 --> 00:11:23.482
I'll be back for summer break.

00:11:24.183 --> 00:11:25.918
That far ahead?

00:11:27.787 --> 00:11:30.489
I want to play with you!

00:11:31.524 --> 00:11:34.226
Sorry, Mom. I'll try to come home
as soon as possible.

00:11:38.297 --> 00:11:40.132
All right. I'll be waiting.

00:11:55.181 --> 00:11:56.449
These seven years

00:11:58.050 --> 00:11:59.518
I tried to not remember.

00:12:00.720 --> 00:12:02.855
About Yudai

00:12:04.323 --> 00:12:06.625
or about Wataru's family.

00:12:09.462 --> 00:12:10.730
They should be

00:12:11.831 --> 00:12:14.567
leading a different life now.

00:12:18.471 --> 00:12:22.208
Okay, let's eat.

00:12:22.274 --> 00:12:24.477
It's lunch time.

00:12:24.543 --> 00:12:26.378
Yes, it is.

00:12:29.014 --> 00:12:30.382
What are you doing after lunch?

00:12:31.016 --> 00:12:32.017
What?

00:12:32.084 --> 00:12:33.652
- Outside work?
- Yeah.

00:12:39.759 --> 00:12:41.761
I don't think you have to.

00:12:41.827 --> 00:12:43.796
I think I do.

00:12:46.298 --> 00:12:47.666
You can have some if you want.

00:12:48.167 --> 00:12:50.870
No. It's all right, thanks.

00:12:53.272 --> 00:12:54.507
Hey.

00:12:55.174 --> 00:12:57.276
You replaced the photo. Nice.

00:12:57.343 --> 00:13:00.579
I thought I could work harder
if I see my kid's face.

00:13:03.682 --> 00:13:04.717
I'm sorry.

00:13:05.918 --> 00:13:06.952
It's fine.

00:13:08.120 --> 00:13:12.124
My son is about that age now.

00:13:17.563 --> 00:13:18.764
You know what?

00:13:19.832 --> 00:13:22.735
My parents are divorced, too.

00:13:23.636 --> 00:13:24.904
When I was about that age

00:13:25.538 --> 00:13:28.240
they let me see my dad
when I told them that I missed him.

00:13:28.974 --> 00:13:29.975
What?

00:13:36.882 --> 00:13:38.184
Tsubasa.

00:13:41.687 --> 00:13:42.955
If only I could see them

00:13:43.956 --> 00:13:45.858
one more time.

00:14:09.181 --> 00:14:12.451
I can't believe
I could see her again.

00:14:36.942 --> 00:14:38.310
Good afternoon.

00:14:56.228 --> 00:14:57.763
It was such a surprise

00:14:58.530 --> 00:15:00.099
to unexpectedly see you yesterday.

00:15:06.839 --> 00:15:08.607
Why did you come to this town?

00:15:09.808 --> 00:15:12.778
I visited here on a travel seminar

00:15:13.779 --> 00:15:16.715
and I liked how
it's surrounded by nature.

00:15:18.284 --> 00:15:19.785
Travel seminar?

00:15:21.720 --> 00:15:22.755
Thanks to you

00:15:23.489 --> 00:15:27.059
I was admitted to the Faculty
of Education at Keiho University.

00:15:30.029 --> 00:15:32.731
So I was the one responsible

00:15:34.633 --> 00:15:36.702
for him choosing this town?

00:15:38.837 --> 00:15:41.173
Then you fulfilled your dream.

00:15:48.147 --> 00:15:49.214
Minori.

00:15:50.683 --> 00:15:51.684
I am now

00:15:52.651 --> 00:15:54.286
twenty-five years old.

00:15:56.322 --> 00:15:58.490
I'm not a child anymore
like I was back then.

00:16:02.661 --> 00:16:03.796
Stop.

00:16:05.965 --> 00:16:08.367
Don't look at me in the same way
you did back then.

00:16:10.836 --> 00:16:12.338
I see.

00:16:13.138 --> 00:16:16.008
I've become an old lady at 40.

00:16:16.842 --> 00:16:19.778
You have your whole life
ahead of you at 25.

00:16:20.846 --> 00:16:22.815
Work, hobbies, romance...

00:16:23.549 --> 00:16:24.984
Enjoy to the fullest, okay?

00:16:29.655 --> 00:16:30.689
Minori.

00:16:32.624 --> 00:16:33.625
I...

00:16:34.927 --> 00:16:37.329
I'm certain now that
we have met again.

00:16:39.565 --> 00:16:40.766
Minori

00:16:41.300 --> 00:16:42.601
I'm certain that I...

00:16:46.772 --> 00:16:48.073
Hello.

00:16:48.140 --> 00:16:49.708
- Good afternoon.
- Hello.

00:16:49.775 --> 00:16:51.143
- Hello.

00:16:51.744 --> 00:16:54.646
Hello, Mr. Miyake.

00:16:54.713 --> 00:16:55.814
Hello.

00:16:55.881 --> 00:16:58.450
Are you working
on a substitute holiday?

00:16:58.517 --> 00:17:00.486
- You're such a hard worker.
- No.

00:17:00.552 --> 00:17:01.687
Not really.

00:17:02.821 --> 00:17:03.856
Ms. Kume.

00:17:04.923 --> 00:17:06.992
What's on the menu for lunch today?

00:17:08.527 --> 00:17:10.696
It's beef stroganoff today.

00:17:11.096 --> 00:17:12.564
What? Is it because--

00:17:12.631 --> 00:17:15.267
Yes. You've requested it in the past
so I tried making it.

00:17:15.334 --> 00:17:17.436
Thank you so much.
I'm excited to try it.

00:17:17.503 --> 00:17:18.904
Please take a seat.

00:17:23.942 --> 00:17:27.446
I have an hour till pick-up time.
Maybe I'll have dessert.

00:17:27.513 --> 00:17:31.250
Mr. Miyake, you're quite popular
among the girls.

00:17:31.316 --> 00:17:33.852
They're saying, a new
handsome teacher has come from Tokyo!

00:17:33.919 --> 00:17:35.454
I don't think that's true.

00:17:35.521 --> 00:17:38.323
I bet your mother is beautiful.

00:17:39.391 --> 00:17:41.393
Not really.

00:17:42.161 --> 00:17:43.862
Do you have any siblings?

00:17:50.469 --> 00:17:52.004
I have one younger sister.

00:17:52.071 --> 00:17:53.939
I'd love to see what she looks like.

00:17:54.006 --> 00:17:55.107
Are you okay?

00:17:56.842 --> 00:17:57.843
What?

00:17:58.343 --> 00:17:59.711
You look pale.

00:18:03.282 --> 00:18:05.284
It feels a bit chilly in here.

00:18:05.884 --> 00:18:07.553
I'll go turn the air conditioner off.

00:18:18.330 --> 00:18:20.799
Oh, she's super cute!

00:18:20.866 --> 00:18:22.534
I totally agree!

00:18:22.601 --> 00:18:24.436
Minori, come look!

00:18:24.503 --> 00:18:25.704
Don't...

00:18:26.738 --> 00:18:30.109
It's a photo of Mr. Miyake's
much younger sister.

00:18:30.409 --> 00:18:31.910
She's so cute!

00:18:31.977 --> 00:18:33.078
Please stop.

00:18:34.746 --> 00:18:35.948
I don't want to see it!

00:18:49.595 --> 00:18:51.363
Look how cute she is!

00:18:55.234 --> 00:18:56.435
See?

00:18:57.769 --> 00:18:58.904
I see.

00:18:59.271 --> 00:19:00.472
What's her name?

00:19:02.174 --> 00:19:04.643
- Reika.
- How do you write it?

00:19:05.277 --> 00:19:07.446
Rei as in "beautiful,"
and Ka as in "fragrance."

00:19:07.513 --> 00:19:09.548
It's perfect for her.

00:19:09.615 --> 00:19:11.316
Don't you think so, Minori?

00:19:12.117 --> 00:19:13.452
Yeah, it is.

00:19:13.719 --> 00:19:16.622
She looks like a Reika.

00:19:20.259 --> 00:19:21.960
I didn't want to know...

00:19:24.163 --> 00:19:25.697
about this child.

00:19:34.306 --> 00:19:36.275
- Gosh.
- Minori.

00:19:38.343 --> 00:19:40.846
Are you all right?
I think there was a dustpan outside.

00:19:40.913 --> 00:19:42.080
Let's go get it.

00:19:44.950 --> 00:19:47.619
The daughter of Yudai and that woman.

00:19:48.287 --> 00:19:49.855
She's the same as me.

00:19:51.256 --> 00:19:52.724
A child of adultery.

00:19:54.526 --> 00:19:56.261
Tsubasa's half-sister.

00:20:00.432 --> 00:20:02.167
Are you okay?

00:20:03.268 --> 00:20:05.137
Thank you.

00:20:05.871 --> 00:20:07.139
Do you have bandages?

00:20:07.940 --> 00:20:10.943
- In the first aid kit.
- I'll go get it.

00:20:31.363 --> 00:20:32.531
Does it hurt?

00:20:33.832 --> 00:20:36.268
- There.
- Thank you so much.

00:20:37.536 --> 00:20:38.637
No problem.

00:20:50.816 --> 00:20:52.517
Mom.

00:20:54.052 --> 00:20:55.320
What is it?

00:20:56.288 --> 00:20:57.689
Come here.

00:20:59.291 --> 00:21:00.459
What's the matter?

00:21:01.360 --> 00:21:03.462
I don't know how to do this.

00:21:04.630 --> 00:21:07.299
Self-study?

00:21:07.366 --> 00:21:09.534
"Try researching something you like."

00:21:10.302 --> 00:21:11.637
How about a diary?

00:21:11.703 --> 00:21:14.940
There's nothing to write
since my brother is not here.

00:21:15.340 --> 00:21:18.410
You're so attached
to your big brother, aren't you?

00:21:18.477 --> 00:21:22.981
You say you miss him
all the time, too.

00:21:26.318 --> 00:21:29.621
Oh, I got a great idea.

00:21:30.856 --> 00:21:33.292
Let's do research
about the town he lives in.

00:21:34.259 --> 00:21:36.395
You said you wanted to go there,
didn't you?

00:21:36.461 --> 00:21:38.363
I think you want to go
more than me, Mom.

00:21:38.430 --> 00:21:41.833
But I want to meet him too,
so I'll do it.

00:21:42.868 --> 00:21:44.069
Okay then.

00:21:44.136 --> 00:21:47.339
I'll help you find
information online.

00:21:50.642 --> 00:21:56.181
SUZUHARA ATTRACTIONS

00:21:56.248 --> 00:21:58.650
SEARCH

00:21:58.717 --> 00:21:59.785
SUZUHARA ATTRACTIONS

00:22:07.225 --> 00:22:08.260
What?

00:22:09.895 --> 00:22:11.897
- Thank you.
- Thank you for the meal.

00:22:15.400 --> 00:22:18.637
We'll be going now, Mr. Taguchi.

00:22:21.773 --> 00:22:23.775
- We'll come again.
- Thank you.

00:22:23.842 --> 00:22:25.911
- Thank you for the meal.
- Thank you.

00:22:31.350 --> 00:22:33.952
I guess they're
being considerate towards us.

00:22:34.686 --> 00:22:35.921
I guess so.

00:22:37.055 --> 00:22:38.056
Excuse me.

00:22:40.826 --> 00:22:42.994
I have to go back to work now

00:22:44.396 --> 00:22:45.964
so I'll get straight to the point.

00:22:49.935 --> 00:22:51.036
Minori.

00:22:52.637 --> 00:22:53.705
Would you

00:22:55.273 --> 00:22:57.442
go out on a date with me?

00:23:08.153 --> 00:23:09.354
I'd be happy to.

00:23:10.021 --> 00:23:11.256
If it's really all right.

00:23:12.090 --> 00:23:13.558
Thank you.

00:23:13.625 --> 00:23:15.861
I'll contact you again soon.

00:23:15.927 --> 00:23:17.629
I'll be looking forward to it.
Take care.

00:23:17.696 --> 00:23:18.897
Yes.

00:23:21.299 --> 00:23:23.135
Mr. Miyake.

00:23:24.035 --> 00:23:26.204
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye.

00:23:27.806 --> 00:23:28.940
It was delicious.

00:23:30.075 --> 00:23:31.710
Thank you.

00:23:45.724 --> 00:23:49.027
- Thank you for the meal.
- Thank you.

00:24:22.794 --> 00:24:24.162
Did you forget something?

00:24:25.931 --> 00:24:26.998
No.

00:24:29.301 --> 00:24:30.368
Hey.

00:24:32.337 --> 00:24:34.973
Could you please
not come here anymore?

00:24:37.075 --> 00:24:38.143
What?

00:24:42.180 --> 00:24:43.248
Have you noticed?

00:24:44.749 --> 00:24:46.017
Just now

00:24:47.018 --> 00:24:50.689
you called me "Minori"
in front of everyone.

00:24:53.525 --> 00:24:54.693
I'm sorry.

00:24:57.195 --> 00:24:58.597
It's a small town.

00:24:59.931 --> 00:25:01.933
I don't want any rumors going around.

00:25:08.507 --> 00:25:09.608
Please keep in mind.

00:25:11.443 --> 00:25:15.046
From now on, we are
only a teacher and a parent.

00:25:18.216 --> 00:25:19.217
Goodbye.

00:25:38.403 --> 00:25:40.539
Are you really going on a date
with Mr. Taguchi?

00:25:41.907 --> 00:25:44.175
That has nothing to do with you,
Mr. Miyake.

00:25:44.242 --> 00:25:45.343
It does.

00:25:46.511 --> 00:25:49.748
- Minori, I...
- Mr. Miyake.

00:25:53.084 --> 00:25:54.152
My hope is

00:25:55.453 --> 00:25:58.990
to lead a new life here.

00:26:01.493 --> 00:26:02.594
Right now

00:26:04.629 --> 00:26:07.566
I want to know more
about Mr. Taguchi.

00:26:16.308 --> 00:26:17.509
Tsubasa.

00:26:18.643 --> 00:26:19.778
Hi, Tsubasa.

00:26:23.982 --> 00:26:25.150
Mr. Miyake.

00:26:26.885 --> 00:26:29.788
I thought I forgot my umbrella here.

00:26:29.854 --> 00:26:31.790
I was telling him it's not here.

00:26:32.857 --> 00:26:33.925
I see.

00:26:36.027 --> 00:26:40.599
I'm going home now.
I'll see you at school.

00:26:40.665 --> 00:26:41.967
Take care.

00:26:59.250 --> 00:27:01.319
- I'll make dinner right away.
- Okay.

00:27:26.144 --> 00:27:30.915
WE ARE CLOSED TODAY

00:27:44.863 --> 00:27:47.766
You're going on a date
with Taguchi's father today, right?

00:27:48.767 --> 00:27:51.469
- Why?
- Taguchi told me.

00:27:52.871 --> 00:27:54.005
I see.

00:27:54.072 --> 00:27:56.374
I got soccer practice,
so don't worry.

00:27:59.344 --> 00:28:00.378
Okay.

00:28:01.846 --> 00:28:03.114
I'm going now.

00:28:03.581 --> 00:28:04.783
I'll see you later.

00:28:16.828 --> 00:28:19.564
That's how he sent me off.

00:28:20.298 --> 00:28:21.533
I'm glad.

00:28:23.535 --> 00:28:24.636
My daughter, Emiri

00:28:25.870 --> 00:28:28.206
is always telling me

00:28:29.207 --> 00:28:30.475
to hurry up and find a new partner.

00:28:30.542 --> 00:28:33.144
She's worried about me being alone.

00:28:35.013 --> 00:28:37.015
Emiri is a kind girl, isn't she?

00:28:39.250 --> 00:28:40.351
I think

00:28:41.753 --> 00:28:45.223
she wants somebody to talk to
about things she can't tell her dad.

00:28:47.992 --> 00:28:49.661
She's a girl after all.

00:28:49.728 --> 00:28:51.396
I think I understand.

00:28:55.233 --> 00:28:56.234
Well...

00:28:59.838 --> 00:29:01.773
it might not be appropriate

00:29:02.607 --> 00:29:04.209
to be telling you this already...

00:29:06.578 --> 00:29:07.779
But it's been

00:29:08.747 --> 00:29:11.216
six years since my divorce.

00:29:13.051 --> 00:29:14.285
It was due to

00:29:15.386 --> 00:29:16.821
usual reasons for divorce.

00:29:17.589 --> 00:29:19.090
We had different values.

00:29:23.361 --> 00:29:25.964
She neglected our child
and often went out drinking.

00:29:26.965 --> 00:29:28.800
I gradually couldn't deal with it.

00:29:31.936 --> 00:29:33.738
I'm sorry to subject you to this.

00:29:33.805 --> 00:29:36.040
No, it's all right.

00:29:41.446 --> 00:29:42.480
Well...

00:29:46.651 --> 00:29:47.886
I'm sorry

00:29:48.720 --> 00:29:50.421
but I think...

00:29:53.725 --> 00:29:56.327
I'm not suitable for you after all.

00:29:57.896 --> 00:29:59.230
What?

00:30:00.932 --> 00:30:02.133
I'm really grateful

00:30:02.600 --> 00:30:04.369
for you treating me kindly.

00:30:05.436 --> 00:30:06.671
Which is all the more...

00:30:11.976 --> 00:30:13.344
Is it okay...

00:30:15.280 --> 00:30:17.582
if I tell you all about myself?

00:30:25.023 --> 00:30:26.624
I divorced my ex-husband...

00:30:31.429 --> 00:30:33.097
because he had an affair

00:30:36.067 --> 00:30:39.504
and the woman became pregnant
with his child.

00:30:45.343 --> 00:30:48.513
I'm sorry I made you recall
such a painful memory.

00:30:50.682 --> 00:30:51.950
There's another reason.

00:30:55.119 --> 00:30:56.688
So I decided...

00:30:58.489 --> 00:30:59.791
to take revenge

00:31:01.960 --> 00:31:03.094
on my ex-husband.

00:31:07.365 --> 00:31:09.434
I wanted to punish him.

00:31:13.204 --> 00:31:16.040
Why did you cheat on me?

00:31:16.941 --> 00:31:20.745
I can cut ties with you
without any regrets.

00:31:20.812 --> 00:31:23.848
How do you feel
losing your precious family?

00:31:34.726 --> 00:31:37.195
I am actually...

00:31:39.030 --> 00:31:41.866
a person with a very black heart.

00:31:43.368 --> 00:31:44.502
That's why

00:31:45.136 --> 00:31:47.071
I'm not worthy of someone like you.

00:31:50.041 --> 00:31:51.242
I'm sorry.

00:31:53.645 --> 00:31:54.879
Minori.

00:31:56.514 --> 00:31:58.549
I see you were hurt a whole lot.

00:32:05.356 --> 00:32:07.558
Someone with a truly black heart

00:32:08.559 --> 00:32:11.663
wouldn't suffer like you.

00:32:13.965 --> 00:32:15.066
You shouldn't...

00:32:16.601 --> 00:32:18.503
be so hard on yourself anymore.

00:32:29.781 --> 00:32:30.949
Well...

00:32:31.649 --> 00:32:33.584
There's something on my mind.

00:32:35.553 --> 00:32:37.989
May I ask you one further question?

00:32:41.159 --> 00:32:42.393
What is it?

00:32:45.530 --> 00:32:46.965
What is your relationship

00:32:48.232 --> 00:32:49.867
with Mr. Miyake?

00:32:54.339 --> 00:32:55.540
I'm sorry

00:32:56.708 --> 00:32:59.844
you just didn't seem like
a teacher and a parent.

00:33:04.315 --> 00:33:09.320
Seven years ago,
when I was still living in Tokyo

00:33:09.387 --> 00:33:11.990
I was his tutor at a cram school.

00:33:14.425 --> 00:33:15.593
You mean

00:33:16.427 --> 00:33:19.564
when he was in high school?

00:33:19.630 --> 00:33:23.468
Yes. We were both surprised
to have met again by chance.

00:33:24.335 --> 00:33:28.873
To avoid misunderstandings,
I asked him to act like strangers.

00:33:31.075 --> 00:33:32.543
I see.

00:33:37.148 --> 00:33:38.216
Anyway...

00:33:40.284 --> 00:33:42.453
thank you for telling me.

00:33:43.721 --> 00:33:44.722
Bye then.

00:33:56.000 --> 00:34:00.605
SUZUHARACHO SHIONE
PUBLIC ELEMENTARY SCHOOL

00:34:00.671 --> 00:34:05.276
FIRE HYDRANT

00:34:05.343 --> 00:34:08.846
I WANT TO TALK TO YOU AGAIN.
MAY I COME TO THE CAFE?

00:34:13.551 --> 00:34:14.552
Minori.

00:34:19.057 --> 00:34:21.859
Thank you for honestly telling me
about your past hardships.

00:34:23.728 --> 00:34:27.298
It made me like you even more.

00:34:33.471 --> 00:34:38.576
I promise I won't ever do anything
that makes you sad.

00:34:44.649 --> 00:34:45.783
Would you consider

00:34:47.318 --> 00:34:48.920
a serious relationship with me

00:34:49.754 --> 00:34:51.322
with marriage in mind?

00:34:56.127 --> 00:34:58.696
- Her drawing is getting better.
- Isn't it?

00:34:58.763 --> 00:35:00.565
I might let her take an art class.

00:35:00.631 --> 00:35:03.468
- Sounds good.
- Thank you for waiting.

00:35:04.035 --> 00:35:06.070
This is sesame chiffon cake

00:35:06.137 --> 00:35:08.406
and this is sake lees chiffon cake.

00:35:08.473 --> 00:35:11.142
Mr. Miyake is a regular now,
isn't he?

00:35:15.580 --> 00:35:18.416
By the way, how is it going
with Mr. Taguchi?

00:35:19.083 --> 00:35:21.152
Did he confess his love yet?

00:35:23.521 --> 00:35:25.590
Oh, he did.

00:35:25.890 --> 00:35:26.891
And?

00:35:27.525 --> 00:35:28.759
Well...

00:35:29.494 --> 00:35:32.597
I said I wanted to
think about it for a while.

00:35:36.501 --> 00:35:38.269
I am thankful, though.

00:35:38.336 --> 00:35:39.537
Yes!

00:35:39.604 --> 00:35:40.738
Please.

00:35:41.405 --> 00:35:42.773
Sorry.

00:35:42.840 --> 00:35:45.009
Don't you think
they're a perfect couple?

00:35:46.611 --> 00:35:47.745
What?

00:35:50.248 --> 00:35:51.415
I don't know.

00:35:57.355 --> 00:35:59.323
- Thank you.
- Thank you for the meal.

00:35:59.390 --> 00:36:00.892
Thank you.

00:36:03.094 --> 00:36:05.129
It's so hot.

00:36:05.196 --> 00:36:08.065
Thanks. The café is closed now.

00:36:08.132 --> 00:36:09.467
We're going home.

00:36:09.534 --> 00:36:12.170
Please come again.

00:36:12.236 --> 00:36:13.905
- High five.
- Bye- bye.

00:36:13.971 --> 00:36:15.806
Can't we stay a little longer?

00:36:15.873 --> 00:36:17.542
See you again.

00:36:18.442 --> 00:36:21.379
- Ms. Kume.
- Mr. Miyake.

00:36:21.445 --> 00:36:22.813
Thank you very much.

00:36:30.221 --> 00:36:31.355
Wataru.

00:36:44.936 --> 00:36:46.304
It's been a while.

00:36:48.739 --> 00:36:49.941
Mom.

00:37:19.170 --> 00:37:20.404
Just like I thought.

00:37:21.138 --> 00:37:23.541
That woman and Wataru
were in contact.

00:37:32.650 --> 00:37:35.486
After I was punished by her

00:37:36.087 --> 00:37:38.723
I lived quietly until now.

00:37:40.091 --> 00:37:42.026
But that woman...

00:37:44.128 --> 00:37:47.632
She secretly got close to Wataru
without me knowing.

00:37:49.834 --> 00:37:51.435
You'd better brace yourself.

00:37:56.107 --> 00:37:57.708
Why is she here?

00:38:01.412 --> 00:38:04.048
I'll never forgive her.

00:38:07.652 --> 00:38:10.354
I heard the sound of my peaceful life

00:38:13.057 --> 00:38:15.393
crumbling to the ground.

00:38:22.433 --> 00:38:24.669
I'll cut ties with you, Mom.

00:38:24.735 --> 00:38:27.004
I want you to do something for me.

00:38:27.071 --> 00:38:28.873
What do you want me to do?

00:38:28.939 --> 00:38:31.375
Do you remember the promise you made?

00:38:31.442 --> 00:38:33.878
I only did it to use you.

00:38:33.944 --> 00:38:35.246
I can't help myself

00:38:35.746 --> 00:38:37.548
from loving you, Minori.

00:38:37.948 --> 00:38:41.619
Is it my turn to be punished?
