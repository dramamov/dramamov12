10:34.159 --> 10:36.067

10:36.069 --> 10:39.766

Any snags?
- (man) Nope.

19:36.367 --> 19:37.706
You sure?

19:37.708 --> 19:40.970
She was where you said she'd be,
coming out of the pharmacy.

19:40.972 --> 19:43.981
Grabbed her in the alley. No one
saw shit.

19:43.983 --> 19:45.447
You didn't feed her, did ya?

19:46.953 --> 19:48.945
Course not. Think I'm an idiot?

You're not gonna say thank you?

For what?

ass?

20:07.702 --> 20:10.469
Digging your truck out of the
snow?

20:10.471 --> 20:14.704
You'd still be out there
freezing your tits off if I
hadn't gone looking for you.

20:14.706 --> 20:19.213
What the fuck? I said no booze!

20:19.215 --> 20:23.385
I'm not fucking around! You can
get as drunk as you want when
we're done.

20:23.387 --> 20:25.948
I'm not drunk!
- (woman) Enough!

20:25.950 --> 20:28.751
I'm gonna rest while you sober

23:21.659 --> 23:23.768
Um, a mitten?

23:23.770 --> 23:26.668
Yeah, I know it's a fucking
mitten. Where'd it come from?

23:28.134 --> 23:30.966
The mitten store?
- Are you trying to piss me off?

23:30.968 --> 23:33.407
Whose is it?
- I don't know.

23:33.409 --> 23:37.341
A lady stopped by. She maybe
dropped it. - A fucking lady
stopped by?

23:37.343 --> 23:40.910
Yeah, some dumb old bitch. - You
didn't think that was pertinent?

23:40.912 --> 23:45.352
It was two seconds. She didn't
see shit. - Well, she clearly
fucking did!

23:45.354 --> 23:46.588
What did she want?

23:46.590 --> 23:48.459
I gave her directions to the
lake.

23:51.759 --> 23:56.792
I don't know how many times I
have to tell you to stop being
so nice to people.

23:56.794 --> 23:58.698
They take advantage.

23:58.700 --> 24:00.796
Well, she was lost.
- Come on!

24:00.798 --> 24:02.404
Well, where are we going?

27:12.094 --> 27:15.529
No, no, no, no.
I'm not leavin' you, sweetie.

27:15.531 --> 27:17.663
I'm not leavin' ya.

27:17.665 --> 27:19.633
A promise is a promise.

27:19.635 --> 27:23.773
I'm just gonna find something to
get you out of those cuffs. Just
hang tight now.

27:28.773 --> 27:29.812
Oh...

27:33.711 --> 27:34.410
Oh!

27:47.024 --> 27:49.095
(haunting, tense music)

28:36.007 --> 28:37.913
(She groans, pants)

28:40.550 --> 28:42.214
(gunshot)
- Aagh!

28:44.148 --> 28:46.218
(gunshot)
- Oh!

28:47.918 --> 28:49.485
(gunshot)

28:54.397 --> 28:56.162
(panting)

29:02.099 --> 29:04.500
(Woman sighs, pants)

29:08.873 --> 29:10.077
Oh, agh...

29:11.150 --> 29:12.145
Agh...

29:15.550 --> 29:16.985
(gunshot)

29:19.587 --> 29:21.484
(gunshot)

29:24.663 --> 29:27.897
(Gun clicks)
Who the fuck is this cow?

29:36.901 --> 29:38.340
Jesus!

29:38.342 --> 29:39.535
Fuck!

29:45.349 --> 29:46.883
Shit!

29:47.748 --> 29:49.985
(Woman gasps)

29:52.049 --> 29:54.523
(Woman pants)

29:54.525 --> 29:57.220
(Girl pants anxiously)

29:57.222 --> 29:59.390
It's fuckin' freezin' in here.

29:59.392 --> 30:01.764
Do we have any more matches?
- The cupboard.

30:01.766 --> 30:04.760
I'm checking the fucking
cupboard!

30:04.762 --> 30:07.732
Oh, goddamn it, where's our
bags? - (Man groans)

30:07.734 --> 30:08.806
Bitch!

30:10.176 --> 30:11.639
Fuck!

30:11.641 --> 30:13.272
Look for something dry!

30:14.646 --> 30:17.480
There's got to be something.

30:17.482 --> 30:21.913
Maybe I'll just take a hot bath.
- No, you're hypothermic. It'll
kill you.

30:21.915 --> 30:25.087
We need to strip you down and
warm you up slowly with a dry
heat.

30:25.089 --> 30:27.917
There's blankets in my truck.
Fucking-A right!

30:27.919 --> 30:29.585
(panting)

30:36.930 --> 30:39.364
(She pants more loudly)

30:40.900 --> 30:42.598
(She whimpers)

30:46.036 --> 30:48.406
(panting)

30:51.009 --> 30:52.916
(She whimpers)

30:54.814 --> 30:56.920
(panting)

31:08.092 --> 31:10.359
Uff da. (sniffs)

31:10.361 --> 31:12.067
(Bird squawks)
Oh...

31:16.506 --> 31:18.568
(groaning)

31:29.452 --> 31:30.349
Oh!

31:31.720 --> 31:33.852
Eeh! (panting)

31:33.854 --> 31:36.619
(She groans)

31:40.532 --> 31:43.058
(panting) Oh, oh!

31:43.060 --> 31:45.194
Oh... Oh!

31:45.196 --> 31:47.102
(panting heavily)

31:53.204 --> 31:56.511
(groaning and panting)

31:56.513 --> 31:57.673
Oh, oh...

31:58.549 --> 32:00.676
Oh! Uh, uh...

32:04.215 --> 32:05.956
(breathing heavily)

32:12.523 --> 32:14.657
(wind whistling)
- (She groans)

32:24.201 --> 32:26.141
(She whimpers)

32:33.143 --> 32:35.348
(panting)

32:36.180 --> 32:38.455
Oh! (sniffs)

32:38.457 --> 32:40.353
(She sighs)

32:42.759 --> 32:46.856
(Karl) Hey, do me a favor and
grab me one of those grub-barb
lures.

32:46.858 --> 32:49.461
Should be in the tackle box
in the bottom left.

32:53.433 --> 32:55.731
Why, did your legs stop working?
- Hmm?

32:57.906 --> 32:59.735
(soft music playing)

33:39.143 --> 33:40.314
Will you?

33:58.428 --> 34:00.796
(She chuckles softly)

34:01.772 --> 34:03.667
(She sniffs, sighs)

34:10.274 --> 34:12.641
(She groans)

34:12.643 --> 34:15.415
(wind whistling)
- (She groans)

34:20.284 --> 34:22.389
(She sighs)

34:23.287 --> 34:25.260
(She grunts)

34:27.899 --> 34:29.825
You gotta be kiddin' me.
(sniffs)

34:36.070 --> 34:38.141
(She grunts, sighs)

34:47.048 --> 34:49.179
(She grunts loudly)

34:49.181 --> 34:51.121
(wind whistling)

34:54.889 --> 34:56.852
(panting)

35:09.268 --> 35:10.866
(engine rumbling)

35:30.728 --> 35:33.625
(She groans)

35:37.461 --> 35:39.329
Fuck!
- Oh...

35:39.331 --> 35:40.830
We're running out of time.

35:42.140 --> 35:46.204
I've got pins and needles in my
skin.

35:46.206 --> 35:50.312
You need to get your ass in gear
and get all the supplies down to
the lake.

35:50.314 --> 35:52.544
Get everything set up.
(Engine stops)

35:52.546 --> 35:55.246
Right now? I'm... I'm freezing,
though.

35:55.248 --> 35:58.280
We don't have a choice.

35:58.282 --> 36:02.318
Just give me a feckin' minute
here. My clothes ain't even dry.

36:02.320 --> 36:05.921
There ain't fucking time. We
need to get to Littlefork by
morning!

36:08.158 --> 36:11.964
You know what happens
if we miss this fucking surgeon.

36:11.966 --> 36:13.261
O-OK.

36:13.263 --> 36:14.636
OK.

36:14.638 --> 36:15.771
OK.

36:15.773 --> 36:17.702
(wind whistling)

36:20.641 --> 36:23.939
(man) Why don't we just do it
here?

36:23.941 --> 36:27.275
The environment needs to be
pristine.

36:27.277 --> 36:31.920
Well, let's just clean it
and get some bleach and shit.

36:31.922 --> 36:35.687
Which one of us spent the last
fucking decade working in an
O.R.?

36:36.753 --> 36:38.759
Yeah...
- I know what I'm doing.

36:38.761 --> 36:42.694
Plus, I can't have her bleeding
all over my grandma's cabin.

36:43.894 --> 36:46.461
We're doing it on the lake for a
reason.

36:46.463 --> 36:48.399
I know, but...

36:48.401 --> 36:52.968
The cops can't investigate a
crime scene that isn't gonna
exist tomorrow.

36:54.041 --> 36:55.206
Yeah?

36:55.208 --> 36:56.373
(man) Mm-hm.

36:56.375 --> 36:58.212
Where's it gonna go?

36:58.214 --> 36:59.942
(groans) Bottom of the lake.

37:01.186 --> 37:05.183
(sighs) Once we... torch and
sink it.

37:05.185 --> 37:06.289
(woman) Exactly.

37:08.685 --> 37:10.452
(Man groans)
- Hey.

37:10.454 --> 37:12.361
(Man groans)

37:13.724 --> 37:15.463
I really need you right now.

37:21.668 --> 37:23.639
(She sighs)
- Where are you goin'?

37:23.641 --> 37:26.601
I'm goin' to get the girl.
She's not safe here any more.

37:26.603 --> 37:29.738
Then I'll find that bitch and
put a bullet in her fucking
head!

37:29.740 --> 37:31.809
(footsteps going downstairs)

37:34.282 --> 37:36.011
(suspenseful
music playing)

37:39.717 --> 37:42.017
(groaning)
- (Door creaks)

37:53.167 --> 37:55.036
(woman) Get in.

37:55.038 --> 37:56.933
(He grunts, sighs)

38:06.510 --> 38:08.043
(man) Holy shit!

38:14.089 --> 38:15.657
Where's my gun?

38:15.659 --> 38:19.558
You are such a goddamn moron,
it defies believability!

38:19.560 --> 38:21.760
It's not my fault, babe. I
just...

38:21.762 --> 38:24.165
Ow! - Stop feeling sorry for
yourself!

38:24.167 --> 38:27.228
(He groans)
- Move!

38:27.230 --> 38:30.138
I'll bring her to the lake
when you're set up.

38:30.140 --> 38:32.237
(Door slams)
- Fuck!

38:32.239 --> 38:34.273
(Engine revs)

38:34.275 --> 38:36.071
(tense music playing)

38:56.329 --> 38:58.093
(Man groans)

39:04.534 --> 39:06.607
(clanking)

39:08.577 --> 39:10.611
(Barb) What the heck is he
doin'?

39:16.383 --> 39:18.514
(vehicle approaching)

39:18.516 --> 39:20.456
(engine revving)

39:22.586 --> 39:24.388
(She groans)

39:24.390 --> 39:25.857
(Door closes)

39:28.230 --> 39:30.125
(She grunts, pants)

39:32.562 --> 39:34.701
(panting)

39:40.274 --> 39:42.637
(Door creaks)

39:42.639 --> 39:44.711
(Door closes)

39:45.476 --> 39:46.845
Hon? Hon?

39:52.582 --> 39:54.556
(panting)

40:03.627 --> 40:04.962
(She groans)

40:09.302 --> 40:10.473
Oh, yeah.

40:14.672 --> 40:16.908
(She sighs, groans)

40:18.442 --> 40:19.641
Oh!

40:19.643 --> 40:21.583
(She sighs)

40:22.347 --> 40:23.178
Oh!

40:24.352 --> 40:26.181
(She groans softly)

40:30.654 --> 40:32.561
(She gulps)

40:37.968 --> 40:39.865
(groaning)

40:44.039 --> 40:45.101
God!

40:51.511 --> 40:53.849
(She takes deep breath)

40:53.851 --> 40:54.781
Aaargh!

40:55.845 --> 40:58.686
(She groans, whimpers)

41:03.125 --> 41:04.258
God...

41:04.260 --> 41:06.188
(She sighs deeply)

41:10.298 --> 41:12.227
(panting softly)

41:21.507 --> 41:23.139
Steady. Come on.

41:30.219 --> 41:32.115
(She groans)

41:34.686 --> 41:37.494
(She pants, groans)

41:46.104 --> 41:47.966
(She sniffs, sighs)

41:48.832 --> 41:50.639
(panting) Jeez...

41:52.902 --> 41:55.236
Just like sewing a quilt.

41:55.238 --> 42:00.215
(groans) A really gross, bloody
quilt.

42:00.217 --> 42:02.480
(She groans, whimpers)

42:02.482 --> 42:04.953
(She gasps)

42:04.955 --> 42:05.918
Aagh...

42:07.884 --> 42:10.021
(She sobs, whimpers)

42:11.921 --> 42:14.828
(She breathes sharply)

42:18.470 --> 42:21.201
Oh, boy. Come on, come on. Come
on.

42:21.203 --> 42:23.298
(panting)

42:28.245 --> 42:30.540
(She groans sharply)

42:30.542 --> 42:32.615
(panting)

42:34.746 --> 42:37.686
(She groans loudly)

42:39.453 --> 42:41.316
(She whimpers)

42:45.757 --> 42:47.663
(groaning sharply)

42:56.634 --> 42:58.333
(panting)

43:00.475 --> 43:02.337
(Scissors clatter)

43:04.741 --> 43:06.341
(groaning)

43:13.419 --> 43:14.916
Aagh...

43:14.918 --> 43:17.319
(Glasses clatter)

43:22.299 --> 43:24.227
(She sighs softly)

43:32.209 --> 43:33.940
(wind whistling)

43:48.852 --> 43:51.292
(She grunts)

43:51.294 --> 43:53.589
(sighs) Oh!

43:53.591 --> 43:54.730
Oh, oh.

43:56.167 --> 43:58.096

Oh!

44:12.645 --> 44:14.981
(She grunts)

44:18.353 --> 44:19.249
Of course.

44:21.388 --> 44:23.050
Oh!

44:23.052 --> 44:25.387
(breathes sharply) Oh!

44:26.660 --> 44:28.824
(She grunts loudly)

44:28.826 --> 44:30.227
Uff da. Oh!

44:34.833 --> 44:36.739
(radio crackling)

44:39.475 --> 44:41.771
(She sniffs, pants)

44:41.773 --> 44:44.047
God... dang it!

44:44.049 --> 44:44.945
Hello!

44:45.977 --> 44:48.416
Hello?
(crackling)

44:48.418 --> 44:50.253
Anyone out there?

44:50.255 --> 44:52.549
It's an emergency.

44:52.551 --> 44:53.448
Anyone?

44:54.951 --> 44:57.287
Please! Hello!

44:58.691 --> 45:00.928
Hello. Hello...

45:00.930 --> 45:04.566
Frickin'... fiddlesticks! Shit
buns!

45:04.568 --> 45:05.560
(male voice)<i> Whoa there!</i>

45:05.562 --> 45:08.204
<i> I'm sure it can't be</i>
<i> as bad as all that.</i>

45:08.206 --> 45:12.673
Oh, hello. Can you hear me?-
Loud and clear. What's the
trouble?

45:12.675 --> 45:15.503
Oh! There's been a kidnapping.

45:15.505 --> 45:18.439
These two loonies, they took
this girl.

45:18.441 --> 45:21.876
I... I need help. I'm wounded
and I...

45:21.878 --> 45:25.048
<i> Slow down. Slow down there.</i>
<i> What's your location?</i>

45:25.050 --> 45:29.450
Uh, a cabin near Lake Hilda.

45:29.452 --> 45:31.457
<i> Lake what now?</i>
<i> </i> - Hilda!

45:31.459 --> 45:35.257
It's off of Route 11. It's
just... It's south a few
miles...

45:35.259 --> 45:37.692
Uh, just outside Beltrami
County.

45:37.694 --> 45:40.732
OK, yeah, I... I think we might
<i> not be too far...</i>

45:40.734 --> 45:42.304
OK, can you just get...

45:42.306 --> 45:44.169
(She screams)

45:46.839 --> 45:49.042
(grunting and groaning)

45:49.807 --> 45:50.807
Oh, fuck!

45:50.809 --> 45:53.716
Aagh! Fuck!

45:53.718 --> 45:57.386
(She grunts)
- Oh, fucking hell!

45:57.388 --> 46:00.354
(groans) Oh, fuck!

46:00.356 --> 46:01.621
Aagh!

46:01.623 --> 46:04.127
Oh, fuck. Don't, don't...

46:04.129 --> 46:07.225
Don't kill me. Please don't kill
me. - Why are you doing this?

46:07.959 --> 46:09.827
It's my... my wife.

46:09.829 --> 46:11.493
She made me do it.

46:12.931 --> 46:14.529
I didn't want any...

46:15.439 --> 46:17.406
She... she's sick.

46:17.408 --> 46:18.533
And th-that girl...

46:19.707 --> 46:22.339
She tried to kill herself

46:23.006 --> 46:25.414
more than once.

46:25.416 --> 46:27.211
She don't wanna live.

46:27.213 --> 46:30.480
Maybe... Maybe she don't deserve
to.

46:30.482 --> 46:33.081
Well, that's not really up to
you now, is it?

46:33.083 --> 46:36.183
I ain't a bad... person.

46:36.185 --> 46:37.752
I ain't... Please don't...

46:37.754 --> 46:41.358
All right, all right, cut it
out. - (He whimpers)

46:42.831 --> 46:45.164
Oh!
- (He groans loudly)

46:46.800 --> 46:49.102
(He mutters indistinctly)

46:50.199 --> 46:52.201
Where'd she take the girl?

46:52.203 --> 46:55.002
Out looking
for... for you.

46:55.004 --> 46:57.512
(panting)

46:57.514 --> 47:00.207
I was gonna... l-leave

47:00.209 --> 47:04.117
and... go to the hospital.

47:05.456 --> 47:08.052
I'm... I'm hypothermic.

47:08.054 --> 47:11.388
I'm done help... helping her.

47:13.156 --> 47:15.497
I just... I just need

47:15.499 --> 47:19.496
to get to... a doctor.

47:19.498 --> 47:23.164
Stop that. Stop that.
Don't move. Don't move!

47:23.166 --> 47:24.874
(panting rapidly)

47:28.037 --> 47:29.076
Is this...

47:30.479 --> 47:31.612
yours?

47:31.614 --> 47:34.081
Oh! (breathing heavily)

47:36.986 --> 47:39.988
Oh!
- I found it... in the cabin.

47:41.217 --> 47:43.222
(soft music playing)

47:52.765 --> 47:53.595
Oh, oh...

47:55.538 --> 47:57.137
OK... (sniffs)

47:59.002 --> 48:01.136
(panting)

48:01.138 --> 48:02.637
What's the nearest town?

48:03.843 --> 48:05.646
W-Wannaska.

48:05.648 --> 48:07.411
Ab-about two hours.

48:09.247 --> 48:10.978
You say you ain't a bad person?

48:10.980 --> 48:12.855
No.

48:12.857 --> 48:14.882
Then you're gonna prove it to
me.

48:14.884 --> 48:17.618
You're gonna drive like hell
till we hit Wannaska.

48:17.620 --> 48:20.128
And go straight to the police
station.

48:20.130 --> 48:22.296
You tell 'em to send
the whole dang force.

48:22.298 --> 48:25.261
Then, and only then, do you find
your way to the doctor.

48:25.263 --> 48:27.464
You got that?
- I will.

48:27.466 --> 48:30.101
Don't make me regret this.
- I won't.

48:30.103 --> 48:32.905
Yeah, OK.
- I swear.

48:32.907 --> 48:34.640
All right,
well, get goin'.

48:34.642 --> 48:35.538
Thank you.

48:36.447 --> 48:38.944
(He groans)

48:38.946 --> 48:41.113
(Door slams)
OK...

48:41.115 --> 48:43.981
(She pants)
- (He groans)

48:43.983 --> 48:45.955
(He mumbles indistinctly)

48:48.789 --> 48:50.993
(He mumbles)

48:52.055 --> 48:53.358
Here.

48:56.829 --> 48:58.066
OK...

49:01.405 --> 49:02.900
Thank you.

49:02.902 --> 49:05.469
(He groans)

49:12.410 --> 49:14.247
(Door closes)
- (She sighs)

49:14.914 --> 49:16.711
(Engine starts)

49:22.725 --> 49:24.653
(ominous music playing)

49:51.017 --> 49:52.615
(Man groans loudly)

49:54.117 --> 49:56.025
(grunting)

50:01.631 --> 50:03.829
(wind whistling)

50:03.831 --> 50:05.727
(car rattling)

50:09.838 --> 50:12.041
(He groans loudly)

50:13.907 --> 50:15.770
(Brakes squeak)

50:19.242 --> 50:21.815
(He shivers)

50:21.817 --> 50:23.679
(engines running)

50:29.219 --> 50:31.126
(Engine stops)

50:33.927 --> 50:35.790
(engine running)

50:39.796 --> 50:43.067
(Handbrake creaks)
- (Girl whimpers)

50:43.069 --> 50:44.799
(man groaning softly)

50:47.270 --> 50:49.209
No, no, no, no.

50:49.211 --> 50:51.906
No, no!
- What the fuck are you doing?

50:51.908 --> 50:54.679
Fuck! - Why aren't you on the
lake setting up?

50:54.681 --> 50:57.983
(man) It's all set up, but...
- (woman) But what?

50:57.985 --> 51:00.689
(man) I... Look at me.

51:00.691 --> 51:03.023
(groaning) I need help.

51:03.025 --> 51:05.322
(woman) Then you come to me.

51:05.324 --> 51:07.426
I'm your wife. You come to me!

51:08.626 --> 51:11.333
Like I went to you. That's what
we do.

51:11.335 --> 51:14.428
You made a fucking vow
and you're gonna run out on me?

51:14.430 --> 51:16.832
Now when I need you most?

51:16.834 --> 51:20.739
No... - When you know what
happens if this...

51:20.741 --> 51:25.081
You know exactly what
happens. We have to make this
work.

51:26.782 --> 51:28.612
(panting softly)

51:34.450 --> 51:36.257
It ain't gonna work.

51:42.227 --> 51:44.529
This whole thing, it's...

51:45.801 --> 51:47.862
fucking batshit.

51:52.140 --> 51:54.143
What other choice do I have?

51:59.216 --> 52:02.944
I'm not giving up.
Not when there's a chance.

52:02.946 --> 52:05.451
We just need to make it to
Littlefork. - OK.

52:06.855 --> 52:08.223
OK.
- Yeah.

52:09.892 --> 52:11.787
Say we make it...

52:13.456 --> 52:15.759
(He groans softly)

52:15.761 --> 52:20.400
Are you even sure
you can trust this surgeon?

52:22.139 --> 52:25.735
Are you even sure he's gonna be
there?

52:30.243 --> 52:31.906
Let's just
leave this shit.

52:33.784 --> 52:34.909
It ain't too late.

52:36.787 --> 52:38.319
We can walk away.

52:39.217 --> 52:40.915
(She pants)

52:46.522 --> 52:48.626
(She coughs, groans)

52:54.399 --> 52:55.930
We walk away
and then what?

52:58.408 --> 53:01.375
Just wait for me to die
and you're rid of me?

53:03.076 --> 53:07.475
Is that what you want? - No,
it... it ain't like that,
babe...

53:07.477 --> 53:08.349
The fuck it ain't!

53:22.294 --> 53:24.233
(She sighs softly)

53:29.036 --> 53:30.965
(She sniffs)

53:39.278 --> 53:40.975
(She groans softly)

53:44.182 --> 53:45.980
(groaning)

53:50.222 --> 53:52.723
(She grunts)

53:56.459 --> 53:57.992
(She groans)

54:07.372 --> 54:09.938
(soft music playing)

54:25.356 --> 54:27.263
(She grunts)

54:29.999 --> 54:31.894
(She groans loudly)

54:34.133 --> 54:35.029
Karl!

54:36.300 --> 54:38.740
(panting)

54:38.742 --> 54:39.638
Karl!

54:42.211 --> 54:44.907
(She groans)
- Hon? Hon?

54:46.846 --> 54:49.043
We need to go to the hospital.
- Whoa, whoa.

54:50.051 --> 54:50.946
In, in, in.

54:58.629 --> 54:59.922
OK.

55:02.394 --> 55:04.399
(She grunts loudly)

55:06.662 --> 55:08.667
(ominous music playing)

55:27.650 --> 55:29.490
(Music intensifies)

55:43.699 --> 55:45.803
(soft music playing)

55:56.053 --> 55:57.485
(Karl)<i> We'll keep trying.</i>

56:00.616 --> 56:01.687
We won't quit.

56:06.964 --> 56:08.826
(ominous music playing)

56:21.506 --> 56:24.105
(She groans, pants)

56:36.288 --> 56:38.152
(panting)

56:45.496 --> 56:47.494
(She sniffs)

56:47.496 --> 56:48.965
Come on.

56:50.799 --> 56:52.771
Come on, you stinker!

56:54.307 --> 56:56.170
(panting softly)

56:59.315 --> 57:02.743
Oh, jeez, ya stupid, frickin'...

57:02.745 --> 57:04.948
(She grunts, groans)

57:08.386 --> 57:09.722
Oh... Oh!

57:13.756 --> 57:15.893
(explosion echoes)

57:20.663 --> 57:22.763
(wind whistling)

57:22.765 --> 57:24.836
(engine rumbling)

57:31.309 --> 57:32.206
Hey!

57:33.642 --> 57:36.215
(panting)

57:36.217 --> 57:38.014
Oh! Hey, hey!

57:38.647 --> 57:41.055
Ah, ah...

57:41.057 --> 57:43.684
Hey! Hey! Hey!

57:43.686 --> 57:45.293
Hey, hey...

57:45.295 --> 57:48.195
(Brakes screech)
- Oh, oh...

57:48.197 --> 57:50.290
(She pants loudly)

57:50.292 --> 57:53.768
Hey, I'm the CB lady.
I called you on the CB...

57:53.770 --> 57:57.532
Keep your hands up where
we can see 'em! Both of 'em, up!

57:57.534 --> 58:01.070
Sorry, sorry. It's just it's
kinda... It's kinda difficult.

58:02.308 --> 58:03.604
Stop!

58:03.606 --> 58:07.208
(panting) It's kinda... It's
kinda difficult at the moment.

58:14.553 --> 58:16.421
OK, you can put 'em down.

58:16.423 --> 58:18.819
(She continues panting)

58:18.821 --> 58:23.897
Oh, am I glad to see you boys! -
What the hell happened over
there?

58:23.899 --> 58:27.294
Had to blow my truck up,
so you could find me. (panting)

58:27.296 --> 58:29.830
It's a damn needle in a haystack
out here.

58:29.832 --> 58:31.566
That was you on the CB?

58:31.568 --> 58:34.802
Yeah, one of them kidnappers
attacked me and busted it up.

58:34.804 --> 58:36.508
Where is this fella now?

58:36.510 --> 58:40.743
I had to let him go 'cause he
got pretty sick after falling in
the lake.

58:40.745 --> 58:45.081
He needed a doctor, but he's not
the... It's his wife we gotta
worry about.

58:45.083 --> 58:48.084
She's got the girl.
And she was in the cellar.

58:48.086 --> 58:51.493
Then she was in the truck and
now...

58:51.495 --> 58:54.691
Now I... I'm not sure where she
is.

58:54.693 --> 58:58.630
We should probably really get
headin' back over to the cabin
right now.

58:58.632 --> 59:00.398
Are you armed?
- Huh?

59:00.400 --> 59:01.295
Are you armed?

59:02.171 --> 59:04.898
Oh, uh, here...

59:04.900 --> 59:06.905
Whoa, whoa, whoa! Whoa!

59:08.044 --> 59:09.837
Sorry.

59:09.839 --> 59:13.841
Sorry. It's only got the five
shots, though. She's got a
rifle.

59:13.843 --> 59:17.110
She don't hesitate to use it
neither. She got me in the arm
here.

59:17.112 --> 59:19.384
(She pants, sniffs)
- Yeah.

59:19.386 --> 59:23.884
I'm thinking we should probably
hang on to that for you, just to
be safe.

59:23.886 --> 59:28.655
Oh, jeez... I'd really prefer to
keep her on me if you don't
mind.

59:28.657 --> 59:32.062
Listen, lady, we'll take a look
at whatever the trouble is,

59:32.064 --> 59:35.329
but, you know, we don't know you
from Adam, so...

59:37.236 --> 59:39.841
We'll keep her safe and sound
in the glove box.

59:39.843 --> 59:43.744
Don't worry. You... We, uh... We
can handle this for you.

59:46.650 --> 59:49.349
Oh... - It's that or we can
leave you here.

59:49.351 --> 59:50.718
What's it gonna be?

59:51.814 --> 59:53.347
(She sighs)

59:56.424 --> 59:58.154
Get it.
- OK.

01:00:05.928 --> 01:00:07.801
(tense music playing)

01:00:38.366 --> 01:00:40.295
(Brakes squeak)

01:00:47.705 --> 01:00:49.403
(engine running)

01:00:53.481 --> 01:00:55.442
(man 1) Just the one lady?

01:00:55.444 --> 01:00:58.579
(Barb) Yeah,
her husband's long gone by now.

01:00:58.581 --> 01:01:02.484
(man 2) What's she doing in
there? - Heck if I know.

01:01:02.486 --> 01:01:05.051
Maybe we should just head to
town, get the cops.

01:01:05.053 --> 01:01:06.387
No, it'll take hours.

01:01:13.336 --> 01:01:15.165
(engine rumbling)

01:01:17.836 --> 01:01:21.871
Let's just go talk to her,
figure out what the hell's going
on round here.

01:01:21.873 --> 01:01:26.240
I'm not sure that's such a smart
idea. She's dangerous as all
heck. Maybe...

01:01:26.242 --> 01:01:30.147
We'll have a friendly little
conversation, see what she has
to say for herself.

01:01:31.647 --> 01:01:35.048
(man 2) We got this. - We
need to be careful about this.

01:01:35.050 --> 01:01:36.950
Consider all the angles.

01:01:36.952 --> 01:01:38.419
You stay here.

01:01:39.562 --> 01:01:41.455
(She sighs)
- (Door closes)

01:01:43.695 --> 01:01:45.195
Oh, wow, heck.

01:01:46.895 --> 01:01:48.432
All right.

01:01:48.434 --> 01:01:49.364
Oh, boy.

01:01:50.604 --> 01:01:52.466
(ominous music playing)

01:02:04.617 --> 01:02:06.480
(She grunts)

01:02:07.554 --> 01:02:09.483
(She sighs)

01:02:21.964 --> 01:02:23.601
Howdy there!

01:02:23.603 --> 01:02:25.499
(engine running)

01:02:31.210 --> 01:02:33.243
We just want to ask you a few
questions.

01:02:53.832 --> 01:02:55.199
You all right in there?

01:03:02.577 --> 01:03:05.275
(ominous music continues)

01:03:19.890 --> 01:03:20.796
What the fuck?

01:03:22.729 --> 01:03:24.195
(gunshot)
Oh!

01:03:26.535 --> 01:03:28.430
Oh, please don't...

01:03:31.440 --> 01:03:33.573
(Man groans)

01:03:33.575 --> 01:03:35.305
Oh, shit! Oh, oh!

01:03:39.041 --> 01:03:41.779
Ah, ah, ah, ah!

01:03:41.781 --> 01:03:44.582
Oh, God!
(gunshot)

01:03:44.584 --> 01:03:45.381
Shit!

01:03:47.215 --> 01:03:48.989
(gunshot)
Oh!

01:03:51.023 --> 01:03:53.059
(gunshot)
Uh, uh...

01:03:54.431 --> 01:03:56.590
(She screams, pants)

01:04:00.737 --> 01:04:03.099
(Woman screams)
- (Gun clicks)

01:04:03.101 --> 01:04:05.401
(Woman screams)
- (Barb groans)

01:04:08.137 --> 01:04:10.010
(woman groaning in pain)

01:04:13.878 --> 01:04:16.082
(Woman screams)

01:04:17.486 --> 01:04:19.415
(woman groaning)

01:04:23.557 --> 01:04:25.856
(gunshots)

01:04:25.858 --> 01:04:27.863
(Barb screams, groans)

01:04:35.063 --> 01:04:37.598
(panting)

01:04:50.552 --> 01:04:52.749
(Barb groans)

01:04:52.751 --> 01:04:54.582
(gunshot)

01:04:57.219 --> 01:04:59.455
(She pants loudly)

01:05:06.028 --> 01:05:07.166
Aagh!

01:05:11.002 --> 01:05:13.040
(Barb) You awake in there?

01:05:15.072 --> 01:05:17.043
(man) Who's that?

01:05:17.045 --> 01:05:20.641
Oh, jeez, Karl, you know who it
is.

01:05:22.617 --> 01:05:23.677
It's your wife.

01:05:25.114 --> 01:05:26.218
You old coot.

01:05:28.054 --> 01:05:30.486
Huh? Let's get you out of there.

01:05:31.395 --> 01:05:32.527
Up you get.

01:05:32.529 --> 01:05:34.457
There you go. That's it.

01:05:35.664 --> 01:05:38.591
OK. Sorry, it's cold.

01:05:38.593 --> 01:05:40.661
(Karl groans softly)
- Uh-huh.

01:05:41.768 --> 01:05:42.696
Other foot.

01:05:49.143 --> 01:05:51.342
Let's get this water nice and
hot.

01:05:56.784 --> 01:05:58.679
(soft music playing)

01:06:02.352 --> 01:06:05.059
You want 'em fried or poached?

01:06:07.497 --> 01:06:08.689
Fried it is.

01:06:11.227 --> 01:06:17.136
You know, I was just thinking
back to that Mille Lacs trip in
'98.

01:06:17.138 --> 01:06:19.073
Wish we'd got a picture of that
pike.

01:06:21.204 --> 01:06:22.406
What a beaut, huh?

01:06:24.072 --> 01:06:25.079
Still...

01:06:26.378 --> 01:06:28.280
we'll always know you caught
her.

01:06:32.085 --> 01:06:34.522
That's the most important thing.

01:06:34.524 --> 01:06:36.453
(oil sizzling)

01:06:40.388 --> 01:06:42.459
(She chuckles softly)

01:06:46.029 --> 01:06:46.760
Karl?

01:06:52.467 --> 01:06:54.438
(melancholic
music playing)

01:06:55.907 --> 01:06:56.770
Karl?

01:07:53.266 --> 01:07:57.098
(coughs) Oh!
- (girl) Hey, hey!

01:07:57.100 --> 01:07:59.399
(groaning)

01:07:59.401 --> 01:08:00.834
(girl) Are you OK?

01:08:04.581 --> 01:08:06.477
(Barb groans)

01:08:08.277 --> 01:08:09.447
Oh, well...

01:08:10.282 --> 01:08:12.846
(panting) ...I'll be darned.

01:08:16.451 --> 01:08:17.851
She didn't kill me.

01:08:19.187 --> 01:08:20.524
Oh!

01:08:22.930 --> 01:08:24.198
Is that your blood?

01:08:27.495 --> 01:08:29.164
(whimpering) It's his.

01:08:29.166 --> 01:08:31.497
Oh... Yeah.

01:08:31.499 --> 01:08:33.466
What's gonna happen to us?

01:08:33.468 --> 01:08:35.301
I really don't know.

01:08:35.303 --> 01:08:37.672
(panting)

01:08:37.674 --> 01:08:40.275
Have you ever seen these people
before?

01:08:40.277 --> 01:08:42.581
The woman, maybe.

01:08:42.583 --> 01:08:45.311
I... I think I saw her at the
hospital back when...

01:08:45.313 --> 01:08:47.814
(She sobs)

01:08:47.816 --> 01:08:49.883
(Girl struggles to speak) But I
tried...

01:08:51.722 --> 01:08:54.327
Oh, hon. Honey, hon...
- (Girl sobs)

01:08:55.599 --> 01:08:57.490
Honey! Oh...

01:08:57.492 --> 01:09:00.031
(Girl continues sobbing)

01:09:00.033 --> 01:09:02.336
I don't wanna die!

01:09:02.338 --> 01:09:05.798
That... that's good. That's a
good thing.

01:09:05.800 --> 01:09:08.440
(sobbing)
- Hey, what's your name?

01:09:13.814 --> 01:09:15.545
Leah.

01:09:15.547 --> 01:09:20.718
Leah? Oh, my husband loved that
name.

01:09:20.720 --> 01:09:23.616
It was right at the top of our
list. No foolin'.

01:09:23.618 --> 01:09:28.693
For a boy, we were thinking
Eric, and for a girl, it was
gonna be Leah.

01:09:28.695 --> 01:09:31.925
Between you and me,
I was sorta hopin' for a girl.

01:09:37.136 --> 01:09:38.940
What are we gonna do?

01:09:38.942 --> 01:09:40.868
(Distant door bangs, creaks)

01:09:43.207 --> 01:09:44.740
I don't know.

01:09:51.185 --> 01:09:54.321
(Leah whimpers)
- Oh, hon.

01:09:58.153 --> 01:10:01.460
Say, did you ever hear about the
Great Blizzard of 1888?

01:10:02.891 --> 01:10:06.300
Well, it froze half the darn
country.

01:10:06.302 --> 01:10:09.003
It was one of the worst
in recorded history

01:10:09.005 --> 01:10:11.670
and my great-grandfather Iver,

01:10:11.672 --> 01:10:14.901
he found himself stuck smack in
the middle of the thing.

01:10:14.903 --> 01:10:18.037
There was nothing but him, his
ox

01:10:18.039 --> 01:10:20.642
and a big sack of grain he was
carrying.

01:10:20.644 --> 01:10:24.885
Think he was coming back from
the mill or something, out in
Lac qui Parle County.

01:10:24.887 --> 01:10:26.479
Montevideo, actually.

01:10:26.481 --> 01:10:31.593
Anyway, he's on his way home in
the middle of this huge
snowstorm.

01:10:31.595 --> 01:10:36.897
Oh, oh, and by the way, hundreds
of people died in this storm.

01:10:36.899 --> 01:10:41.365
OK, this was not just a couple
of dainty snowflakes floating
around,

01:10:41.367 --> 01:10:43.501
if that's what you're thinking.

01:10:43.503 --> 01:10:46.733
So, the snow keeps falling and
falling.

01:10:46.735 --> 01:10:49.169
Iver, he can't see a damn thing.

01:10:49.171 --> 01:10:52.305
And he's tired, he's hungry,
but he can't stop, see?

01:10:52.307 --> 01:10:55.377
'Cause if he stops moving,
he's gonna freeze to death.

01:10:55.379 --> 01:10:56.845
So, what does he do?

01:11:00.086 --> 01:11:01.553
He keeps goin'.

01:11:03.057 --> 01:11:06.493
Simple as that. He walks.

01:11:06.495 --> 01:11:11.631
With that ox and that
grain through the damn blizzard,

01:11:11.633 --> 01:11:14.932
mile after mile after mile,
just him and that ox,

01:11:14.934 --> 01:11:18.405
puttin' one foot in front of the
other till, before you know it,

01:11:18.407 --> 01:11:21.436
the sun is peeking out through
the clouds

01:11:21.438 --> 01:11:23.476
and the storm's over.

01:11:32.018 --> 01:11:33.285
That's it?

01:11:33.287 --> 01:11:36.049
That's it... What, that's...

01:11:37.126 --> 01:11:40.320
Think about what Iver did there!

01:11:40.322 --> 01:11:43.760
What... If he'd given up, I
wouldn't... I wouldn't be here.

01:11:43.762 --> 01:11:47.229
I wouldn't even have been born.
- (Girl sniffs)

01:11:47.231 --> 01:11:50.899
I never would've... I never
would've met my husband Karl.

01:11:50.901 --> 01:11:53.033
We never would've had the joy
of...

01:11:54.536 --> 01:11:56.671
spending our...

01:11:56.673 --> 01:11:58.071
(sobbing) ...lives together.

01:12:02.646 --> 01:12:04.451
Heck, all's I'm sayin' is...

01:12:05.618 --> 01:12:08.081
(sniffs) ...we don't know what's
comin'.

01:12:09.622 --> 01:12:13.020
We never really do, but it don't
matter.

01:12:14.457 --> 01:12:16.023
We don't quit.

01:12:21.970 --> 01:12:23.866
(Girl sniffs)

01:12:25.172 --> 01:12:27.067
(Door slams upstairs)

01:12:28.670 --> 01:12:30.543
I... I think she left.

01:12:32.407 --> 01:12:33.480
OK.

01:12:35.016 --> 01:12:36.912
(Barb groans)

01:12:42.584 --> 01:12:44.623
(She sighs)

01:12:45.356 --> 01:12:47.087
Oh, where...

01:12:48.063 --> 01:12:50.229
Oh, it's up there.

01:12:50.231 --> 01:12:51.662
What?
- It's up there.

01:12:51.664 --> 01:12:54.528
I saw her search you.
- Oh, oh.

01:12:54.530 --> 01:12:56.833
(panting) OK.

01:13:02.506 --> 01:13:04.577
(Barb groans, grunts)

01:13:06.279 --> 01:13:08.141
(tense music playing)

01:13:09.919 --> 01:13:12.079
(She grunts)

01:13:12.580 --> 01:13:14.752
(panting)

01:13:19.754 --> 01:13:21.957
(She pants heavily)

01:13:23.195 --> 01:13:25.092
Oh! Shit.

01:13:26.134 --> 01:13:28.598
Sorry. Oh, shoot!

01:13:28.600 --> 01:13:30.263
Give me your shoes.
- What?

01:13:30.265 --> 01:13:32.934
Come on, quick.
She could be back any second.

01:13:32.936 --> 01:13:35.438
What's so important about that
box?

01:13:35.440 --> 01:13:36.972
That's it, good. OK.

01:13:38.309 --> 01:13:40.173
(panting)

01:13:43.148 --> 01:13:44.045
Ah!

01:13:45.483 --> 01:13:47.114
Yeah, okey-dokey.

01:13:48.650 --> 01:13:50.656
(She yells)

01:13:51.653 --> 01:13:54.158
Oh, oh, ugh!

01:13:54.160 --> 01:13:56.024
(panting)

01:14:14.676 --> 01:14:17.210
(She grunts)

01:14:19.549 --> 01:14:21.852
(She grunts)

01:14:23.092 --> 01:14:24.118
I think I'm gonna...

01:14:28.226 --> 01:14:29.222
Oh, boy.

01:14:37.402 --> 01:14:39.600
(She grunts)

01:14:39.602 --> 01:14:40.937
Getting there.

01:14:43.507 --> 01:14:45.238
(Metal squeaks)

01:14:49.978 --> 01:14:52.047
(muttering to herself) Come on.

01:14:58.522 --> 01:15:00.495
Here. Souvenir.

01:15:04.726 --> 01:15:06.633
(Barb groans)

01:15:08.103 --> 01:15:10.230
(She grunts)

01:15:15.275 --> 01:15:17.171
(She yells)

01:15:21.017 --> 01:15:22.913
(She yells)

01:15:23.711 --> 01:15:25.718
(panting)

01:15:31.060 --> 01:15:32.989
(dramatic music)

01:15:43.766 --> 01:15:45.672
(She groans loudly)

01:15:54.147 --> 01:15:55.781
Agh! Oh!

01:15:56.812 --> 01:15:58.952
Jesus!
- Oh...

01:15:58.954 --> 01:16:00.313
Oh, OK.

01:16:01.485 --> 01:16:03.316
(panting)

01:16:07.327 --> 01:16:08.321
There you go.

01:16:09.627 --> 01:16:11.060
Get these back on.

01:16:12.366 --> 01:16:14.602
(grunting, panting)

01:16:16.931 --> 01:16:19.238
(She groans loudly)

01:16:19.240 --> 01:16:21.000
Here you go.

01:16:21.002 --> 01:16:25.971
(chuckles) When was the last
time someone helped you on with
your boots?

01:16:25.973 --> 01:16:28.378
(She chuckles softly)

01:16:28.380 --> 01:16:30.046
(panting)

01:16:30.646 --> 01:16:31.949
Oh...

01:16:33.186 --> 01:16:34.083
OK.

01:16:43.562 --> 01:16:45.325
(She grunts, pants)

01:16:46.366 --> 01:16:48.562
Oh! Oh, God.

01:16:48.564 --> 01:16:49.863
I...

01:16:49.865 --> 01:16:52.365
It's no good. Uh...

01:16:55.509 --> 01:16:56.843
Storm doors!
- Huh?

01:16:56.845 --> 01:16:59.009
Try the storm doors.
- Oh, yeah, good idea.

01:17:06.353 --> 01:17:08.282
(loud rattling)

01:17:08.850 --> 01:17:11.450
(She sighs)

01:17:11.452 --> 01:17:14.090
They're rusty. I can... I can
jimmy 'em.

01:17:18.693 --> 01:17:19.392
Ah!

01:17:20.467 --> 01:17:21.702
That's gonna do it.

01:17:23.571 --> 01:17:26.399
OK, OK, let's get rid of this.

01:17:29.111 --> 01:17:30.777
OK. Right.

01:17:33.007 --> 01:17:34.946
(She groans, pants)

01:17:37.245 --> 01:17:39.412
Jesus Christ!
(loud rattling)

01:17:40.420 --> 01:17:41.584
That's good.

01:17:41.586 --> 01:17:43.284
OK, next one.

01:17:46.020 --> 01:17:48.058
(She grunts loudly)

01:17:49.791 --> 01:17:51.699
(rattling)

01:17:53.828 --> 01:17:55.736
(rattling)

01:17:57.899 --> 01:17:59.905
(She groans)

01:18:03.977 --> 01:18:06.681
You really are one clever bitch,
ain't ya?

01:18:14.752 --> 01:18:16.449
(ominous music playing)

01:18:24.459 --> 01:18:30.803
(man) So, Karl had
an unusual request, um...

01:18:30.805 --> 01:18:34.973
He wanted his ashes to be, uh,
conveyed

01:18:34.975 --> 01:18:37.976
via this particular container,
uh...

01:18:38.974 --> 01:18:41.678
up to a particular lake

01:18:41.680 --> 01:18:43.580
up north and, uh...

01:18:43.582 --> 01:18:44.785
scattered there.

01:18:47.949 --> 01:18:49.317
Which lake?

01:18:52.722 --> 01:18:53.761
Um...

01:18:56.927 --> 01:18:58.359
Lake Hilda.
- Oh.

01:18:59.627 --> 01:19:02.495
(She chuckles) - He's got a map
here for you too.

01:19:03.937 --> 01:19:06.131
I guess it's not too easy to
find.

01:19:06.133 --> 01:19:08.039
Pretty far out there, huh?

01:19:10.576 --> 01:19:12.710
(She chuckles)

01:19:12.712 --> 01:19:14.474
Do you mind if
I ask, uh...

01:19:16.048 --> 01:19:17.983
What's so special about Lake
Hilda?

01:19:25.955 --> 01:19:27.894
(ominous music playing)

01:19:56.358 --> 01:19:58.254
(She sighs)

01:20:05.159 --> 01:20:07.164
(breathing heavily)

01:21:16.604 --> 01:21:18.103
(woman) Unload it.

01:21:31.013 --> 01:21:32.920
(Barb sniffs)

01:21:38.226 --> 01:21:41.720
We need to redress that.
You're losing too much blood.

01:21:41.722 --> 01:21:44.289
I don't need your fucking
advice, lady.

01:21:44.291 --> 01:21:45.758
I know what I'm doing.

01:21:45.760 --> 01:21:48.298
You'll lose the whole leg
if it gets infected.

01:21:48.300 --> 01:21:51.135
The least of my worries.
- Because you're dying.

01:21:51.137 --> 01:21:53.899
That's why you take those,
right?

01:21:53.901 --> 01:21:56.902
I'm sorry for what you're going
through. Really, I am.

01:21:56.904 --> 01:22:00.773
But whatever this is,
it ain't gonna change anything.

01:22:00.775 --> 01:22:04.985
You're wrong. I just need to get
to Littlefork.

01:22:07.682 --> 01:22:09.682
Open that box and put it over
there.

01:22:34.814 --> 01:22:36.544
(tense music playing)

01:22:45.019 --> 01:22:48.854
Put her on the table. -
Please, you don't have to do
this.

01:22:48.856 --> 01:22:51.361
Put her on the table.
- She's just a child.

01:22:51.363 --> 01:22:53.358
I'll take her place.
- You're too old.

01:22:53.360 --> 01:22:57.168
She's living on borrowed time
anyway. - That doesn't make it
right.

01:22:57.170 --> 01:22:58.997
I'll get you help. I'll find
money.

01:22:58.999 --> 01:23:02.268
I'll do anything, but
don't do this. She's just a
child.

01:23:02.270 --> 01:23:05.738
She's got her whole life ahead
of her. - Put her on the fucking
table!
