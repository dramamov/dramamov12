WEBVTT

00:00:08.074 --> 00:00:09.642
I have to go home.

00:00:12.679 --> 00:00:16.316
We're terribly sorry that one of
our students caused trouble.

00:00:16.416 --> 00:00:18.551
Please. Let me go home.

00:00:18.651 --> 00:00:20.220
She's been like this the whole time.

00:00:20.286 --> 00:00:21.521
Not even an apology.

00:00:21.988 --> 00:00:23.857
Is it around the time
your helper has to leave?

00:00:27.227 --> 00:00:28.395
Can you head over there?

00:00:29.062 --> 00:00:30.130
Yes.

00:00:34.768 --> 00:00:36.536
Ms. Koreeda will go for you, so...

00:00:42.075 --> 00:00:45.445
Can you leave us alone
for five minutes?

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:48.314
Please.

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:08.435
Have a seat.

00:01:29.389 --> 00:01:31.491
I knew you had left early

00:01:33.293 --> 00:01:35.228
but I was too overwhelmed
with my own stuff.

00:01:38.064 --> 00:01:39.132
I'm sorry.

00:01:45.004 --> 00:01:47.607
I understand what it's like
to carry everything alone.

00:01:53.713 --> 00:01:55.014
I was the same.

00:01:57.917 --> 00:02:02.522
I don't know much about periods,
so I need to be taught.

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:21.307
From the start...

00:02:26.446 --> 00:02:28.248
it was never light for me.

00:02:30.917 --> 00:02:31.918
Then...

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:41.995
when my grandfather's
dementia worsened

00:02:45.598 --> 00:02:48.201
my PMS got much worse.

00:02:49.502 --> 00:02:51.638
PMS...

00:02:51.704 --> 00:02:54.007
You mean pre-menstrual syndrome?

00:02:54.841 --> 00:02:56.009
In my case...

00:02:57.677 --> 00:03:01.181
I get irritable.

00:03:01.614 --> 00:03:03.349
I cry for no reason.

00:03:04.751 --> 00:03:06.052
I can't control it.

00:03:07.887 --> 00:03:10.056
The thought of my period coming

00:03:12.859 --> 00:03:14.127
makes me anxious too.

00:03:20.233 --> 00:03:23.836
We won't be
reporting this to the police.

00:03:24.671 --> 00:03:25.972
Thank you very much.

00:03:28.708 --> 00:03:29.876
I...

00:03:32.745 --> 00:03:34.180
I'm really sorry.

00:03:35.982 --> 00:03:38.218
Please just pay for the items.

00:03:38.518 --> 00:03:39.586
Of course.

00:03:41.688 --> 00:03:42.855
Wait a moment.

00:03:43.456 --> 00:03:44.457
What?

00:03:47.227 --> 00:03:48.261
What?

00:03:54.200 --> 00:03:55.835
All of these, please.

00:03:56.836 --> 00:03:58.504
Sure, but...

00:03:58.972 --> 00:03:59.973
What?

00:04:00.073 --> 00:04:01.841
Would this be enough
until you graduate?

00:04:09.816 --> 00:04:11.417
Do you need a plastic bag?
It's extra.

00:04:11.517 --> 00:04:12.518
Yes, please.

00:04:15.588 --> 00:04:17.190
This is my first time buying these.

00:04:30.570 --> 00:04:33.840
MR. MIKAMI'S CLASSROOM

00:04:34.574 --> 00:04:37.143
You're working
several part-time jobs, aren't you?

00:04:39.212 --> 00:04:42.482
We still have a bit of money saved.

00:04:44.350 --> 00:04:46.719
But it's only decreasing,
and that makes me anxious.

00:04:48.888 --> 00:04:52.725
Working part-time does help to
take your mind off things, too.

00:04:53.159 --> 00:04:55.295
Was it like that for you, too?

00:04:55.561 --> 00:04:58.364
I crammed my schedule with
studying and part-time jobs.

00:04:59.532 --> 00:05:03.803
In my case, I'm living
with my grandparents.

00:05:04.971 --> 00:05:09.776
So I had prepared myself
for caregiving to some degree.

00:05:12.879 --> 00:05:14.480
But when it's your mom

00:05:16.683 --> 00:05:18.551
it's a different kind of
weight, right?

00:05:26.492 --> 00:05:28.861
Excuse me. What about your mom's?

00:05:29.429 --> 00:05:30.430
What?

00:05:30.530 --> 00:05:32.699
Well, you said
you had never bought these.

00:05:33.599 --> 00:05:34.634
Right...

00:05:38.871 --> 00:05:41.274
I always had someone else
buy that stuff for her.

00:05:45.144 --> 00:05:46.446
That's pretty pathetic, right?

00:05:49.349 --> 00:05:50.383
Well...

00:05:51.551 --> 00:05:54.554
You did a total 180.

00:05:56.356 --> 00:05:58.925
I actually talked to everyone
about it today.

00:06:00.493 --> 00:06:01.494
What?

00:06:01.627 --> 00:06:03.730
Regarding what was written about
my brother in the magazine article.

00:06:07.166 --> 00:06:08.568
I want to hear about that too.

00:06:10.203 --> 00:06:12.739
Yeah, I guess you would.

00:06:20.880 --> 00:06:22.148
I'm so sorry.

00:06:24.350 --> 00:06:27.153
You really did your best, Shiiba.

00:06:29.655 --> 00:06:30.656
Excuse me...

00:06:35.261 --> 00:06:38.931
Am I going to be expelled?

00:06:41.667 --> 00:06:43.336
I'll do everything I can.

00:06:47.407 --> 00:06:49.008
Regardless of the circumstances

00:06:49.075 --> 00:06:51.077
it's unacceptable
for a Rintoku student

00:06:51.144 --> 00:06:52.578
to be committing shoplifting.

00:06:53.045 --> 00:06:54.847
This has never happened before.

00:06:55.148 --> 00:06:58.017
We cannot just let it go
without any consequences.

00:06:58.951 --> 00:07:00.853
– What?
– What?

00:07:00.953 --> 00:07:03.990
– What? Not again!
– What's going on now?

00:07:04.257 --> 00:07:05.925
Well, the thing is...

00:07:06.759 --> 00:07:08.261
Have you solved the mystery?
We are ready to talk.

00:07:08.361 --> 00:07:09.362
Prince Yamato Takeru

00:07:09.462 --> 00:07:11.898
Well, you sure look like
you had a nice time.

00:07:12.598 --> 00:07:13.699
Not at all.

00:07:13.800 --> 00:07:16.969
A mere high school teacher
meeting a government official

00:07:17.069 --> 00:07:18.504
at a fancy restaurant?

00:07:20.706 --> 00:07:24.110
Didn't you think it was
beyond your station?

00:07:25.044 --> 00:07:27.747
I thought it'd be better to
talk to them in person.

00:07:30.116 --> 00:07:33.386
You like being in the spotlight,
don't you, Mr. Mizobata?

00:07:34.020 --> 00:07:35.488
It's "Mizohata."

00:07:35.755 --> 00:07:40.860
Right. What a troublesome person
you are, Mr. Mizohata.

00:07:44.096 --> 00:07:47.400
So, what's going on
with that shoplifting incident?

00:07:48.134 --> 00:07:50.002
Well...

00:07:50.470 --> 00:07:53.039
She has stained Rintoku's reputation.

00:07:53.940 --> 00:07:55.975
That should at least
warrant expulsion.

00:07:56.709 --> 00:07:57.977
Expulsion? For shoplifting?

00:07:58.077 --> 00:08:03.416
I think what she did
warrants as much.

00:08:09.755 --> 00:08:12.191
You two heard about Yuzuru's incident

00:08:12.258 --> 00:08:14.327
directly from Ms. Saejima, right?

00:08:16.128 --> 00:08:17.697
It was right after it happened.

00:08:18.931 --> 00:08:20.867
She said the media
would find out soon enough

00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:23.402
and that the students
might get shaken up.

00:08:23.870 --> 00:08:26.372
So she asked us to help
with emotional support.

00:08:29.942 --> 00:08:32.044
What's with her anyway?

00:08:35.014 --> 00:08:37.383
Doesn't she put herself last
a little too much?

00:08:39.085 --> 00:08:42.522
She was really worried
about you, too, Kanzaki.

00:08:44.056 --> 00:08:48.728
I don't deserve that kind of concern.

00:08:50.463 --> 00:08:51.964
That's just how she is.

00:09:00.239 --> 00:09:01.374
Could it be...

00:09:04.544 --> 00:09:07.380
she's protecting someone, like me?

00:09:09.148 --> 00:09:10.616
Wait, what do you mean?

00:09:11.684 --> 00:09:14.220
I asked her many times, but she
kept saying it was just an affair.

00:09:14.954 --> 00:09:15.955
Shiiba's absent?

00:09:16.322 --> 00:09:18.090
Yeah, it looks like it.

00:09:20.059 --> 00:09:21.794
What's wrong?
You look like you're about to cry.

00:09:22.628 --> 00:09:24.664
I'm just a little worried.

00:09:26.799 --> 00:09:27.833
What? No way!

00:09:29.235 --> 00:09:30.636
My relative works at a drugstore.

00:09:30.736 --> 00:09:31.737
The yearbook?

00:09:31.837 --> 00:09:34.907
Yeah. I want you to
look into something for me.

00:09:35.074 --> 00:09:37.076
Oh, nice!

00:09:39.712 --> 00:09:43.616
Do you even understand what
"inconveniencing others" means?

00:09:44.083 --> 00:09:46.752
Hey, that's rude! Of course I do.

00:09:47.386 --> 00:09:48.387
Really?

00:09:48.487 --> 00:09:52.792
Still, having you rely on me
kind of makes my heart skip a beat.

00:09:53.326 --> 00:09:55.628
Ask what I want you to
look into first.

00:09:55.828 --> 00:09:57.763
You're trying to find someone.
Am I wrong?

00:09:59.398 --> 00:10:00.533
You're not wrong.

00:10:02.301 --> 00:10:03.569
– Heart-skipping moment!
– Heart-skipping moment!

00:10:03.970 --> 00:10:07.406
Hey, that hurts! What was that for?

00:10:08.608 --> 00:10:11.277
If Ms. Saejima is protecting someone,
it has to be a student.

00:10:11.744 --> 00:10:13.713
There's no other explanation.

00:10:17.516 --> 00:10:18.551
What do you want?

00:10:19.218 --> 00:10:20.886
I need a favor.

00:10:21.387 --> 00:10:23.723
My, how you've grown.

00:10:29.762 --> 00:10:32.498
That's something
a teacher says to a student.

00:10:32.732 --> 00:10:35.601
Come on, a favor from Okami?

00:10:36.002 --> 00:10:37.003
Is that bad?

00:10:37.103 --> 00:10:38.638
Not at all. I'm honored.

00:10:40.673 --> 00:10:43.643
Is this favor about Shiiba?

00:10:44.677 --> 00:10:46.345
This is a problem.

00:10:47.179 --> 00:10:50.549
I'm not sure who did this,
but this isn't newsworthy.

00:10:50.650 --> 00:10:52.451
No one would even bat an eye.

00:10:52.652 --> 00:10:56.322
Even so, it seems to have had
a major effect on Mr. Kodai.

00:10:56.922 --> 00:11:00.159
Exactly. He's gotten
all cautious again.

00:11:01.560 --> 00:11:05.264
Right. Chief Cabinet Secretary Azuma
got in touch.

00:11:06.132 --> 00:11:08.234
That doesn't sound like good news.

00:11:08.601 --> 00:11:11.337
"My granddaughter refuses to
go to any school except Rintoku.

00:11:11.637 --> 00:11:14.473
Make a backdoor entry happen."
That's the message.

00:11:15.708 --> 00:11:16.709
I knew it.

00:11:16.809 --> 00:11:18.978
There's also a message
for you, Mr. Tsukada.

00:11:19.378 --> 00:11:21.814
"If you're aiming to
become Vice Minister

00:11:21.914 --> 00:11:24.016
this is your last chance
given your age."

00:11:24.950 --> 00:11:26.152
What will you do?

00:11:26.252 --> 00:11:27.687
What will I do?

00:11:27.787 --> 00:11:30.923
Well, I guess I have no choice but
to get Mr. Kodai to accept it.

00:11:31.824 --> 00:11:34.460
Could you give him
one more push, Mr. Tsukada?

00:11:35.227 --> 00:11:36.228
What?

00:11:36.662 --> 00:11:39.732
Isn't that your job, Mr. Nakaoka?

00:11:57.983 --> 00:11:58.984
I'm sorry.

00:12:14.266 --> 00:12:15.334
Tsubuki?

00:12:17.369 --> 00:12:18.471
Tsubuki!

00:12:26.579 --> 00:12:29.715
– Mai.
– Mr. Makino, sorry.

00:12:30.082 --> 00:12:31.851
They said it was probably
dizziness from overwork.

00:12:32.051 --> 00:12:35.020
But just to be sure,
they're doing an MRI tomorrow.

00:12:35.821 --> 00:12:37.389
Can I see him?

00:12:43.763 --> 00:12:44.830
Why did you come?

00:12:47.800 --> 00:12:50.002
Of course I came.

00:12:51.737 --> 00:12:54.473
What would I have done
if you couldn't see our baby?

00:12:54.774 --> 00:12:57.309
That's being a bit overdramatic.

00:12:58.043 --> 00:13:00.679
– Thank goodness.
– I'm sorry.

00:13:01.714 --> 00:13:04.150
Mr. Takami, can you hear me?

00:13:05.084 --> 00:13:06.118
Are you all right?

00:13:22.168 --> 00:13:24.270
I should get going.

00:13:25.504 --> 00:13:26.872
Thank you very much.

00:13:30.943 --> 00:13:32.711
Tsubuki.

00:13:32.778 --> 00:13:35.114
Even if you're discharged
after tomorrow's tests

00:13:35.848 --> 00:13:37.216
do not come to work.

00:13:37.550 --> 00:13:39.952
– But...
– This is an official order.

00:13:41.520 --> 00:13:45.224
Recently, Haruno Shiiba
from Class 3-2

00:13:45.524 --> 00:13:47.960
was caught shoplifting
at a drugstore.

00:13:48.527 --> 00:13:51.530
It was due to financial
hardship at home

00:13:52.431 --> 00:13:55.267
but we also found out that she was
working multiple part-time jobs

00:13:55.367 --> 00:13:57.069
which are prohibited by school rules.

00:13:58.537 --> 00:14:04.076
Therefore, after much consideration,
we've decided on expulsion.

00:14:04.376 --> 00:14:06.245
She was informed earlier today.

00:14:06.345 --> 00:14:09.415
Why was this decision made without
consulting the homeroom teacher?

00:14:10.516 --> 00:14:13.152
You are not an official staff member
of this school.

00:14:13.452 --> 00:14:14.653
This is outrageous.

00:14:15.054 --> 00:14:18.490
At a time when she needed help
the most, you chose to expel her?

00:14:18.724 --> 00:14:21.493
Among the part-time jobs
Haruno Shiiba was working

00:14:22.494 --> 00:14:24.263
one was creating
a fake profile on a dating site.

00:14:24.763 --> 00:14:25.764
What?

00:14:26.031 --> 00:14:28.334
If things had gone badly,
she could've been charged with fraud.

00:14:28.634 --> 00:14:33.305
Knowing that, we had no choice
but to make this decision.

00:14:43.449 --> 00:14:45.684
There's a rumor going around
that Shiiba was expelled.

00:14:46.285 --> 00:14:48.053
– Is it true?
– Yeah.

00:14:48.621 --> 00:14:49.788
What's going on?

00:14:49.889 --> 00:14:52.024
The school says
they wouldn't disclose the reason

00:14:52.124 --> 00:14:53.425
since it's a personal matter.

00:14:53.993 --> 00:14:55.527
So you're just
going to leave it like this?

00:14:56.462 --> 00:14:57.563
What do you think?

00:14:58.998 --> 00:15:00.132
It's unacceptable.

00:15:08.974 --> 00:15:10.175
Do you know what this is?

00:15:11.110 --> 00:15:12.478
If we know what the denominator is.

00:15:12.811 --> 00:15:15.881
G7. The top seven advanced
countries in the world.

00:15:15.981 --> 00:15:17.917
Then this is probably GDP,
short for gross domestic product

00:15:18.317 --> 00:15:21.320
and it means
ranking third among the G7.

00:15:27.826 --> 00:15:28.827
Okay, what about this?

00:15:28.928 --> 00:15:31.897
The lowest GDP per capita
among the G7.

00:15:33.065 --> 00:15:34.967
Well, that's not wrong per se.

00:15:37.136 --> 00:15:38.871
Relative poverty rate.

00:15:39.471 --> 00:15:42.775
What?
What is "relative poverty rate"?

00:16:00.926 --> 00:16:03.429
Absolute Poverty

00:16:03.529 --> 00:16:06.165
There are countries in the world
where people don't even have

00:16:06.231 --> 00:16:07.900
food or water for tomorrow.

00:16:09.068 --> 00:16:11.704
That's when
the entire country is poor

00:16:11.804 --> 00:16:13.205
and we call that "absolute poverty."

00:16:24.750 --> 00:16:26.251
Relative Poverty

00:16:26.385 --> 00:16:28.420
There's something called
the "poverty line."

00:16:28.821 --> 00:16:31.924
When a household's income
falls below that line

00:16:32.024 --> 00:16:33.325
it refers to the amount of
take-home income.

00:16:35.294 --> 00:16:38.564
This means Japan has
the highest percentage of households

00:16:39.164 --> 00:16:40.699
under the poverty line among the G7.

00:16:42.601 --> 00:16:45.437
Japan was long referred to
as a "middle-class society."

00:16:45.838 --> 00:16:48.507
But before we realized it,
more and more people have been

00:16:48.607 --> 00:16:50.175
slipping out of the middle class.

00:16:50.242 --> 00:16:51.243
In other words...

00:17:00.519 --> 00:17:01.520
Stratified Society

00:17:01.620 --> 00:17:03.789
This is what Japan has become.

00:17:03.956 --> 00:17:05.824
And a pretty extreme one at that.

00:17:15.467 --> 00:17:16.635
Shiiba!

00:17:32.684 --> 00:17:33.786
I looked into it.

00:17:34.086 --> 00:17:36.321
In Rintoku's case, naturally,
at the time of enrollment

00:17:36.422 --> 00:17:40.459
there are virtually zero households
that are financially struggling.

00:17:41.693 --> 00:17:43.695
This school is filled with
people who can afford

00:17:43.796 --> 00:17:45.964
an extremely high tuition,
even among private schools.

00:17:46.198 --> 00:17:48.534
They're all from the top tier
of this stratified society.

00:17:50.436 --> 00:17:52.538
However,
over the course of three years

00:17:52.638 --> 00:17:54.206
it's natural that some students'
financial situations decline.

00:17:54.706 --> 00:17:55.707
In the past

00:17:57.643 --> 00:17:59.778
there were students who had
no choice but to withdraw.

00:18:03.082 --> 00:18:04.083
Shiiba.

00:18:06.418 --> 00:18:07.419
Yes.

00:18:08.087 --> 00:18:09.221
Is there something you'd like to say?

00:18:14.660 --> 00:18:15.661
There is.

00:18:16.995 --> 00:18:17.996
Go ahead.

00:18:44.957 --> 00:18:46.391
I know this is
an important time for everyone.

00:18:48.660 --> 00:18:54.266
So, I'm sorry for taking up
your time with this.

00:18:56.201 --> 00:18:57.202
But...

00:18:58.904 --> 00:19:03.075
Please let me talk for a bit.

00:19:09.114 --> 00:19:13.952
When I was in kindergarten

00:19:17.890 --> 00:19:23.795
my parents died in a car accident.

00:19:28.867 --> 00:19:30.135
However...

00:19:31.436 --> 00:19:36.875
My grandparents raised me and
made sure I had everything I needed.

00:19:41.947 --> 00:19:44.049
Earlier this year...

00:19:47.186 --> 00:19:51.890
my grandfather developed dementia.

00:19:54.927 --> 00:19:57.162
We had to close our shop

00:19:59.531 --> 00:20:02.501
and I became overwhelmed every day.

00:20:06.939 --> 00:20:10.943
And I ended up causing trouble

00:20:13.612 --> 00:20:15.747
for the school and all of you.

00:20:17.716 --> 00:20:19.051
Causing us trouble?

00:20:19.785 --> 00:20:21.520
You don't have to be so considerate.

00:20:32.164 --> 00:20:36.168
Relative Poverty

00:20:37.569 --> 00:20:39.371
This is our country
we're talking about, right?

00:20:41.673 --> 00:20:48.680
And you're trying to show us that
by laying yourself bare.

00:20:51.316 --> 00:20:54.519
Saying that you're bothering us
honestly makes me sad.

00:20:56.622 --> 00:20:59.524
Right now, there's nothing more
important than listening to you.

00:21:00.792 --> 00:21:02.327
At least, that's how I feel.

00:21:11.570 --> 00:21:13.305
"The personal is political."

00:21:13.372 --> 00:21:15.841
That's what
my late brother taught me.

00:21:17.709 --> 00:21:19.911
Personal struggles
are political struggles.

00:21:21.146 --> 00:21:25.484
The difficulties Shiiba faces
are connected to our society.

00:21:26.451 --> 00:21:27.986
They're connected to politics.

00:21:29.221 --> 00:21:32.090
They're connected to whether or not
we'll have a better future.

00:21:33.558 --> 00:21:35.260
This is not just Shiiba's problem.

00:21:44.403 --> 00:21:48.807
What triggered my punishment
was shoplifting.

00:21:51.310 --> 00:21:54.780
But what sealed the decision...

00:21:58.884 --> 00:22:00.185
was my part-time job.

00:22:03.055 --> 00:22:05.057
I was working a fake profile
on a dating app.

00:22:09.695 --> 00:22:14.800
It's a job that
could be considered fraud.

00:22:16.935 --> 00:22:17.936
But...

00:22:20.238 --> 00:22:24.276
I could do it from home,
and the hourly wage was good.

00:22:27.279 --> 00:22:28.613
I couldn't turn back.

00:22:37.723 --> 00:22:39.157
Why menstrual products?

00:22:42.694 --> 00:22:45.364
What Shiiba took from the drugstore
were menstrual products.

00:22:45.464 --> 00:22:46.531
Stop it!

00:22:46.631 --> 00:22:47.632
Why?

00:22:47.733 --> 00:22:50.268
That's not a question to ask a woman.
I won't allow it.

00:22:50.369 --> 00:22:51.570
Shiiba should be the one to decide.

00:22:52.971 --> 00:22:53.972
What?

00:22:54.072 --> 00:22:57.042
Whether to be angry
at the question, or to answer it...

00:22:59.678 --> 00:23:01.146
I think Shiiba should decide that.

00:23:02.547 --> 00:23:04.015
After all, it's about her.

00:23:13.158 --> 00:23:20.065
I came here today to talk about that.

00:23:26.037 --> 00:23:30.509
Because Mr. Mikami asked me to.

00:23:32.411 --> 00:23:33.812
Can you tell everyone?

00:23:34.212 --> 00:23:35.480
Do you want to?

00:23:36.581 --> 00:23:37.949
Tell them what?

00:23:38.483 --> 00:23:41.186
The reason you had to steal these.

00:23:53.498 --> 00:23:57.569
My grandfather runs
a Japanese confectionery shop.

00:23:58.804 --> 00:24:00.372
He sells red bean rice.

00:24:01.640 --> 00:24:06.144
In our neighborhood, everyone
celebrates a girl's first period

00:24:06.244 --> 00:24:07.646
with red bean rice.

00:24:08.980 --> 00:24:10.215
Because of that

00:24:11.316 --> 00:24:15.754
I grew up believing that having
your period was a good thing

00:24:16.521 --> 00:24:20.692
and that it was
something important for a girl.

00:24:25.864 --> 00:24:31.570
What was once precious to me
became something just painful.

00:24:33.572 --> 00:24:36.842
It started after
things at home went downhill.

00:24:38.477 --> 00:24:42.547
I had to
figure everything out myself

00:24:44.749 --> 00:24:46.451
or else nothing could move forward.

00:24:49.120 --> 00:24:51.223
Financial problems scare me the most.

00:24:54.359 --> 00:24:56.261
I know I'll have to sell the shop.

00:24:59.564 --> 00:25:01.466
And I know I'll have to

00:25:03.268 --> 00:25:05.904
put my grandparents
in a care facility.

00:25:09.341 --> 00:25:12.644
But whenever
I try to think about it...

00:25:14.679 --> 00:25:16.381
my head would get overwhelmed

00:25:18.783 --> 00:25:22.787
and my body would get
heavier and heavier.

00:25:26.992 --> 00:25:28.493
I'm sorry, Shiiba.

00:25:30.729 --> 00:25:32.330
I'm sorry I didn't notice.

00:25:32.898 --> 00:25:35.200
I'm so, so sorry.

00:25:36.067 --> 00:25:37.636
Don't apologize, Chigira.

00:25:41.339 --> 00:25:45.277
I knew you were
really worried about me.

00:25:47.679 --> 00:25:52.050
But when you're truly,
truly struggling...

00:25:54.486 --> 00:25:57.022
you have to
dull something inside yourself.

00:26:02.694 --> 00:26:05.964
Or it just becomes
impossible to live.

00:26:08.733 --> 00:26:13.438
You stop even realizing that
there are people you could talk to.

00:26:16.074 --> 00:26:17.409
And yet, my period would come

00:26:18.977 --> 00:26:23.915
forcing me to realize that
I'm still alive.

00:26:26.718 --> 00:26:27.719
I'm...

00:26:31.756 --> 00:26:33.858
I'm bleeding here.

00:26:36.227 --> 00:26:37.929
And yet nobody notices.

00:26:40.465 --> 00:26:41.533
It hurt.

00:26:44.035 --> 00:26:50.575
I realized that
what I really wanted...

00:26:55.113 --> 00:26:59.351
was for someone to
notice that I'm here.

00:27:03.455 --> 00:27:06.491
Thank you for listening.

00:27:14.699 --> 00:27:19.304
Thank you for sharing
something so important.

00:27:27.245 --> 00:27:28.246
So...

00:27:28.880 --> 00:27:29.881
What?

00:27:32.350 --> 00:27:37.622
In this situation, where exactly
should we direct our protest?

00:27:49.934 --> 00:27:51.302
Let's think about it.

00:27:51.836 --> 00:27:52.871
Let's figure out how.

00:27:55.273 --> 00:27:56.541
All right.

00:27:57.842 --> 00:27:59.144
Let's do this!

00:28:00.779 --> 00:28:01.780
What?

00:28:03.381 --> 00:28:08.053
If we miss the boat now,
us guys will be behind forever.

00:28:08.753 --> 00:28:10.555
So I figured I'd better get serious.

00:28:11.356 --> 00:28:13.091
There's not a single person
in this world

00:28:13.158 --> 00:28:15.560
who isn't connected to
menstruation in some way.

00:28:15.694 --> 00:28:19.531
First, we'll start with research.

00:28:19.631 --> 00:28:22.634
Let's meet in the PC room
after school.

00:28:24.169 --> 00:28:27.105
Hold on.
Maybe we should assign roles first?

00:28:27.305 --> 00:28:29.908
If it's class notes, leave it to me.

00:28:30.008 --> 00:28:31.142
I'll help too.

00:29:17.722 --> 00:29:19.724
Sorry, I forgot to erase the board.

00:29:19.824 --> 00:29:21.092
It's fine.

00:29:21.192 --> 00:29:23.528
Everyone's got stuff to do.
I can handle this.

00:29:26.965 --> 00:29:29.434
What is it? Sorry, was I
not supposed to erase this?

00:29:29.834 --> 00:29:32.737
Should I say it, or not?

00:29:33.238 --> 00:29:34.873
What are you trying to say?

00:29:37.008 --> 00:29:40.044
Ms. Koreeda.
You're feeling down, right?

00:29:40.678 --> 00:29:42.280
No, not really.

00:29:42.714 --> 00:29:44.783
You're regretting stepping in
back there, aren't you?

00:29:45.283 --> 00:29:47.252
Blaming yourself for
ruining the moment.

00:29:48.419 --> 00:29:51.256
Actually, Okami had
asked me about it.

00:29:51.689 --> 00:29:52.690
What?

00:29:53.158 --> 00:29:55.260
He told me, "I know
Ms. Koreeda will try to stop me.

00:29:55.693 --> 00:29:57.328
So would you mind stepping in?"

00:29:59.164 --> 00:30:02.267
I said it would be easier to
talk to you about it first

00:30:02.333 --> 00:30:03.334
but he said...

00:30:04.002 --> 00:30:07.972
Even if we're on the same page,
having someone who will

00:30:08.072 --> 00:30:11.776
protect you with all they've got
makes all the difference.

00:30:16.014 --> 00:30:21.152
Okami truly believed that
you would protect Shiiba.

00:30:31.196 --> 00:30:32.664
The Reality Children Face at School
Due to Relative Poverty

00:30:32.764 --> 00:30:34.332
1 in 2 Single-Mother Households
Lives in Relative Poverty

00:30:38.436 --> 00:30:41.206
Sorry to interrupt,
but I want you to see this.

00:30:41.606 --> 00:30:43.808
If we had proper counseling systems
and support at school...

00:30:44.776 --> 00:30:46.578
Excuse me, is now a good time?

00:30:46.978 --> 00:30:48.913
Could we have
a moment of your time?

00:30:49.380 --> 00:30:51.482
This is about one of our classmates.

00:30:52.650 --> 00:30:53.852
We'll collect it here.

00:30:54.252 --> 00:30:55.653
Thank you very much.

00:30:55.887 --> 00:30:57.655
This is regarding relative poverty...

00:30:57.889 --> 00:30:59.457
Have you heard the term
"period poverty"?

00:30:59.624 --> 00:31:02.694
This is a very real and
pressing issue for women.

00:31:02.961 --> 00:31:04.329
She's my best friend.

00:31:04.429 --> 00:31:07.398
Amazing. This is almost
the entire student body.

00:31:07.565 --> 00:31:09.734
We're requesting to rescind
Shiiba Haruno's expulsion

00:31:10.368 --> 00:31:12.237
and that a support system
be established for students

00:31:12.670 --> 00:31:15.206
whose family situations worsen.

00:31:16.274 --> 00:31:17.408
Understood.

00:31:19.043 --> 00:31:20.111
We will consider it.

00:31:20.278 --> 00:31:22.914
– Thank you.
– Thank you very much.

00:31:32.891 --> 00:31:35.393
– Excuse me.
– Excuse me.

00:31:38.730 --> 00:31:41.366
Our students are politically aware.

00:31:41.599 --> 00:31:43.401
You had to have seen this coming.

00:31:43.835 --> 00:31:47.238
Was it not you who insisted on
expulsion, Chairman Kodai?

00:31:47.338 --> 00:31:50.541
I said her actions
must have consequences.

00:31:50.909 --> 00:31:54.145
But, at any rate, these are
what we received in the end.

00:32:00.385 --> 00:32:03.621
Apparently, the chairman
has a statement to make.

00:32:03.721 --> 00:32:06.090
– What?
– Is it about Shiiba?

00:32:06.624 --> 00:32:08.092
I'm not sure.

00:32:09.460 --> 00:32:10.561
Here it comes.

00:32:17.435 --> 00:32:19.237
They've made a decision about Shiiba.

00:32:19.504 --> 00:32:20.505
– What?
– Really?

00:32:20.571 --> 00:32:24.876
In regard to that, Chairman Kodai
has a message for you all.

00:32:33.384 --> 00:32:34.385
Please come in.

00:32:35.253 --> 00:32:36.254
Hi there.

00:32:36.354 --> 00:32:37.488
Mr. Makino.

00:32:43.528 --> 00:32:45.129
I heard your test results came back.

00:32:45.730 --> 00:32:46.731
Yes.

00:32:47.832 --> 00:32:50.335
Apparently, one of the arteries
in my brain was nearly blocked.

00:32:51.135 --> 00:32:53.104
It's worse than they expected.

00:32:53.304 --> 00:32:55.907
They put me on strict bed rest
until surgery.

00:32:58.710 --> 00:33:00.945
It's got to be from
all that yakiniku, right?

00:33:03.181 --> 00:33:06.017
So I spent my own money
only to nearly kill a subordinate?

00:33:07.986 --> 00:33:11.422
Well, that stinks.

00:33:14.158 --> 00:33:16.394
What's worse, the surgery date is

00:33:19.430 --> 00:33:20.898
the same as my wife's due date.

00:33:23.835 --> 00:33:26.604
Why are we even doing this job?

00:33:29.173 --> 00:33:30.208
Seriously.

00:33:54.365 --> 00:33:59.003
Shiinoha

00:34:01.105 --> 00:34:04.175
At this time, the board of directors,
the board of trustees

00:34:04.942 --> 00:34:06.844
as well as the entire faculty

00:34:07.445 --> 00:34:12.250
have looked at your petition
with both great surprise and joy.

00:34:13.651 --> 00:34:17.722
Seeing your signatures
made us realize

00:34:17.889 --> 00:34:20.625
just how narrow-minded we were.

00:34:22.360 --> 00:34:26.664
I've always hoped to
educate our students to be virtuous

00:34:27.899 --> 00:34:33.738
and to have a spirit of
helping those around them.

00:34:35.139 --> 00:34:39.410
This time, I feel that
you all reminded me of

00:34:40.311 --> 00:34:44.182
our founding ideals.

00:34:45.083 --> 00:34:48.319
Therefore, Haruno Shiiba's
expulsion will be revoked.

00:34:48.553 --> 00:34:49.620
What?

00:34:49.754 --> 00:34:53.458
Furthermore, we promise to establish
a system to support students

00:34:53.558 --> 00:34:57.895
whose economic circumstances
change after enrollment.

00:34:57.995 --> 00:35:00.431
– Yes!
– We did it!

00:35:03.034 --> 00:35:04.335
Yeah!

00:35:04.569 --> 00:35:05.770
Congrats!

00:35:07.071 --> 00:35:08.072
We did it!

00:35:09.207 --> 00:35:10.608
Yes!

00:35:12.710 --> 00:35:13.778
Thank goodness!

00:35:14.946 --> 00:35:16.180
I hope she comes back soon.

00:35:18.449 --> 00:35:22.954
I heard from Tominaga that
you secretly asked her for help.

00:35:24.322 --> 00:35:26.958
Why not just tell me directly?

00:35:28.459 --> 00:35:30.461
Wow, Tominaga spilled the beans?

00:35:30.561 --> 00:35:32.497
If I had known about it...

00:35:32.597 --> 00:35:36.234
I knew that this couldn't be resolved
without your help, Ms. Koreeda.

00:35:36.534 --> 00:35:39.170
– But...
– But what?

00:35:39.403 --> 00:35:41.839
You're not the kind of person who
can lie to get things done, are you?

00:35:44.442 --> 00:35:49.714
That's exactly why you can stand
beside the students, eye-to-eye.

00:35:50.982 --> 00:35:52.416
That's not true.

00:35:53.151 --> 00:35:55.786
Is there another
co-homeroom teacher here

00:35:55.887 --> 00:35:58.089
who attends every single
homeroom period?

00:35:58.389 --> 00:36:02.126
– That was your idea.
– Yes, I proposed it.

00:36:02.593 --> 00:36:05.696
But, you were the one who chose
to be there for the students

00:36:05.796 --> 00:36:07.198
instead of clinging to
pride or position.

00:36:14.705 --> 00:36:18.476
I used to think being
"as competent as a man"

00:36:19.010 --> 00:36:20.778
was a compliment.

00:36:22.313 --> 00:36:25.016
I pushed myself to live up to that.

00:36:28.819 --> 00:36:30.288
But, I realize now
that's not the case.

00:36:31.689 --> 00:36:35.193
A society built on that mindset
is what has led us here.

00:36:35.893 --> 00:36:37.195
That's true.

00:36:39.997 --> 00:36:42.066
I'll just do my job.

00:36:43.367 --> 00:36:44.869
That's all I can do, right?

00:36:46.804 --> 00:36:50.308
And that's the hardest thing,
isn't it?

00:36:52.376 --> 00:36:53.377
Yes.

00:36:56.547 --> 00:36:58.182
– Can I ask you something?
– What is it?

00:36:58.282 --> 00:37:02.186
You know I came here thanks to
my family's influence, right?

00:37:02.420 --> 00:37:03.421
Yes.

00:37:06.958 --> 00:37:08.726
My mother is a strict woman.

00:37:10.094 --> 00:37:12.697
She was against me becoming
a teacher in the first place.

00:37:14.665 --> 00:37:18.736
But I wanted to be a teacher
who not only teaches academics

00:37:18.803 --> 00:37:25.176
but also faces students'
problems head-on.

00:37:27.878 --> 00:37:32.149
So, I deliberately chose
a high school in a rough area.

00:37:32.583 --> 00:37:34.652
That made her really angry.

00:37:34.952 --> 00:37:36.320
Is that right?

00:37:37.421 --> 00:37:40.324
She turned down that school
behind my back

00:37:41.125 --> 00:37:42.293
she chose this one for me instead.

00:37:45.329 --> 00:37:49.166
Even now, I regret
going along with it.

00:37:50.101 --> 00:37:51.802
Did you maybe want to
become one of those

00:37:51.902 --> 00:37:52.970
"super passionate teachers"?

00:37:54.705 --> 00:37:56.907
– I figured you'd say that.
– Sorry.

00:37:59.877 --> 00:38:03.180
And so I ended up at Rintoku
not by choice.

00:38:04.348 --> 00:38:06.284
But, I've come to think
it's a really good school.

00:38:07.618 --> 00:38:09.520
Its values are something
to be proud of

00:38:10.354 --> 00:38:13.591
and Chairman Kodai seemed like
someone worthy of respect.

00:38:15.626 --> 00:38:21.132
But after that whole fax thing
and today's announcement...

00:38:22.533 --> 00:38:24.468
I realized it's
not about the students.

00:38:24.568 --> 00:38:27.872
It's always about him
being the main character.

00:38:29.040 --> 00:38:32.410
It's like he's just
drunk on his own words.

00:38:36.147 --> 00:38:40.151
So I think I'll try talking
to my mother.

00:38:41.552 --> 00:38:43.187
I'll tell her that Chairman Kodai

00:38:43.287 --> 00:38:46.123
might be straying
from the right path.

00:38:49.093 --> 00:38:50.194
And if that's the case

00:38:51.395 --> 00:38:53.764
I have to protect my students.

00:38:59.737 --> 00:39:02.239
Continuation and Effective
Utilization of Shiinoha

00:39:02.340 --> 00:39:03.341
What's this?

00:39:03.974 --> 00:39:07.478
Thanks to you mustering up
your courage, we learned a lot.

00:39:09.013 --> 00:39:10.948
Of course it's important for
the girls,

00:39:11.649 --> 00:39:15.286
but it's just as important
for the boys too.

00:39:15.886 --> 00:39:17.221
That's how everyone feels.

00:39:17.621 --> 00:39:19.623
So, we thought this was
the least we could do.

00:39:22.426 --> 00:39:25.296
Wouldn't it be great if the
confectionery shop Shiinoha

00:39:25.396 --> 00:39:28.432
could stay open with the same name?

00:39:28.966 --> 00:39:31.635
No way. That's impossible.

00:39:31.969 --> 00:39:32.970
Why?

00:39:33.070 --> 00:39:35.940
Japanese confectionery shops
aren't doing well anymore.

00:39:36.107 --> 00:39:37.641
There aren't many successors either.

00:39:37.875 --> 00:39:40.544
But Shiinoha didn't see
any drop in sales, right?

00:39:41.078 --> 00:39:44.248
Well, yeah, because we've had
loyal customers since the old days.

00:39:44.582 --> 00:39:47.318
But now,
even those connections have faded.

00:39:47.485 --> 00:39:48.652
We want you to see this.

00:39:50.888 --> 00:39:53.991
Shiinoha's old customers say that
if the shop continues

00:39:54.091 --> 00:39:55.926
they'd be happy to support it.

00:39:56.026 --> 00:39:58.295
I can't run a confectionery shop.

00:39:58.863 --> 00:40:00.464
That's why we want to match you with

00:40:00.531 --> 00:40:04.435
an artisan looking for a store,
and set up a crowdfunding campaign.

00:40:10.141 --> 00:40:11.142
Thank you.

00:40:13.110 --> 00:40:14.111
But...

00:40:16.247 --> 00:40:18.182
I've already made my decision.

00:40:19.283 --> 00:40:20.284
What do you mean?

00:40:20.751 --> 00:40:23.888
My uncle on my mother's side
is a realtor.

00:40:24.355 --> 00:40:27.091
I finally reached out to him.

00:40:27.691 --> 00:40:31.195
Wait, does that mean
you're selling Shiinoha?

00:40:32.997 --> 00:40:33.998
Yeah.

00:40:35.032 --> 00:40:36.367
Are you okay with that?

00:40:37.835 --> 00:40:39.837
All this time...

00:40:39.904 --> 00:40:44.842
I was too proud to ask for help.

00:40:46.477 --> 00:40:47.745
But I finally said it.

00:40:49.547 --> 00:40:53.584
Because all of you taught me
the courage to ask for help.

00:40:56.287 --> 00:40:57.655
What did your uncle say?

00:40:59.223 --> 00:41:02.193
He said, "I've always been ready
to do whatever it takes

00:41:02.293 --> 00:41:03.828
if you needed help, Haruno."

00:41:04.195 --> 00:41:07.498
Then, if he would just take a look
at these documents, I'm sure...

00:41:07.698 --> 00:41:10.367
My dad said this could really work.

00:41:12.636 --> 00:41:15.606
Wow, you guys are amazing.

00:41:16.340 --> 00:41:20.344
I would've never come up
with something like this.

00:41:21.679 --> 00:41:22.746
In that case...

00:41:24.982 --> 00:41:26.450
Why not give it a try, Shiiba?

00:41:31.388 --> 00:41:32.423
But...

00:41:38.729 --> 00:41:39.730
I don't know.

00:41:43.234 --> 00:41:45.803
If it's not my grandpa's flavor...

00:41:47.571 --> 00:41:50.241
then I don't think
it's really "Shiinoha."

00:41:56.146 --> 00:42:00.484
But, I'm really happy
you did this for me.

00:42:01.719 --> 00:42:04.221
The fact that I can
actually feel happy right now...

00:42:05.656 --> 00:42:08.492
That alone makes me really happy.

00:42:12.696 --> 00:42:13.998
If I ever lose my way again...

00:42:17.668 --> 00:42:19.970
Can I come ask you all for help?

00:42:20.404 --> 00:42:22.773
Of course! Right?

00:42:23.474 --> 00:42:24.475
Yes.

00:42:28.345 --> 00:42:29.813
It's a promise, okay?

00:42:30.481 --> 00:42:31.515
Yeah, thank you.

00:42:33.384 --> 00:42:36.120
Team BizCon will
absolutely support you too!

00:42:37.488 --> 00:42:38.489
Thank you.

00:42:39.890 --> 00:42:44.995
I heard that the grades in
Mikami's class have dropped.

00:42:45.930 --> 00:42:48.899
So, I have a proposal.

00:42:50.834 --> 00:42:51.936
What?

00:42:52.002 --> 00:42:54.038
You're suggesting we send Mr. Mikami
back to the Ministry of Education?

00:42:54.305 --> 00:42:58.576
Well, we're concerned that
he might cause further trouble

00:42:58.676 --> 00:42:59.944
if this continues.

00:43:00.144 --> 00:43:05.182
Actually, I sense a lot of
potential in Mr. Mikami.

00:43:05.816 --> 00:43:09.186
I believe he could
take Rintoku to the next level.

00:43:09.887 --> 00:43:11.121
That is true.

00:43:11.188 --> 00:43:12.957
He's definitely a man with potential.

00:43:14.458 --> 00:43:17.895
I'm glad to hear you say that.

00:43:19.997 --> 00:43:23.634
If you really feel that way

00:43:23.701 --> 00:43:24.902
then how about this?

00:43:26.070 --> 00:43:31.508
You can draw him in and
keep him close while we still can.

00:43:37.748 --> 00:43:42.519
Mikami probably doesn't
want to leave Rintoku right now.

00:43:42.953 --> 00:43:45.723
So, let's have him improve
his class's performance first.

00:43:45.823 --> 00:43:49.560
And after that, we either
bring him over to our side...

00:43:51.595 --> 00:43:52.730
or we cut him off.

00:43:58.669 --> 00:43:59.670
Mikami.

00:44:01.472 --> 00:44:02.473
Makino.

00:44:03.974 --> 00:44:05.009
Nakaoka.

00:44:06.810 --> 00:44:07.811
Mizohata.

00:44:10.447 --> 00:44:17.454
It's time to figure out who to keep,
and who to turn into allies.

00:44:19.023 --> 00:44:20.124
Understood.

00:44:21.458 --> 00:44:23.394
Well then, talk to you again.

00:44:56.026 --> 00:44:59.396
It seems like we're moving forward,
but we're actually stuck.

00:45:00.497 --> 00:45:02.766
Even if there was
an illegitimate admission

00:45:03.133 --> 00:45:05.969
just receiving a donation
won't get the prosecutors involved.

00:45:07.104 --> 00:45:08.706
Unless we have clear evidence that

00:45:08.772 --> 00:45:10.774
improper benefits were obtained
from Nagatacho or Kasumigaseki...

00:45:11.241 --> 00:45:15.279
And whether or not
Ms. Saejima was involved...

00:45:18.115 --> 00:45:20.584
Once it all connects,
it'll probably come together fast.

00:45:21.418 --> 00:45:22.986
You're right.

00:45:23.454 --> 00:45:26.857
But, we can't just
sit here and do nothing.

00:45:27.458 --> 00:45:29.426
Do you know anything about this case?

00:45:29.626 --> 00:45:30.627
No, we don't.

00:45:30.728 --> 00:45:33.397
Let's try using this.

00:45:37.367 --> 00:45:39.236
This school is
engaged in illicit behavior.

00:45:39.303 --> 00:45:41.839
– I'm not about to let this slide.
– There's no concrete evidence.

00:45:41.905 --> 00:45:42.906
We must not allow
a precedent to be set

00:45:43.006 --> 00:45:44.007
where a homeroom teacher is replaced.

00:45:44.074 --> 00:45:45.609
This is your last chance.

00:45:45.709 --> 00:45:46.977
It would be a big problem for you

00:45:47.044 --> 00:45:48.312
if everything
came to light, wouldn't it?

00:45:48.412 --> 00:45:50.881
It’s unforgivable
to make money off children’s lives.

00:45:50.981 --> 00:45:52.716
Eventually,
they'll all become troublesome.

00:45:53.283 --> 00:45:54.752
These men know too much.

00:45:55.385 --> 00:45:57.488
This is about my student.

00:45:57.588 --> 00:45:59.022
There's something
I'd like your help with.

00:45:59.089 --> 00:46:00.424
It's Plan Okami Two.
