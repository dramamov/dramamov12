WEBVTT

00:00:04.004 --> 00:00:08.942
Minori told you, right?
Once the money comes in, we move.

00:00:11.411 --> 00:00:13.279
His condition sounds serious.

00:00:13.780 --> 00:00:16.116
He might not have more
than a few months.

00:00:18.651 --> 00:00:22.789
I'm sending you the photos
from the dinner party.

00:00:25.458 --> 00:00:28.695
His mom has been working
against me, too!

00:00:31.531 --> 00:00:34.300
They are creating a new family?

00:00:47.647 --> 00:00:48.648
I'll never

00:00:51.551 --> 00:00:52.652
forgive them!

00:00:57.323 --> 00:00:59.059
When are we getting the money?

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:05.065
We're running out of time!
What's the point of marrying her?

00:01:12.639 --> 00:01:15.308
Thank you for the brooch.

00:01:15.375 --> 00:01:17.977
Glad he went to the hospital.

00:01:18.044 --> 00:01:19.846
I didn't have to give the present!

00:01:22.582 --> 00:01:24.417
Looks great on you!

00:01:25.318 --> 00:01:27.187
I'll pass it on to you, Riko!

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:30.256
Goodness! Thank you so much!

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:31.925
How's it going over there?

00:01:32.192 --> 00:01:36.229
I'll buy some cake
and play a nice mother-in-law.

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:38.832
I owe you. Thank you.

00:02:11.965 --> 00:02:13.099
Hello!

00:02:14.701 --> 00:02:18.438
I got some shortcake!
You like it, don't you?

00:02:19.139 --> 00:02:21.407
Yes, thank you.

00:02:24.244 --> 00:02:25.478
Let's see.

00:02:26.312 --> 00:02:30.583
I'll make some nice hot tea.
Minori, tea or coffee?

00:02:31.818 --> 00:02:33.153
Whatever you're having.

00:02:33.553 --> 00:02:34.754
Are you sure?

00:02:35.054 --> 00:02:36.789
Well, how about this?

00:02:36.856 --> 00:02:38.091
Someone gave it to me.

00:02:43.463 --> 00:02:47.433
All your kindness was a lie.

00:02:48.434 --> 00:02:49.435
You...

00:02:50.236 --> 00:02:52.839
only wanted my money.

00:02:55.842 --> 00:03:01.181
At last, our long-awaited plan
is coming together.

00:03:02.649 --> 00:03:05.285
Our life is about to begin!

00:03:17.497 --> 00:03:18.565
You, too...

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:21.968
are beyond forgiveness.

00:04:16.923 --> 00:04:21.961
UNTIL I DESTROYED
MY HUSBAND'S OTHER FAMILY

00:04:31.571 --> 00:04:33.406
This is so good!

00:04:35.174 --> 00:04:36.175
Honestly

00:04:37.744 --> 00:04:39.912
I want to spit it right in your face.

00:04:40.747 --> 00:04:43.383
You are so thoughtful. Thank you.

00:04:45.818 --> 00:04:48.821
Of course. We're family.

00:04:51.457 --> 00:04:54.127
Some "family" you are.
You make me laugh.

00:04:55.928 --> 00:04:56.963
Do you think

00:04:58.064 --> 00:05:01.734
I could be a wonderful mom like you?

00:05:02.568 --> 00:05:06.105
You're a much better mom, Minori!

00:05:06.706 --> 00:05:09.509
I was working all the time
when Yudai was young.

00:05:09.842 --> 00:05:11.644
I couldn't spend much time with him.

00:05:12.211 --> 00:05:13.746
I didn't know that.

00:05:16.916 --> 00:05:18.184
How did Yudai and she

00:05:19.552 --> 00:05:21.988
learn about my money?

00:05:24.490 --> 00:05:28.895
Do they have any connections
with the Tsukishiro Group?

00:05:30.997 --> 00:05:32.165
By the way

00:05:33.132 --> 00:05:37.737
you never told me about
when you were younger.

00:05:38.905 --> 00:05:41.441
There's nothing interesting to tell.

00:05:42.241 --> 00:05:44.010
I want to hear!

00:05:45.011 --> 00:05:47.146
- Do you?
- Absolutely!

00:05:48.815 --> 00:05:49.816
Well...

00:05:52.318 --> 00:05:54.654
I've kept this a secret.

00:05:55.188 --> 00:05:56.322
What is it?

00:06:01.961 --> 00:06:03.262
Me in my younger days.

00:06:03.863 --> 00:06:05.898
Believe it or not,
I used to be pretty popular.

00:06:09.469 --> 00:06:11.904
Oh, my gosh! You're so cute.

00:06:11.971 --> 00:06:14.073
This is sure to turn heads.

00:06:14.140 --> 00:06:17.844
I met Yudai's dad through this work
related to a pageant.

00:06:18.511 --> 00:06:20.446
We got married and moved to Tokyo.

00:06:21.781 --> 00:06:25.718
But he turned out to be a gambler.

00:06:26.719 --> 00:06:28.488
He racked up a ton of debt

00:06:29.188 --> 00:06:31.290
and quickly got in over his head.

00:06:33.126 --> 00:06:35.361
So you took the young Yudai

00:06:36.062 --> 00:06:37.630
and left him.

00:06:38.798 --> 00:06:39.799
Yes.

00:06:40.967 --> 00:06:43.503
But it didn't get
any easier after that.

00:06:49.041 --> 00:06:51.477
I worked day and night.

00:06:55.548 --> 00:06:58.718
And still, we could barely eat.

00:07:07.560 --> 00:07:10.396
I feel sorry for what my son
had to endure.

00:07:12.265 --> 00:07:14.333
Yudai, come!

00:07:18.438 --> 00:07:20.873
You'll show them what you're made of.

00:07:21.874 --> 00:07:23.509
HOUSEKEEPER WANTED

00:07:23.576 --> 00:07:27.413
Then I got a job at the house
of the president of a big company.

00:07:28.614 --> 00:07:30.550
The president of a big company?

00:07:30.716 --> 00:07:33.486
Here is a premium piece
I've selected for you.

00:07:35.421 --> 00:07:37.156
- How beautiful!
- Please.

00:07:37.223 --> 00:07:39.258
Pick it up and take a closer look.

00:07:39.826 --> 00:07:41.894
My wife has the earrings
in that series.

00:07:44.697 --> 00:07:45.932
More champagne, please.

00:07:49.802 --> 00:07:52.905
After I became a housekeeper,
my life changed.

00:07:54.640 --> 00:07:55.741
Changed how?

00:07:56.809 --> 00:07:59.879
Through doing housework as a job,
I built my confidence.

00:08:01.347 --> 00:08:04.717
I also found a true friend
for the first time.

00:08:05.585 --> 00:08:07.520
She was a young employee.

00:08:10.890 --> 00:08:12.391
- Great work.
- Thank you.

00:08:13.893 --> 00:08:15.728
- Sarubobo!
- What?

00:08:16.329 --> 00:08:19.198
I'm sorry. That charm
is from my hometown, so...

00:08:19.565 --> 00:08:23.569
Really? I was there, too,
until I was six.

00:08:24.570 --> 00:08:25.571
Oh, my goodness!

00:08:26.072 --> 00:08:29.842
I've never come across someone
from my hometown in Tokyo.

00:08:32.311 --> 00:08:33.679
But she was...

00:08:35.681 --> 00:08:37.617
having an affair.

00:08:41.821 --> 00:08:43.189
I'll get you more tea.

00:08:46.792 --> 00:08:49.962
Could she be...

00:08:58.137 --> 00:09:00.006
This is really good. Take it.

00:09:00.373 --> 00:09:03.376
Thank you! I'd love it!

00:09:04.944 --> 00:09:07.213
- See you.
- Thank you.

00:09:15.021 --> 00:09:18.524
- Thank you for waiting.
- What do you want to eat today?

00:09:18.858 --> 00:09:19.959
Oh, watch out.

00:09:20.159 --> 00:09:22.762
She suddenly grew distant

00:09:23.062 --> 00:09:27.166
to conceal her affair with the future
president, Susumu Tsukishiro.

00:09:36.475 --> 00:09:38.277
She might be in the shadows now

00:09:39.011 --> 00:09:42.615
but she could become
Mrs. Tsukishiro someday.

00:09:43.716 --> 00:09:45.785
That left me with mixed feelings.

00:09:46.886 --> 00:09:51.891
To the Editorial Department

00:10:03.869 --> 00:10:04.870
Serves you right!

00:10:28.494 --> 00:10:30.496
- Kisaragi!
- Yes?

00:10:30.930 --> 00:10:33.099
The president wants to see you
about the tabloid.

00:10:33.966 --> 00:10:36.469
- What tabloid?
- Just come!

00:10:37.269 --> 00:10:39.205
- Hurry up! Move!
- Wait.

00:10:48.514 --> 00:10:52.018
I pleaded with her
to end the relationship.

00:10:52.785 --> 00:10:56.389
But she never listened.

00:10:58.324 --> 00:11:03.162
Sure enough,
she got dumped and quit her job.

00:11:04.330 --> 00:11:05.331
Then I heard

00:11:06.866 --> 00:11:09.068
she was in a car accident
or something.

00:11:11.437 --> 00:11:12.772
A car accident?

00:11:15.908 --> 00:11:18.511
Goodness, that got depressing.
Let's eat.

00:11:20.579 --> 00:11:24.050
She was talking about my mom,
I'm sure.

00:11:25.584 --> 00:11:27.586
When I heard she died

00:11:28.354 --> 00:11:32.391
and her daughter
was going to inherit a fortune

00:11:33.125 --> 00:11:35.795
my heart burned
with envy of the daughter, you.

00:11:37.463 --> 00:11:41.634
So she worked
at the Tsukishiro household.

00:11:42.635 --> 00:11:43.836
It all makes sense now.

00:11:45.504 --> 00:11:49.041
When I found out you were
in the same school as Yudai

00:11:49.775 --> 00:11:51.977
I knew it was a godsend.

00:11:52.712 --> 00:11:58.084
That's when I found a way to achieve
a bright, glittering future.

00:11:59.652 --> 00:12:02.922
But now, I'm truly happy

00:12:03.422 --> 00:12:05.491
because of you and Yudai.

00:12:06.959 --> 00:12:07.960
Me, too.

00:12:09.995 --> 00:12:11.764
I'm so blessed to have you

00:12:13.532 --> 00:12:14.967
as a mother-in-law.

00:12:18.671 --> 00:12:20.139
I hate you.

00:12:21.507 --> 00:12:22.508
I will never

00:12:23.576 --> 00:12:25.511
ever let you become happy.

00:12:26.912 --> 00:12:28.848
Gosh, that was good!

00:12:29.148 --> 00:12:31.650
Thank you so much for the treat.

00:12:35.721 --> 00:12:37.690
Now it's time, finally.

00:12:38.357 --> 00:12:41.994
I've been waiting for this
for a long time.

00:12:51.237 --> 00:12:52.238
Hi.

00:12:55.474 --> 00:12:56.475
Hi.

00:12:58.511 --> 00:13:01.147
Mom told me about your grandpa.

00:13:04.717 --> 00:13:05.718
It must be tough.

00:13:15.427 --> 00:13:16.428
And Tsubasa?

00:13:17.363 --> 00:13:20.099
- He's asleep.
- Thank you.

00:13:24.136 --> 00:13:27.339
I'm sorry about today. You booked
such a lovely place for us.

00:13:28.440 --> 00:13:31.277
It wasn't just any situation.
Don't you worry.

00:13:39.385 --> 00:13:40.686
You must be exhausted.

00:13:42.021 --> 00:13:43.222
You should go to bed.

00:13:51.030 --> 00:13:52.064
I think I will.

00:14:06.011 --> 00:14:07.213
But before that

00:14:09.582 --> 00:14:11.217
I want your answer.

00:14:12.651 --> 00:14:13.652
To what?

00:14:22.428 --> 00:14:23.696
To what I asked you today.

00:14:25.898 --> 00:14:27.466
You haven't answered.

00:14:29.034 --> 00:14:30.035
What?

00:14:32.071 --> 00:14:33.239
What do I...

00:14:35.808 --> 00:14:36.809
really mean to you?

00:14:38.744 --> 00:14:40.112
These 17 years...

00:14:42.514 --> 00:14:43.682
have you ever...

00:14:46.085 --> 00:14:47.753
really loved me?

00:14:50.990 --> 00:14:53.859
Do you really want me to answer?

00:14:56.395 --> 00:14:58.697
I couldn't ask this on any other day.

00:15:02.134 --> 00:15:03.168
Okay.

00:15:07.306 --> 00:15:09.775
I've never told you this before.

00:15:14.713 --> 00:15:15.948
Among us boys

00:15:17.082 --> 00:15:18.083
you were always

00:15:18.951 --> 00:15:20.452
the favorite.

00:15:29.094 --> 00:15:32.298
Was I really? I had no idea.

00:15:35.134 --> 00:15:36.969
I was too embarrassed to tell you.

00:15:41.407 --> 00:15:42.408
And?

00:15:44.710 --> 00:15:46.578
The first time we talked

00:15:47.513 --> 00:15:48.514
were you happy?

00:15:58.223 --> 00:16:00.859
Was I happy?

00:16:04.430 --> 00:16:07.433
It was more like,
"I finally did it!" I guess.

00:16:09.768 --> 00:16:11.103
It was a coincidence

00:16:11.670 --> 00:16:15.407
but that's how we ended up together.

00:16:16.709 --> 00:16:18.477
Was it really a coincidence?

00:16:20.012 --> 00:16:21.447
Weren't you waiting for a chance

00:16:22.147 --> 00:16:24.350
to get close to me?

00:16:29.021 --> 00:16:30.322
Can I get you anything?

00:16:33.158 --> 00:16:34.259
I'll have barley tea.

00:16:35.294 --> 00:16:36.295
Yes, ma'am.

00:16:44.103 --> 00:16:47.973
That day,
my destiny was set in motion.

00:16:51.910 --> 00:16:54.580
Is that girl Minori Kume?

00:16:56.715 --> 00:16:59.284
What? How do you know?

00:16:59.351 --> 00:17:00.786
A bit of history.

00:17:01.620 --> 00:17:03.856
- History?
- Anyway

00:17:05.024 --> 00:17:07.159
you should ask her out.

00:17:08.127 --> 00:17:11.030
Gosh, where did that come from?

00:17:11.730 --> 00:17:16.435
She's so cute. Feelings will grow
as you spend time together.

00:17:17.436 --> 00:17:18.437
I can't.

00:17:20.839 --> 00:17:22.241
I like someone else.

00:17:29.882 --> 00:17:31.950
Just date both
without getting caught.

00:17:35.387 --> 00:17:36.388
No way!

00:17:37.322 --> 00:17:41.326
Do you want to live your whole life
constantly worried about money?

00:17:42.561 --> 00:17:43.562
What?

00:17:44.263 --> 00:17:45.597
I don't get it.

00:17:45.664 --> 00:17:48.567
This is a huge deal for us,
you and me.

00:17:50.102 --> 00:17:51.603
If you marry her

00:17:53.038 --> 00:17:57.443
you'll never, ever have to worry
about money. We can be happy!

00:18:00.212 --> 00:18:01.747
Where is it?

00:18:01.814 --> 00:18:05.284
Honestly,
I'd had enough of being poor.

00:18:06.085 --> 00:18:07.152
So I...

00:18:07.219 --> 00:18:08.620
You're so clumsy!

00:18:09.054 --> 00:18:10.055
I'm sorry!

00:18:10.989 --> 00:18:12.091
Excuse me!

00:18:14.726 --> 00:18:15.861
Did you drop this?

00:18:16.995 --> 00:18:21.200
I asked her out,
just as Mom had planned.

00:18:22.067 --> 00:18:23.068
But...

00:18:24.736 --> 00:18:30.042
We crossed paths again as adults.
Riko had become a single mom.

00:18:31.110 --> 00:18:33.545
At that moment

00:18:33.812 --> 00:18:35.881
I remembered what Mom had said.

00:18:37.349 --> 00:18:39.351
Just date both
without getting caught.

00:18:41.920 --> 00:18:44.456
My double life is almost over.

00:18:49.094 --> 00:18:50.162
Here you go.

00:18:52.798 --> 00:18:53.799
Thank you.

00:18:59.571 --> 00:19:00.572
Hey.

00:19:02.207 --> 00:19:03.275
Tell me the truth.

00:19:04.376 --> 00:19:05.611
While we were going out...

00:19:07.713 --> 00:19:10.048
were you ever attracted
to someone else?

00:19:11.150 --> 00:19:12.151
What?

00:19:12.818 --> 00:19:14.319
Of course not.

00:19:16.021 --> 00:19:17.589
When we met in high school...

00:19:20.092 --> 00:19:21.193
I thought

00:19:22.528 --> 00:19:25.764
"Hey, maybe this is fate."

00:19:31.570 --> 00:19:33.405
If I had another life to live...

00:19:37.509 --> 00:19:38.510
I would...

00:19:44.550 --> 00:19:46.652
choose you all over again.

00:19:55.093 --> 00:19:56.094
You okay?

00:20:06.038 --> 00:20:08.707
I was savoring the feeling

00:20:09.808 --> 00:20:11.176
of being so lucky.

00:20:14.413 --> 00:20:15.414
So...

00:20:16.582 --> 00:20:17.950
to answer your question

00:20:20.586 --> 00:20:22.688
these 17 years...

00:20:27.759 --> 00:20:29.027
have truly been a blessing...

00:20:31.597 --> 00:20:33.432
because of you.

00:20:38.870 --> 00:20:40.405
Let's keep going strong.

00:20:42.841 --> 00:20:44.209
And you'd never say

00:20:45.043 --> 00:20:46.311
you love me.

00:21:05.197 --> 00:21:06.198
Dad.

00:21:11.036 --> 00:21:15.140
Cut ties with them quickly,
so they don't get a single penny.

00:21:17.142 --> 00:21:19.911
We need to get the ball rolling
on your divorce.

00:21:23.315 --> 00:21:24.316
Divorce...

00:21:31.089 --> 00:21:32.090
Okay.

00:21:34.660 --> 00:21:35.661
By the way...

00:21:37.863 --> 00:21:40.098
what happened to that woman's son?

00:21:41.199 --> 00:21:43.168
Would you do anything for me?

00:21:44.102 --> 00:21:45.170
"Anything"?

00:21:55.247 --> 00:21:56.315
I think...

00:21:59.184 --> 00:22:01.019
I'll have a job for him later.

00:22:05.390 --> 00:22:08.293
I'm looking forward
to seeing you tomorrow.

00:22:09.027 --> 00:22:10.262
I'm Minori Kume.

00:22:12.731 --> 00:22:13.832
Got something on you.

00:22:26.278 --> 00:22:28.246
Hang in there a little longer.

00:22:28.613 --> 00:22:31.049
We'll handle the divorce and marriage

00:22:31.249 --> 00:22:34.720
once her stocks are in my name
and all the preparations are done.

00:22:36.154 --> 00:22:38.423
Will it really work out that easily?

00:22:39.358 --> 00:22:42.694
There's no way she could manage
that much wealth.

00:22:42.894 --> 00:22:46.231
She'll come running to me for help,
so I'll take charge.

00:22:47.432 --> 00:22:50.535
You think you know everything
about your wife.

00:22:51.737 --> 00:22:53.138
Seventeen years!

00:22:54.106 --> 00:22:56.641
I've been with her since high school.

00:22:56.875 --> 00:22:59.344
No one understands her
better than me.

00:23:01.413 --> 00:23:03.181
Since high school...

00:23:05.083 --> 00:23:06.418
That's a pretty long time.

00:23:09.688 --> 00:23:11.823
Timing is everything in a divorce.

00:23:12.824 --> 00:23:15.794
With Tsubasa's last name
changing to Kume

00:23:15.994 --> 00:23:18.997
maybe it should be right before
his elementary school.

00:23:28.407 --> 00:23:29.408
Kume?

00:23:39.785 --> 00:23:42.287
The Study Plan approved by Ms. Kume

00:23:52.030 --> 00:23:55.434
Why didn't I see this before?
I was so blind.

00:24:04.676 --> 00:24:05.677
Is this

00:24:06.611 --> 00:24:08.046
her handwriting?

00:24:17.022 --> 00:24:19.424
Is she going to take Wataru
away from me?

00:24:34.239 --> 00:24:35.507
Where are you going?

00:24:44.082 --> 00:24:46.017
I asked where you were going.

00:24:49.521 --> 00:24:50.956
Wait!

00:24:51.089 --> 00:24:52.858
- Get out of the way.
- No, wait!

00:24:53.024 --> 00:24:54.960
You're not going to that woman!

00:24:55.527 --> 00:24:57.262
I'm not going to allow it!

00:25:07.305 --> 00:25:08.306
She is...

00:25:10.709 --> 00:25:12.677
not what you think.

00:25:15.013 --> 00:25:16.181
My grades went up

00:25:17.582 --> 00:25:19.484
because of her advice.

00:25:23.488 --> 00:25:27.425
That woman is trying
to get revenge on me.

00:25:27.592 --> 00:25:30.328
And she's using you for that!

00:25:32.664 --> 00:25:33.865
I know that.

00:25:35.433 --> 00:25:36.434
What?

00:25:37.469 --> 00:25:38.737
I know everything.

00:25:40.705 --> 00:25:41.840
Then why?

00:25:43.942 --> 00:25:45.076
Because...

00:25:47.112 --> 00:25:48.313
I still like...

00:25:51.516 --> 00:25:53.418
Enough already!

00:25:54.419 --> 00:25:57.722
You know she's lying,
and you're still going to defend her?

00:26:00.525 --> 00:26:02.594
She's the victim.

00:26:08.800 --> 00:26:10.635
You think you did nothing wrong?

00:26:13.071 --> 00:26:15.840
It was you
who went for a married man!

00:26:18.443 --> 00:26:20.211
Have you ever thought about

00:26:21.880 --> 00:26:23.682
how it feels to be cheated on?

00:26:27.819 --> 00:26:28.820
I...

00:26:31.423 --> 00:26:34.392
I had no idea
how much she was suffering.

00:26:38.496 --> 00:26:39.497
Mom.

00:26:42.467 --> 00:26:44.302
We're the ones who inflicted pain.

00:26:47.505 --> 00:26:48.540
I just thought...

00:26:49.908 --> 00:26:50.976
I just wanted

00:26:51.676 --> 00:26:54.412
you to have a dad.

00:26:55.213 --> 00:26:57.382
That's just your selfish agenda.

00:27:00.185 --> 00:27:02.621
You're blaming me for your affair?

00:27:02.921 --> 00:27:06.324
No! That's not what I'm saying!

00:27:10.528 --> 00:27:11.529
Do you...

00:27:12.564 --> 00:27:17.068
Do you have any idea
how much I've done to raise you?

00:27:18.803 --> 00:27:20.338
Hell if I know!

00:27:21.172 --> 00:27:24.542
- Wataru, wait!
- Don't touch me!

00:27:24.776 --> 00:27:26.778
- Wataru!
- Let me go!

00:28:01.179 --> 00:28:02.180
Yes?

00:28:08.653 --> 00:28:09.821
What happened?

00:28:12.524 --> 00:28:13.525
Come in.

00:28:23.568 --> 00:28:25.970
Here, you're going to catch a cold.

00:28:34.212 --> 00:28:35.413
What happened?

00:28:38.950 --> 00:28:39.951
Towel.

00:28:44.622 --> 00:28:45.623
I'm sorry.

00:28:47.425 --> 00:28:49.394
You can use this towel.

00:28:56.234 --> 00:28:57.402
I wanted to see you.

00:29:11.616 --> 00:29:12.617
There.

00:29:14.252 --> 00:29:15.487
So, what is it?

00:29:16.955 --> 00:29:18.423
Something you can tell me?

00:29:24.295 --> 00:29:25.296
I...

00:29:26.564 --> 00:29:27.599
left home.

00:29:30.668 --> 00:29:31.669
What?

00:29:35.006 --> 00:29:36.007
You asked me

00:29:37.242 --> 00:29:39.878
if I would do anything for you.

00:29:45.283 --> 00:29:46.284
I am...

00:29:48.520 --> 00:29:50.054
on your side.

00:29:53.158 --> 00:29:54.159
I know

00:29:56.194 --> 00:29:57.395
you want revenge.

00:30:01.266 --> 00:30:02.567
It's my mom's fault.

00:30:05.970 --> 00:30:07.338
She hurt you so much.

00:30:10.608 --> 00:30:11.709
I'm really sorry.

00:30:16.681 --> 00:30:17.682
No.

00:30:19.617 --> 00:30:20.618
Don't apologize.

00:30:22.086 --> 00:30:23.154
Please.

00:30:27.592 --> 00:30:28.593
Minori.

00:30:30.228 --> 00:30:31.229
I...

00:30:34.632 --> 00:30:36.000
Don't say any more.

00:30:38.770 --> 00:30:40.371
I can't stop now.

00:30:44.309 --> 00:30:45.510
Then...

00:30:49.147 --> 00:30:50.615
what should I do?

00:30:56.020 --> 00:30:57.488
What can I do...

00:31:01.593 --> 00:31:03.294
for you to forgive us?

00:31:19.644 --> 00:31:21.679
Good. It's cleared up.

00:31:25.817 --> 00:31:26.818
Okay.

00:31:27.819 --> 00:31:28.853
Take care.

00:32:04.522 --> 00:32:05.556
Forgot something?

00:32:07.959 --> 00:32:08.960
Miss Muto.

00:32:09.527 --> 00:32:11.963
What do you think you're doing?

00:32:12.964 --> 00:32:13.965
What?

00:32:14.465 --> 00:32:15.566
I was watching.

00:32:16.801 --> 00:32:19.504
You invited your former student
to your home.

00:32:22.006 --> 00:32:24.509
It's not like that. It was raining.

00:32:24.575 --> 00:32:26.244
Don't you have any shame?

00:32:27.278 --> 00:32:29.614
Really, you're misunderstanding.

00:32:31.416 --> 00:32:34.252
So, can you tell people what you did?

00:32:35.920 --> 00:32:36.921
What?

00:32:38.122 --> 00:32:40.658
Wataru has exams this year.

00:32:41.793 --> 00:32:44.629
This year could decide
his whole future.

00:32:46.931 --> 00:32:49.600
Do you enjoy toying
with people's lives?

00:32:53.905 --> 00:32:55.206
That's low.

00:32:59.644 --> 00:33:00.912
Disgusting.

00:33:06.651 --> 00:33:08.019
I will never...

00:33:11.189 --> 00:33:12.790
forgive you, ever.

00:33:35.613 --> 00:33:36.614
Forgive.

00:33:39.183 --> 00:33:40.184
Not forgive.

00:33:42.487 --> 00:33:43.488
Forgive.

00:33:46.724 --> 00:33:47.792
Not forgive.

00:33:52.163 --> 00:33:53.631
Just like them

00:33:55.466 --> 00:33:56.467
I am

00:33:58.202 --> 00:33:59.837
unforgivable.

00:34:02.607 --> 00:34:03.608
Grandpa.

00:34:04.876 --> 00:34:05.877
You know I never

00:34:08.046 --> 00:34:10.748
wanted to be like Mom.

00:34:13.851 --> 00:34:14.886
All these years...

00:34:17.422 --> 00:34:19.590
she destroyed someone's family.

00:34:22.693 --> 00:34:24.462
That's unforgivable.

00:34:29.133 --> 00:34:31.502
So I thought she got punished.

00:34:34.972 --> 00:34:37.642
Unable to marry the man she loved

00:34:40.011 --> 00:34:44.148
she was lonely,
and I felt sorry for her.

00:34:51.022 --> 00:34:52.023
But...

00:34:56.294 --> 00:34:57.328
I guess...

00:35:00.264 --> 00:35:02.266
I'm not so different from her.

00:35:07.371 --> 00:35:08.372
Just like her...

00:35:13.744 --> 00:35:16.214
I couldn't have a happy marriage.

00:35:26.858 --> 00:35:28.459
Me and Mom...

00:35:31.529 --> 00:35:33.030
Did Susumu Tsukishiro

00:35:34.365 --> 00:35:36.434
ruin both our lives?

00:35:39.270 --> 00:35:40.271
What do you think?

00:35:44.876 --> 00:35:46.043
What do you think?

00:35:57.188 --> 00:35:58.189
Grandpa.

00:35:58.956 --> 00:35:59.957
Are you in pain?

00:36:00.658 --> 00:36:03.060
- I'll get the doctor.
- I'm okay.

00:36:03.794 --> 00:36:05.930
- I'm okay.
- Grandpa.

00:36:07.732 --> 00:36:08.733
What is it?

00:36:10.001 --> 00:36:11.002
I'm...

00:36:12.336 --> 00:36:13.538
I'm sorry.

00:36:17.975 --> 00:36:19.010
I want you

00:36:21.345 --> 00:36:22.380
to live your life.

00:36:24.682 --> 00:36:27.818
Your own life.

00:36:38.029 --> 00:36:39.030
Grandpa?

00:36:42.934 --> 00:36:43.935
Grandpa.

00:36:48.406 --> 00:36:49.507
Grandpa.

00:36:51.108 --> 00:36:52.510
Do I

00:36:53.878 --> 00:36:57.081
still have the right
to live my own life?

00:36:59.383 --> 00:37:02.119
The right to be happy?

00:37:04.121 --> 00:37:05.289
Because

00:37:07.225 --> 00:37:09.293
there's no turning back for me.

00:37:12.830 --> 00:37:16.267
I have no choice
but to remain unforgivable.

00:37:57.775 --> 00:38:00.578
You'd better be ready, Yudai.

00:38:01.879 --> 00:38:02.913
Your mom, too.

00:38:04.615 --> 00:38:05.616
And...

00:38:09.220 --> 00:38:12.490
you, who tormented my mom and me.

00:38:14.792 --> 00:38:15.793
I will never

00:38:17.428 --> 00:38:19.130
forgive you.

00:38:27.571 --> 00:38:29.940
Talking about financial matters.

00:38:30.007 --> 00:38:32.243
I'll help you with anything.

00:38:32.310 --> 00:38:34.378
We are family.

00:38:34.445 --> 00:38:36.747
Please end things with my mom.

00:38:37.048 --> 00:38:38.449
I did it!

00:38:38.516 --> 00:38:41.686
You tricked me! You brat!

00:38:41.786 --> 00:38:43.788
