WEBVTT

00:00:05.105 --> 00:00:06.740
He's always been like this.

00:00:11.711 --> 00:00:13.747
The sun's so bright today.

00:00:14.481 --> 00:00:16.049
Wanna play at the park?

00:00:16.116 --> 00:00:17.117
Yeah.

00:00:17.183 --> 00:00:19.085
Then let's go on the swings first.

00:00:20.987 --> 00:00:22.856
What was lunch yesterday?

00:00:24.891 --> 00:00:26.559
Mom, look!

00:00:26.626 --> 00:00:28.461
My, how adorable.

00:00:28.528 --> 00:00:30.797
That's the bear Yasu bought for you.

00:00:30.864 --> 00:00:34.067
He always has an ulterior motive.

00:00:34.567 --> 00:00:39.639
You're so kind for buying her
a present with your allowance.

00:00:39.706 --> 00:00:41.775
What a good kid.

00:00:42.542 --> 00:00:46.413
I'll give you even more
if you do well on your next test.

00:00:46.479 --> 00:00:48.648
Buy something for yourself
next time, okay?

00:00:48.715 --> 00:00:49.716
Okay.

00:00:50.784 --> 00:00:52.619
Now, let's go study.

00:00:59.692 --> 00:01:01.761
He loved feeling superior.

00:01:02.495 --> 00:01:04.898
He was a nasty person
who loved to ridicule.

00:01:04.964 --> 00:01:06.566
Do your best.

00:01:32.492 --> 00:01:33.560
I'm home.

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:38.865
Oh, Maya?

00:01:38.932 --> 00:01:40.467
What are you doing here?

00:01:41.367 --> 00:01:42.469
Wait, Maya.

00:01:51.778 --> 00:01:53.279
That's how I'd describe

00:01:55.582 --> 00:01:56.583
my brother.

00:02:01.221 --> 00:02:02.489
Where's Mitsuhiro?

00:02:12.632 --> 00:02:13.633
I can't believe

00:02:15.602 --> 00:02:18.004
you were in contact with Mitsuhiro.

00:03:39.819 --> 00:03:46.326
PLEASE DIE MY BELOVED

00:03:50.863 --> 00:03:53.433
Who are you?

00:03:53.499 --> 00:03:57.837
Is this Maya?

00:04:00.473 --> 00:04:02.175
Gaming is the only time
I can forget reality

00:04:02.242 --> 00:04:03.643
I know, right?

00:04:06.212 --> 00:04:07.380
How are things?

00:04:07.447 --> 00:04:09.349
Work and family still the same?

00:04:18.925 --> 00:04:20.827
I went to go check things out

00:04:20.893 --> 00:04:22.629
but she hasn't noticed a thing.

00:04:22.695 --> 00:04:26.599
Maya's always been like that

00:04:35.141 --> 00:04:37.710
Where's Mitsuhiro?
You know something, right?

00:04:43.383 --> 00:04:44.884
Why didn't you tell me?

00:04:45.685 --> 00:04:47.820
- I've been worried sick--
- Worried?

00:04:51.858 --> 00:04:55.295
You were worried about Mitsuhiro?

00:04:57.230 --> 00:04:58.331
Isn't that obvious?

00:04:59.766 --> 00:05:03.236
The police said he might've been
caught up in something and--

00:05:03.303 --> 00:05:04.704
Hypocrite.

00:05:05.571 --> 00:05:07.507
You feel better off without him.

00:05:08.741 --> 00:05:11.110
You wished he was gone, right?

00:05:11.177 --> 00:05:14.380
That it'd be best if he just
left his money and disappeared.

00:05:15.281 --> 00:05:17.150
I heard that's what you think.

00:05:18.885 --> 00:05:21.487
- Who told you that?
- Mitsuhiro.

00:05:23.356 --> 00:05:24.390
Mitsuhiro?

00:05:24.457 --> 00:05:26.392
Yeah, that's what he said.

00:05:26.459 --> 00:05:29.162
That you want him dead.

00:05:29.228 --> 00:05:32.231
That you and your friends
always talk about it.

00:05:35.068 --> 00:05:37.170
I know what would make me happy.

00:05:37.937 --> 00:05:41.274
If my husband dies
and leaves me all his money.

00:05:43.009 --> 00:05:44.377
I wonder if he'll die soon.

00:05:44.444 --> 00:05:47.213
It's a terrible thing to say

00:05:47.914 --> 00:05:49.549
but I know how you feel.

00:05:50.316 --> 00:05:51.784
You two are terrifying.

00:05:54.987 --> 00:05:56.522
How did Mitsuhiro

00:05:57.357 --> 00:05:59.258
know about our conversation?

00:06:11.204 --> 00:06:12.372
Why are you laughing?

00:06:14.307 --> 00:06:15.908
What's so funny?

00:06:16.809 --> 00:06:20.213
Mitsuhiro never stopped
talking about you.

00:06:22.615 --> 00:06:24.217
"I don't understand how she feels."

00:06:24.283 --> 00:06:26.719
"How do we get back
to how things were?"

00:06:26.786 --> 00:06:29.822
"How do we become
close again like before?"

00:06:29.889 --> 00:06:31.758
I don't understand Maya

00:06:34.260 --> 00:06:36.129
No, that can't be true.

00:06:36.195 --> 00:06:37.897
So I told him.

00:06:39.132 --> 00:06:40.500
That it's impossible.

00:06:40.566 --> 00:06:43.369
Once Maya decides to hate you

00:06:43.436 --> 00:06:46.372
her feelings will never return.

00:06:47.540 --> 00:06:48.775
You don't know me.

00:06:51.644 --> 00:06:52.712
Yeah, I do.

00:06:53.513 --> 00:06:56.582
I've watched over you
this whole time, since we were kids.

00:06:56.649 --> 00:06:58.418
I know everything about you.

00:06:58.484 --> 00:06:59.752
You watched over me?

00:06:59.819 --> 00:07:02.455
- Stop being creepy.
- I did watch over you.

00:07:03.556 --> 00:07:04.891
I was jealous of you.

00:07:06.893 --> 00:07:08.428
Are you kidding?

00:07:08.494 --> 00:07:09.829
I was the jealous one.

00:07:09.896 --> 00:07:11.497
I was always jealous.

00:07:11.564 --> 00:07:14.801
You were given freedom
as my sister and a woman.

00:07:14.867 --> 00:07:17.136
As their son,
they had expectations of me.

00:07:17.203 --> 00:07:18.204
Stop spouting nonsense!

00:07:18.271 --> 00:07:20.373
You don't notice
other people's feelings!

00:07:20.440 --> 00:07:24.210
You assume you're the hardest worker
and no one has it as bad as you.

00:07:24.277 --> 00:07:28.314
That's why you cast aside
people's kindness so easily.

00:07:43.629 --> 00:07:44.931
Yasu.

00:07:47.467 --> 00:07:48.601
Yasu?

00:07:51.037 --> 00:07:52.572
You blame everyone else

00:07:52.638 --> 00:07:55.041
and never stop resenting them.

00:07:55.107 --> 00:07:57.176
That's just who you are!

00:08:01.447 --> 00:08:03.349
What's wrong, Yasu?

00:08:03.416 --> 00:08:04.951
Yasu, what happened?

00:08:05.017 --> 00:08:06.018
Are you okay?

00:08:06.519 --> 00:08:08.221
Shut up!

00:08:08.287 --> 00:08:10.289
Stop talking to me!

00:08:10.923 --> 00:08:12.492
What's wrong, Yasu?

00:08:12.558 --> 00:08:14.760
Where are you going? Yasu?

00:08:14.827 --> 00:08:15.895
The restroom!

00:08:16.462 --> 00:08:18.998
Yasu!

00:08:37.250 --> 00:08:38.317
Hey.

00:08:39.352 --> 00:08:40.520
What?

00:08:46.826 --> 00:08:48.394
Let's talk about divorce.

00:08:51.130 --> 00:08:52.965
If I pay the settlement

00:08:53.032 --> 00:08:55.535
can you rethink our divorce?

00:08:56.435 --> 00:08:57.436
What?

00:08:58.371 --> 00:08:59.372
Please.

00:09:00.139 --> 00:09:02.108
Rethink our divorce.

00:09:07.813 --> 00:09:09.549
Is it because of Yuna?

00:09:10.950 --> 00:09:12.051
It's for me.

00:09:12.919 --> 00:09:15.821
I don't want to separate from you.

00:09:22.428 --> 00:09:23.729
I'm sorry.

00:09:23.796 --> 00:09:26.032
I'm just being selfish, huh?

00:09:26.098 --> 00:09:27.767
After what I did to you...

00:09:28.668 --> 00:09:29.902
Forget it.

00:09:38.778 --> 00:09:40.012
I'm going to the car dealer.

00:09:42.582 --> 00:09:44.183
Stay safe.

00:10:22.121 --> 00:10:24.657
Don't take it out.
The bag's there for a reason.

00:10:25.257 --> 00:10:26.258
Sorry.

00:10:27.026 --> 00:10:28.928
I've seen this scene before.

00:10:28.995 --> 00:10:30.863
It's like a backroom deal.

00:10:30.930 --> 00:10:33.199
- Take this seriously.
- Okay.

00:10:33.966 --> 00:10:36.102
The dosage depends on the person

00:10:36.168 --> 00:10:38.371
so maybe test it before the day of.

00:10:38.971 --> 00:10:39.972
Okay.

00:10:41.707 --> 00:10:43.609
You look like you're enjoying this.

00:10:44.677 --> 00:10:47.246
I mean, I'll finally be free of him--

00:10:47.313 --> 00:10:50.750
- Don't let him see your excitement.
- Huh?

00:10:50.816 --> 00:10:54.220
You have to butter him up
and make him drop his guard.

00:10:54.920 --> 00:10:59.191
Act like a loving couple
to prove you have no motive.

00:10:59.825 --> 00:11:01.060
When he dies

00:11:01.127 --> 00:11:03.763
no one will see you as a suspect.

00:11:04.797 --> 00:11:05.898
Got it?

00:11:07.266 --> 00:11:08.267
Yes.

00:11:14.907 --> 00:11:15.975
Hey.

00:11:16.475 --> 00:11:18.277
I told you to polish my shoes.

00:11:18.978 --> 00:11:20.079
I'm sorry.

00:11:34.326 --> 00:11:35.795
- Stop.
- No, I'll help.

00:11:35.861 --> 00:11:37.930
- I'm fine.
- You are?

00:11:48.174 --> 00:11:51.544
Hey, why are you carrying so much?
I'm just going shopping.

00:11:52.678 --> 00:11:55.347
You never know what we might need.

00:12:00.352 --> 00:12:01.954
Keep your neck warm, okay?

00:12:02.988 --> 00:12:04.056
Thanks.

00:12:05.558 --> 00:12:06.559
No. Thank you.

00:12:07.927 --> 00:12:09.562
I'm glad you came back.

00:12:10.696 --> 00:12:12.331
We'll be together forever, right?

00:12:13.466 --> 00:12:14.567
Riko?

00:12:25.644 --> 00:12:27.179
- Good evening.
- Good evening.

00:12:27.246 --> 00:12:29.115
Oh, going on a date?

00:12:29.181 --> 00:12:30.449
Just some shopping.

00:12:30.516 --> 00:12:31.917
Have a good time.

00:12:34.286 --> 00:12:36.322
Reminds me of when I was like that.

00:12:45.898 --> 00:12:48.134
What are they doing there?

00:12:48.200 --> 00:12:49.735
Yeah...

00:12:50.302 --> 00:12:54.306
Are these two really involved
with Mr. Komoto's disappearance?

00:12:55.908 --> 00:12:56.909
No clue.

00:12:59.078 --> 00:13:02.715
But I can't stop
thinking about this trio.

00:13:05.217 --> 00:13:07.820
She just looks like
a housewife though.

00:13:07.887 --> 00:13:08.888
RELATIONSHIP CHART

00:13:08.954 --> 00:13:11.123
Housewives can be scary, you know.

00:13:12.458 --> 00:13:15.060
- You mean your wife, Mr. Shimura?
- Shut up.

00:13:15.127 --> 00:13:16.128
No.

00:13:17.396 --> 00:13:19.799
Let's split up and watch them.

00:13:20.533 --> 00:13:21.634
Got it.

00:14:19.024 --> 00:14:20.059
Maya.

00:14:28.634 --> 00:14:29.802
What is this?

00:14:31.470 --> 00:14:32.471
A handshake.

00:14:39.979 --> 00:14:41.547
You blame everyone else

00:14:41.614 --> 00:14:43.949
and never stop resenting them.

00:14:44.016 --> 00:14:45.784
That's just who you are!

00:14:45.851 --> 00:14:49.555
Mitsuhiro never stopped
talking about you.

00:14:50.122 --> 00:14:51.724
"I don't understand how she feels."

00:14:51.790 --> 00:14:54.226
"How do we get back to
how things were?"

00:14:54.293 --> 00:14:57.263
"How do we become
close again like before?"

00:15:01.767 --> 00:15:03.736
It didn't seem that way to me.

00:15:08.240 --> 00:15:09.675
- I'm home.
- My husband.

00:15:10.175 --> 00:15:13.679
He didn't seem worried at all
about repairing our relationship.

00:15:16.181 --> 00:15:18.617
He could've just told me.

00:15:21.687 --> 00:15:22.688
No.

00:15:23.889 --> 00:15:25.257
I was the same.

00:15:28.427 --> 00:15:30.562
I avoided talking to him about it.

00:15:32.364 --> 00:15:34.166
And this is the result.

00:15:37.503 --> 00:15:38.671
I need to find him.

00:15:54.320 --> 00:15:56.689
- It's windy today.
- Kinda chilly.

00:15:58.590 --> 00:16:00.859
- Can we walk a bit more?
- Yeah, of course.

00:16:01.560 --> 00:16:02.561
It feels so nice.

00:16:03.595 --> 00:16:05.264
Perfect for a walk.

00:16:05.998 --> 00:16:07.866
But this path again?

00:16:08.634 --> 00:16:11.103
- It's fine.
- We always use the same path.

00:16:11.770 --> 00:16:13.072
Is it boring now?

00:16:18.811 --> 00:16:21.914
- Nice weather, huh?
- Right?

00:16:22.514 --> 00:16:24.650
- Perfect for a walk.
- Yeah.

00:16:26.352 --> 00:16:28.887
Should we get coffee at Brooks?

00:16:30.089 --> 00:16:33.125
Then we can wander around
the shopping arcade

00:16:33.792 --> 00:16:35.327
visit the bookstore

00:16:35.394 --> 00:16:37.229
go home, and watch a movie, right?

00:16:37.796 --> 00:16:40.232
Wow, are you telepathic?

00:16:40.299 --> 00:16:42.001
No, I can tell.

00:16:42.634 --> 00:16:44.269
It's what we always do.

00:16:44.870 --> 00:16:45.871
Oh, right.

00:16:47.239 --> 00:16:48.240
Is it boring now?

00:16:48.941 --> 00:16:50.275
I wouldn't say that.

00:16:51.043 --> 00:16:52.044
That's a relief.

00:16:52.911 --> 00:16:54.713
I kind of like it.

00:16:55.547 --> 00:16:58.217
Cycling through your usual day-to-day

00:16:58.283 --> 00:17:00.386
is actually something to treasure.

00:17:01.520 --> 00:17:02.621
Don't you agree?

00:17:03.922 --> 00:17:05.357
I get it.

00:17:05.424 --> 00:17:06.558
I think.

00:17:06.625 --> 00:17:07.659
You think?

00:17:08.727 --> 00:17:10.295
- What a relief.
- I get it.

00:17:13.465 --> 00:17:16.535
- We've created our own routine.
- Yeah.

00:17:17.069 --> 00:17:18.070
That routine

00:17:18.904 --> 00:17:20.639
was from over five years ago.

00:17:23.742 --> 00:17:24.743
But...

00:17:29.448 --> 00:17:32.951
BROOKS

00:17:46.932 --> 00:17:48.367
Welcome.

00:17:48.434 --> 00:17:50.869
- Are you alone?
- Yes.

00:17:50.936 --> 00:17:53.505
Would you like
a table or counter seat?

00:17:54.807 --> 00:17:56.909
I'll take a table.

00:17:56.975 --> 00:17:59.011
Okay, right this way.

00:18:25.337 --> 00:18:27.539
Excuse me. Here's your water.

00:18:27.606 --> 00:18:28.607
Thank you.

00:18:28.674 --> 00:18:30.742
Just say when you're ready to order.

00:18:30.809 --> 00:18:31.844
Thank you.

00:18:32.945 --> 00:18:34.179
- Excuse me...
- Yes?

00:18:35.514 --> 00:18:38.050
I'm looking for someone right now.

00:18:39.218 --> 00:18:40.319
Well...

00:18:45.357 --> 00:18:46.959
It's this person.

00:18:47.960 --> 00:18:50.062
Have you seen him here recently?

00:18:52.965 --> 00:18:54.900
No, I don't believe I have.

00:18:56.168 --> 00:18:57.536
I see. Thank you.

00:18:58.036 --> 00:18:59.204
Of course.

00:19:14.953 --> 00:19:16.421
Well...

00:19:16.488 --> 00:19:17.523
Cheers.

00:19:27.833 --> 00:19:31.303
TODAY'S DATE WITH MY HUSBAND

00:19:31.370 --> 00:19:32.804
#LUNCHDATE #MOTHER

00:19:32.871 --> 00:19:33.872
All right.

00:19:35.774 --> 00:19:36.909
This looks good.

00:19:39.645 --> 00:19:40.846
Don't tell anyone.

00:19:48.387 --> 00:19:50.088
Man, we bought a lot, huh?

00:19:51.957 --> 00:19:54.226
Gosh, sorry.

00:19:55.994 --> 00:19:57.596
This is fun.

00:19:57.663 --> 00:19:58.664
Isn't it, Riko?

00:20:03.769 --> 00:20:06.271
By this time next year,
we'll be a family of three.

00:20:07.206 --> 00:20:09.508
They'll be three, five,
and seven in a flash

00:20:09.575 --> 00:20:13.078
start school,
and suddenly become adults.

00:20:13.645 --> 00:20:15.447
Then they'll get married.

00:20:15.514 --> 00:20:16.782
I can just see it.

00:20:17.516 --> 00:20:19.084
I'm so excited.

00:20:20.586 --> 00:20:23.555
But you know, if they get married

00:20:23.622 --> 00:20:25.157
they'll have kids

00:20:25.691 --> 00:20:28.727
and we'll be grandparents then.

00:21:08.000 --> 00:21:09.034
You dropped this.

00:21:10.269 --> 00:21:11.737
Thank you.

00:21:11.803 --> 00:21:13.005
Please be careful.

00:21:15.107 --> 00:21:16.241
Huh?

00:21:25.884 --> 00:21:27.452
Riko, let's go.

00:21:27.519 --> 00:21:28.520
Yeah.

00:22:02.921 --> 00:22:04.489
I'm sorry.

00:22:04.556 --> 00:22:07.259
I'll whip something up right now.

00:22:07.326 --> 00:22:09.094
- Sit.
- Huh?

00:22:11.063 --> 00:22:14.132
We drink together
once a week as a couple, right?

00:22:17.336 --> 00:22:21.640
We used to drink together like this
once a week, as a couple.

00:22:21.707 --> 00:22:24.543
Really? We must've gotten along.

00:22:25.877 --> 00:22:30.615
And I would pour your glass too.

00:22:34.653 --> 00:22:36.455
My glass.

00:22:37.756 --> 00:22:38.924
Yes?

00:22:38.990 --> 00:22:40.525
That's all you have to say?

00:22:40.592 --> 00:22:42.594
You have to pour for me.

00:22:42.661 --> 00:22:46.598
Next time, pour it
before I have to say it. Got it?

00:22:48.900 --> 00:22:51.336
- That was...
- Yeah, just sit.

00:23:09.821 --> 00:23:10.822
Want ice?

00:23:13.792 --> 00:23:14.793
Yes.

00:23:27.939 --> 00:23:31.143
Where else would my husband go?

00:23:33.678 --> 00:23:34.679
Huh?

00:23:36.782 --> 00:23:38.183
We meet again.

00:23:39.384 --> 00:23:42.854
Remember? I thought
you looked like someone I know.

00:23:42.921 --> 00:23:45.657
Yes, it was nice meeting you.

00:23:46.625 --> 00:23:48.560
I'm surprised we're meeting here.

00:23:48.627 --> 00:23:49.661
Strange, isn't it?

00:23:50.495 --> 00:23:51.696
Yes.

00:23:56.435 --> 00:23:58.570
Well then, see you again.

00:23:59.137 --> 00:24:00.138
Okay.

00:24:12.017 --> 00:24:13.885
Somewhere my husband would go.

00:24:19.558 --> 00:24:20.725
All right.

00:24:22.160 --> 00:24:24.129
I'll clean this up later.

00:24:24.196 --> 00:24:25.997
Let's wash up together.

00:24:27.466 --> 00:24:28.633
Huh?

00:24:28.700 --> 00:24:30.802
I don't want you slipping
in the bath.

00:24:31.570 --> 00:24:32.637
So let's go together.

00:24:35.874 --> 00:24:39.311
Sorry, I'm a bit tired.

00:24:39.377 --> 00:24:40.912
I'll go straight to bed.

00:24:41.413 --> 00:24:42.414
- You okay?
- Yeah.

00:24:43.181 --> 00:24:44.616
I just need to lay down.

00:24:45.116 --> 00:24:46.384
Go wash up, Hiroki.

00:24:47.118 --> 00:24:48.386
- I'll be quick.
- It's fine.

00:24:49.454 --> 00:24:50.755
Take your time.

00:24:51.990 --> 00:24:52.991
Really?

00:24:54.359 --> 00:24:55.360
Okay then.

00:24:58.396 --> 00:25:02.434
The dad's usually on bath duty,
so maybe I'll do some image training.

00:25:13.912 --> 00:25:14.946
Ryosuke

00:25:15.013 --> 00:25:16.882
I'm at your house.
I want to see you, Riko

00:25:23.355 --> 00:25:25.690
Ryosuke, you shouldn't be here.

00:25:26.324 --> 00:25:28.627
But I couldn't stay still.

00:25:30.228 --> 00:25:33.331
I was worried
you might break up with me.

00:25:33.398 --> 00:25:34.900
Of course I wouldn't.

00:25:36.902 --> 00:25:38.403
Is it okay to believe that?

00:25:42.941 --> 00:25:43.942
I'm sorry.

00:25:46.545 --> 00:25:48.280
Just be patient a bit longer.

00:25:51.249 --> 00:25:54.686
And then,
the three of us can be together.

00:25:57.055 --> 00:25:58.056
Oh, right.

00:25:58.790 --> 00:26:00.292
I went to the doctor's.

00:26:02.394 --> 00:26:03.895
They said it's healthy.

00:26:07.666 --> 00:26:09.467
It's finally starting to feel real.

00:26:15.440 --> 00:26:16.575
I'm fine with just us.

00:26:18.843 --> 00:26:19.844
Huh?

00:26:20.478 --> 00:26:23.381
I like when it's just the two of us.

00:26:26.184 --> 00:26:27.185
So...

00:26:29.754 --> 00:26:30.922
let's get an abortion.

00:26:37.295 --> 00:26:38.363
Ryosuke?

00:26:47.205 --> 00:26:50.675
Heart rate rising.

00:26:50.742 --> 00:26:53.812
Heart rate has reached
220 beats per minute.

00:26:53.878 --> 00:26:56.247
Heart rate has reached
230 beats per--

00:26:56.314 --> 00:26:58.516
240... 250 beats per minute.

00:26:58.583 --> 00:27:01.019
Please stop exercising immediately.

00:27:01.086 --> 00:27:03.221
Unable to measure heart rate.

00:27:03.288 --> 00:27:06.291
Please stop exercising immediately.

00:27:31.049 --> 00:27:32.250
Here you are.

00:27:32.317 --> 00:27:33.785
This is strong.

00:27:33.852 --> 00:27:35.787
- Sorry, I'll redo it--
- It's fine.

00:27:39.658 --> 00:27:41.793
Why are you trying to get me drunk?

00:27:50.268 --> 00:27:52.704
The dosage depends on the person

00:27:52.771 --> 00:27:54.939
so maybe test it before the day of.

00:27:55.707 --> 00:27:56.708
Okay.

00:28:18.630 --> 00:28:20.031
Say something.

00:28:22.667 --> 00:28:24.035
Where were you?

00:28:25.837 --> 00:28:27.939
Just the library.

00:28:30.842 --> 00:28:33.845
That's perfect for a broke person
with free time.

00:28:37.782 --> 00:28:40.819
Here, have some more.

00:28:41.853 --> 00:28:42.854
Okay.

00:29:09.681 --> 00:29:11.249
What are you doing?

00:29:11.316 --> 00:29:12.684
What do you mean?

00:29:12.751 --> 00:29:14.285
You're my wife, aren't you?

00:29:16.588 --> 00:29:19.424
You don't want to divorce me, right?

00:29:49.788 --> 00:29:51.356
You didn't drug me enough.

00:29:58.897 --> 00:30:00.265
What the hell?

00:30:03.101 --> 00:30:05.003
You need more sex appeal.

00:30:19.984 --> 00:30:22.387
MARUTA

00:30:31.329 --> 00:30:33.932
- Good evening.
- Come on in.

00:30:33.998 --> 00:30:35.466
Please sit here.

00:30:35.533 --> 00:30:37.302
Yes, thank you.

00:30:38.336 --> 00:30:39.604
What would you like to drink?

00:30:40.271 --> 00:30:42.607
I'd like some oolong tea.

00:30:42.674 --> 00:30:44.075
Oolong tea coming right up.

00:30:45.476 --> 00:30:46.578
It's the exact same

00:30:47.445 --> 00:30:48.880
as back then.

00:30:51.015 --> 00:30:53.017
Gosh, what is this?

00:30:54.419 --> 00:30:57.689
- I've never had anything like it.
- Right?

00:30:58.356 --> 00:30:59.357
It's delicious.

00:30:59.424 --> 00:31:01.226
MARUTA

00:31:05.396 --> 00:31:06.397
Here you go.

00:31:11.669 --> 00:31:12.804
It's been a while.

00:31:13.738 --> 00:31:16.574
Oh, you remember me?

00:31:16.641 --> 00:31:17.809
Of course.

00:31:19.077 --> 00:31:21.813
Your restaurant's the same as always.

00:31:22.580 --> 00:31:24.015
Thank you.

00:31:26.184 --> 00:31:27.819
The taste's the same too.

00:31:29.988 --> 00:31:32.223
Want some oden?

00:31:32.290 --> 00:31:36.227
Yes, okay, I'd like some daikon.

00:31:36.928 --> 00:31:38.863
Some konjac.

00:31:38.930 --> 00:31:41.266
- With kelp and thick fried tofu.
- Coming right up.

00:31:42.033 --> 00:31:44.569
Daikon. Konjac.

00:31:44.636 --> 00:31:46.905
Kelp and thick fried tofu. Got it.

00:31:51.209 --> 00:31:52.210
Well...

00:31:53.044 --> 00:31:56.648
Do you remember the guy
I used to come here with?

00:31:58.917 --> 00:32:00.018
I do.

00:32:01.552 --> 00:32:03.621
- Thanks for waiting.
- Thank you.

00:32:08.826 --> 00:32:10.128
Time to eat.

00:32:17.001 --> 00:32:18.336
This is so good.

00:32:19.103 --> 00:32:21.773
The taste really hasn't changed.

00:32:23.541 --> 00:32:25.243
Keeping it the same is impressive.

00:32:26.044 --> 00:32:27.211
You think so?

00:32:30.348 --> 00:32:31.649
This is delicious.

00:32:37.088 --> 00:32:38.189
By chance...

00:32:38.957 --> 00:32:41.993
has he come by here recently?

00:32:46.297 --> 00:32:47.398
He has.

00:32:49.901 --> 00:32:52.170
Really? When?

00:32:53.371 --> 00:32:54.706
About a week ago.

00:32:57.241 --> 00:32:59.911
- A week ago?
- Yes.

00:33:06.851 --> 00:33:07.919
He's alive.

00:33:09.487 --> 00:33:10.521
My husband

00:33:11.322 --> 00:33:12.323
is alive.

00:33:18.796 --> 00:33:20.131
Thank goodness.

00:33:22.000 --> 00:33:23.634
What?

00:33:25.103 --> 00:33:27.405
Did he say anything?

00:33:27.472 --> 00:33:28.906
Like where he's staying?

00:33:29.240 --> 00:33:33.578
No, I didn't hear him mention
anything about that.

00:33:34.512 --> 00:33:36.581
Right, I'm sorry.

00:33:38.983 --> 00:33:39.984
Huh?

00:33:40.585 --> 00:33:42.387
He was talking to someone?

00:33:45.256 --> 00:33:48.760
Yes, he came with a woman.

00:33:51.596 --> 00:33:52.964
I see.

00:33:56.267 --> 00:33:58.703
Do you remember
what they talked about?

00:33:58.770 --> 00:34:00.438
Anything at all.

00:34:01.039 --> 00:34:02.607
I'm not sure.

00:34:03.541 --> 00:34:04.976
Do you remember?

00:34:05.043 --> 00:34:10.715
No, but I do remember
she had a blue purse.

00:34:11.816 --> 00:34:12.950
Blue?

00:34:14.886 --> 00:34:16.220
I see.

00:34:16.921 --> 00:34:18.589
A three-person group.

00:34:19.657 --> 00:34:20.658
Huh?

00:34:21.492 --> 00:34:25.563
Yes, I remember something
about a three-person group.

00:34:31.002 --> 00:34:32.937
Yeah, that's what he said.

00:34:33.004 --> 00:34:35.907
That you want him dead.

00:34:35.973 --> 00:34:38.576
That you and your friends
always talk about it.

00:34:40.378 --> 00:34:41.379
That's right.

00:34:42.280 --> 00:34:45.850
Mitsuhiro knew about a chat
only the three of us had.

00:34:48.753 --> 00:34:50.088
That means...

00:34:51.556 --> 00:34:54.625
he heard about it from one of us.

00:34:58.729 --> 00:35:00.865
Who could it be?

00:35:02.867 --> 00:35:04.869
You're right, it's totally different.

00:35:06.003 --> 00:35:07.271
Right?

00:35:12.877 --> 00:35:14.645
This is so good!

00:35:19.684 --> 00:35:20.685
Yurika?

00:35:21.752 --> 00:35:22.753
I love that face.

00:35:25.123 --> 00:35:26.624
That can't be.

00:35:28.926 --> 00:35:29.927
No...

00:35:31.129 --> 00:35:32.630
Even Mitsuhiro was struggling.

00:35:32.697 --> 00:35:34.499
How would you know that?

00:35:34.565 --> 00:35:36.334
It was all over his face.

00:35:36.400 --> 00:35:39.003
You could tell from his face
he didn't want to go home.

00:35:41.439 --> 00:35:43.441
Mitsuhiro's affair was with...

00:35:59.323 --> 00:36:00.324
Yurika.

00:37:44.061 --> 00:37:45.129
TO MURDER OR NOT

00:37:45.196 --> 00:37:47.031
Something smells off.

00:37:47.698 --> 00:37:48.766
Really?

00:37:50.434 --> 00:37:52.670
Today's pollen levels are crazy.

00:37:53.938 --> 00:37:55.606
My retirement's coming up

00:37:55.673 --> 00:37:57.441
but my senses are still sharp.

00:37:57.508 --> 00:37:59.210
She's just a housewife.

00:37:59.277 --> 00:38:01.612
The legendary razor-sharp detective

00:38:01.679 --> 00:38:03.447
is getting rusty.

00:38:03.514 --> 00:38:05.516
Is one of them the perp?

00:38:05.583 --> 00:38:08.519
No one uses the word "perp" anymore.

00:38:09.120 --> 00:38:11.489
Do we really have to kill him?

00:38:11.555 --> 00:38:15.293
I've always been heartbroken.

00:38:15.359 --> 00:38:18.195
Being a full-time housewife
is impressive.

00:38:18.262 --> 00:38:19.964
I could never do that.

00:38:20.031 --> 00:38:21.499
Want to drink more?

00:38:21.565 --> 00:38:25.403
We'll never be happy
so long as our husbands are alive.

00:38:25.469 --> 00:38:26.637
So gross!

00:38:26.704 --> 00:38:29.340
Hurry up and die!

00:38:29.407 --> 00:38:31.108
Keep tabs on Yurika Sakaki.

00:38:31.175 --> 00:38:33.744
Next week on Please Die My Beloved.

00:38:33.811 --> 00:38:35.546
Concerto of Betrayal.

00:38:35.613 --> 00:38:37.114
Mr. Shimura,
you didn't say that well.

00:38:37.181 --> 00:38:38.749
All right, let's go.

00:38:38.816 --> 00:38:41.919
CONCERTO OF BETRAYAL
