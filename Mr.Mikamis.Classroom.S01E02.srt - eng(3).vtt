WEBVTT

00:00:03.970 --> 00:00:05.071
Ms. Saejima?

00:00:05.672 --> 00:00:07.741
– Ms. Saejima?
– Really?

00:00:09.075 --> 00:00:10.110
Let's show it to everyone
in the classroom.

00:00:10.210 --> 00:00:11.578
Yeah, let's go.

00:00:16.316 --> 00:00:18.818
– It's been half a year.
– What?

00:00:19.719 --> 00:00:20.854
Hey, Ms. Saejima's here.

00:00:23.423 --> 00:00:26.292
Unfit to Teach! Affair Between
English Teachers Exposed!

00:00:57.791 --> 00:01:01.161
Affair Between
Saejima and Tsutsui Exposed!

00:02:10.864 --> 00:02:13.666
Man, this is depressing.

00:02:14.033 --> 00:02:16.002
I wonder if
our homeroom teacher will change.

00:02:16.102 --> 00:02:19.105
Right? I mean, he basically
committed a crime.

00:02:19.205 --> 00:02:22.275
I felt so down,
I couldn't focus on studying.

00:02:22.375 --> 00:02:24.944
Right? Like, give me a break.

00:02:28.014 --> 00:02:29.382
I don't think he'll be replaced.

00:02:29.782 --> 00:02:31.151
What? Why not?

00:02:31.251 --> 00:02:32.986
Come on,
there's no way they didn't know.

00:02:33.119 --> 00:02:35.688
The school accepted him
fully aware of the situation.

00:02:36.089 --> 00:02:38.458
So, the school deliberately
took in a burden?

00:02:38.591 --> 00:02:39.959
What a pain in the ass.

00:02:40.059 --> 00:02:42.228
And as the homeroom teacher
for a senior class?

00:02:42.328 --> 00:02:44.197
That's seriously rough.

00:02:45.331 --> 00:02:48.868
Like, what do they think
our lives are?

00:02:50.803 --> 00:02:53.273
After everything that was said,
that's what you're stuck on?

00:02:54.407 --> 00:02:55.675
What? What do you mean?

00:02:55.842 --> 00:02:58.878
When we were asked
why the one who got dismissed

00:02:59.045 --> 00:03:01.548
was a woman, it's not like
any of us had a response.

00:03:02.415 --> 00:03:05.251
Maybe we should think a little more
about what that actually meant.

00:03:06.452 --> 00:03:08.855
If being a true elite
includes character

00:03:08.955 --> 00:03:10.623
then that guy
is the worst one of all.

00:03:10.723 --> 00:03:12.625
There's no point in taking his bait.

00:03:16.996 --> 00:03:19.332
I never said
I consider myself a true elite.

00:03:19.966 --> 00:03:21.568
You might as well have.

00:03:23.603 --> 00:03:24.604
Fuyuki.

00:03:25.939 --> 00:03:27.473
Why don't we aim for it together?

00:03:33.179 --> 00:03:34.180
All right, let's begin.

00:03:34.247 --> 00:03:35.515
Turn to page 38.

00:03:48.094 --> 00:03:54.100
MR. MIKAMI'S CLASSROOM

00:04:07.947 --> 00:04:09.882
Excuse me, Mr. Mizohata.

00:04:10.450 --> 00:04:11.484
What is it?

00:04:13.386 --> 00:04:17.523
Do you know why
Ms. Saejima was dismissed?

00:04:22.862 --> 00:04:24.764
I heard she resigned on her own.

00:04:25.465 --> 00:04:26.466
That's all I know.

00:04:28.801 --> 00:04:30.970
Mr. Mizohata, could you
come here for a moment?

00:04:31.070 --> 00:04:32.272
What is it?

00:04:32.472 --> 00:04:33.506
It's about Mr. Mikami's incident.

00:04:33.606 --> 00:04:35.208
A parent is on the phone.

00:04:35.875 --> 00:04:36.876
All right.

00:04:36.976 --> 00:04:38.144
I'll take it.

00:04:43.149 --> 00:04:44.884
Hello, thank you for calling.

00:04:45.418 --> 00:04:47.553
This is Koreeda,
the assistant homeroom teacher.

00:04:47.754 --> 00:04:49.489
Yes. That's right.

00:04:49.589 --> 00:04:51.624
How are things on the parents' side?

00:04:51.791 --> 00:04:56.062
Many parents don't have
a favorable opinion towards Kanzaki

00:04:56.162 --> 00:04:58.231
to begin with, so most of
the complaints are directed at him.

00:04:58.331 --> 00:04:59.866
Well, he is our school's ace.

00:04:59.966 --> 00:05:01.634
There's bound to be some jealousy.

00:05:01.734 --> 00:05:03.503
Kanzaki's our ace?

00:05:04.170 --> 00:05:05.171
Are you serious?

00:05:09.008 --> 00:05:10.943
Quite serious.

00:05:11.010 --> 00:05:13.446
Even if he seems like a nuisance now

00:05:13.946 --> 00:05:17.650
he'll bring honor to our school
a few years after graduation.

00:05:18.284 --> 00:05:21.621
No one dislikes a genius
with a rebellious spirit.

00:05:21.721 --> 00:05:23.556
That may be,
but regarding this situation--

00:05:23.656 --> 00:05:25.925
I've had my concerns
for a while, Mr. Mizobata.

00:05:26.025 --> 00:05:27.226
It's "Mizohata."

00:05:27.927 --> 00:05:32.098
You need to adopt
a long-term perspective.

00:05:32.899 --> 00:05:35.501
That's the most important thing
in education.

00:05:37.537 --> 00:05:38.538
Yes, sir.

00:05:38.638 --> 00:05:39.839
We're done here.

00:05:41.274 --> 00:05:42.275
Excuse me.

00:05:42.375 --> 00:05:43.943
Rintoku

00:05:44.043 --> 00:05:46.045
Virtue never dwells in solitude
He who practices it have neighbors

00:05:55.888 --> 00:05:57.623
Good luck with the interview.

00:05:59.592 --> 00:06:00.593
What?

00:06:01.060 --> 00:06:02.895
If you're going, you should go soon.

00:06:05.298 --> 00:06:06.999
I know. I don't need you to tell me.

00:06:53.746 --> 00:06:55.148
Thank you very much.

00:07:07.827 --> 00:07:08.828
Welcome...

00:07:11.164 --> 00:07:14.500
Ms. Saejima, it's been a while.

00:07:15.535 --> 00:07:16.602
Please leave.

00:07:17.437 --> 00:07:18.704
Can we talk?

00:07:20.373 --> 00:07:21.741
I'll wait until your shift ends.

00:07:22.041 --> 00:07:23.476
I work the late shift.

00:07:24.744 --> 00:07:25.812
Then, how about tomorrow?

00:07:28.581 --> 00:07:30.983
Why the hell should I talk to you?

00:07:34.987 --> 00:07:35.988
Did something happen?

00:07:36.189 --> 00:07:37.190
No, sir.

00:07:37.723 --> 00:07:39.459
I'm very sorry I couldn't be of help.

00:07:59.612 --> 00:08:00.613
Hey.

00:08:06.519 --> 00:08:07.520
Wait up.

00:08:09.522 --> 00:08:12.592
Ms. Saejima works at
that convenience store, right?

00:08:15.394 --> 00:08:16.462
You knew?

00:08:17.129 --> 00:08:18.130
Need some help?

00:08:18.764 --> 00:08:19.765
What?

00:08:20.099 --> 00:08:21.434
I can be useful, you know.

00:08:21.534 --> 00:08:23.736
I won a top prize in
the National Mathematics Contest.

00:08:23.836 --> 00:08:25.471
My specialty is programming.

00:08:26.038 --> 00:08:28.140
Isn't that amazing for
a liberal arts student?

00:08:30.576 --> 00:08:33.479
Look, I don't need any help, okay?

00:08:36.115 --> 00:08:37.517
Wait up!

00:08:41.787 --> 00:08:43.389
Just go home already.

00:08:43.656 --> 00:08:44.690
Home is that way.

00:08:45.224 --> 00:08:49.262
Affair Between
Saejima and Tsutsui Exposed!

00:08:55.968 --> 00:08:57.904
Thank You, Ms. Koreeda!

00:08:58.004 --> 00:09:00.373
Mr. Kinpachi in Class 3-B

00:09:00.473 --> 00:09:04.343
Since J plus C equals to 0,
C is equal to one-fourth.

00:09:13.553 --> 00:09:16.022
– Hey, wait a sec...
– I need more time.

00:09:16.122 --> 00:09:21.327
What? I was just about to
give a new study hint.

00:09:21.427 --> 00:09:22.428
A hint?

00:09:22.762 --> 00:09:28.668
Write down
what you learned today on this paper.

00:09:29.936 --> 00:09:31.938
What?
At least give us problems to solve.

00:09:32.038 --> 00:09:34.006
If I do that, it'll be a quiz, right?

00:09:34.340 --> 00:09:36.642
If you really need problems,
come up with your own.

00:09:38.110 --> 00:09:39.946
Please explain
the intent behind this.

00:09:42.014 --> 00:09:44.617
This is what you call
"active recall," right?

00:09:45.985 --> 00:09:47.019
You know about it?

00:09:47.119 --> 00:09:49.221
– Give me a moment.
– Go ahead.

00:09:58.164 --> 00:10:00.866
This was an actual experiment
conducted in the U.S.

00:10:01.100 --> 00:10:03.970
One group studied once,
another group studied twice

00:10:04.070 --> 00:10:06.205
and another kept
reviewing repeatedly.

00:10:06.606 --> 00:10:08.474
Which group do you think
performed the best?

00:10:10.276 --> 00:10:12.011
The group that kept reviewing, right?

00:10:12.211 --> 00:10:16.315
Actually, there was a difference
between studying once and twice.

00:10:16.415 --> 00:10:19.652
But after that, repeating it
didn't make much of a difference.

00:10:19.919 --> 00:10:21.354
Wait, really?

00:10:21.554 --> 00:10:24.190
And then, between those
who made mind maps

00:10:24.256 --> 00:10:26.492
and those who
actively recalled information

00:10:26.759 --> 00:10:32.198
the ones who practiced recalling it
had the best learning outcomes.

00:10:32.632 --> 00:10:34.066
Really?

00:10:35.001 --> 00:10:37.403
That's active recall?

00:10:38.170 --> 00:10:40.239
Active Recall

00:10:40.339 --> 00:10:41.340
Correct.

00:10:41.440 --> 00:10:42.541
So what, Wakui?

00:10:42.608 --> 00:10:44.276
Are you Okami's apprentice now?

00:10:45.745 --> 00:10:46.746
Not really.

00:10:46.946 --> 00:10:49.448
If something is good,
it doesn't matter who suggests it.

00:10:56.122 --> 00:10:57.223
It can be done anywhere

00:10:57.390 --> 00:11:00.760
even while getting jostled
in a packed train.

00:11:02.928 --> 00:11:04.964
That's it for today's lesson.

00:11:05.364 --> 00:11:08.567
Whether you do it or not
is up to you.

00:11:17.009 --> 00:11:19.178
So, differential
and integral calculus...

00:11:19.278 --> 00:11:20.279
Do you remember it?

00:11:40.666 --> 00:11:41.667
you scared me!

00:11:41.767 --> 00:11:44.704
Hey, I need to talk to you.
Come with me.

00:11:44.804 --> 00:11:46.539
– What?
– Just come with me.

00:11:47.273 --> 00:11:49.675
– What is it?
– It's about yesterday.

00:11:49.775 --> 00:11:51.477
I'll do some
independent digging, too.

00:11:51.577 --> 00:11:54.513
How about we report back
if anything notable comes up?

00:11:54.647 --> 00:11:56.749
Kanzaki, where were you yesterday?

00:11:58.718 --> 00:12:02.354
You're bothered by
what Okami said, aren't you?

00:12:05.391 --> 00:12:06.459
Shut up.

00:12:08.394 --> 00:12:09.695
Wait!

00:12:09.795 --> 00:12:10.963
So...

00:12:25.911 --> 00:12:27.813
– Goodbye.
– See you later.

00:12:35.621 --> 00:12:38.224
Mr. Mikami, do you have a moment?

00:12:38.457 --> 00:12:39.458
What is it?

00:12:40.626 --> 00:12:44.630
Well, it's about Kanzaki.

00:12:45.898 --> 00:12:49.135
– I think he needs some support.
– Support?

00:12:49.468 --> 00:12:51.070
It's a crucial time for him.

00:12:51.137 --> 00:12:53.072
It seems like he feels concerned.

00:12:55.141 --> 00:12:59.512
Crucial time? Because of the exams?

00:13:00.346 --> 00:13:01.947
Isn't that a strange way of thinking?

00:13:02.148 --> 00:13:03.149
What do you mean?

00:13:03.215 --> 00:13:06.051
There's never a time in life
that isn't important.

00:13:09.622 --> 00:13:11.090
Let me tell you a story.

00:13:12.291 --> 00:13:15.628
Every time a new season of
a certain famous school drama airs

00:13:15.728 --> 00:13:16.862
schools all over Japan
fall into chaos

00:13:16.962 --> 00:13:18.597
leading to classroom breakdowns.

00:13:19.098 --> 00:13:21.133
Wait, do you mean that drama?

00:13:21.233 --> 00:13:24.870
Yes, that one.
The one you probably liked too.

00:13:27.506 --> 00:13:30.876
What does that mean?

00:13:30.976 --> 00:13:34.079
It created an atmosphere where
only super passionate teachers

00:13:34.180 --> 00:13:37.683
who dedicate themselves to students
are considered real educators.

00:13:39.051 --> 00:13:41.320
Parents' demands
towards the teachers escalated.

00:13:41.420 --> 00:13:43.088
So ironically

00:13:43.189 --> 00:13:45.224
the school drama that portrayed
the ideal vision of education

00:13:45.324 --> 00:13:47.126
wound up becoming
a monster parent factory.

00:13:47.359 --> 00:13:49.962
I never intended to be
a super passionate teacher...

00:13:50.095 --> 00:13:52.498
I admit, I did aspire to
be like that for a while.

00:13:54.533 --> 00:13:58.270
For over 40 years,
that TV drama series

00:13:58.370 --> 00:14:00.206
has dictated the image of
a "good teacher."

00:14:00.973 --> 00:14:02.675
Think about it.

00:14:03.042 --> 00:14:05.945
There are about 250,000
high school teachers nationwide.

00:14:06.445 --> 00:14:09.815
Should all of them
become super passionate teachers

00:14:10.049 --> 00:14:12.551
or should we rethink
the concept of a "good teacher"?

00:14:13.285 --> 00:14:15.221
Which do you think is more realistic?

00:14:22.928 --> 00:14:26.098
I've never thought about it that way.

00:14:27.099 --> 00:14:31.403
School and bureaucracies are
shockingly bound by precedents.

00:14:32.438 --> 00:14:36.075
Education reform cannot
be achieved that way.

00:14:37.109 --> 00:14:40.880
What education needs now
is not an upgrade, but a rebuild.

00:14:41.647 --> 00:14:44.783
We must fundamentally rethink

00:14:45.451 --> 00:14:47.553
and reconstruct
existing systems and processes.

00:14:50.189 --> 00:14:55.961
That said, it's true that this moment
is significant for Kanzaki.

00:14:56.528 --> 00:14:57.529
What?

00:14:57.630 --> 00:15:00.199
It's only a matter of time
before the media catches on to

00:15:00.299 --> 00:15:02.968
the connection between
that murder case and Rintoku.

00:15:06.272 --> 00:15:10.709
We need to decide when to step in...

00:15:12.511 --> 00:15:14.480
or whether to step in at all.

00:15:16.315 --> 00:15:17.650
That's a difficult question.

00:15:20.619 --> 00:15:21.754
Let's think about it.

00:15:31.397 --> 00:15:32.398

00:15:40.072 --> 00:15:41.073
I'm home.

00:15:41.707 --> 00:15:44.109
Hi, Takuto. Did you eat?

00:15:45.744 --> 00:15:46.745
Yeah, I ate already.

Tokyo University English Prep Course
Instructor: Tsutsui Kosuke

00:16:04.096 --> 00:16:05.264
Hello, everyone.

00:16:05.497 --> 00:16:07.900
I'm Tsutsui from Tokyo University
prep course's English department.

00:16:08.233 --> 00:16:12.972
All right, let's get started
with page 23 of the textbook.

00:16:13.138 --> 00:16:16.742
We'll begin by
explaining question one.

00:16:17.376 --> 00:16:20.679
Why was it the female teacher
who quit and not the male teacher?

00:16:20.813 --> 00:16:23.048
You can solve the problem
without doing that.

00:16:23.482 --> 00:16:26.151
Don't forget this.

00:16:26.251 --> 00:16:30.155
Now, let's move on to question two.

00:16:30.856 --> 00:16:34.760
Rearrange the given words
in the correct order...

00:16:38.664 --> 00:16:41.700
I heard Mr. Mikami is
doing whatever he wants over there.

00:16:41.800 --> 00:16:43.736
Really? Where did you hear that?

00:16:43.936 --> 00:16:45.738
My colleague's sister is in Rintoku.

00:16:45.971 --> 00:16:48.107
What a small world.

00:16:48.407 --> 00:16:49.875
You haven't been in touch?

00:16:49.975 --> 00:16:51.243
You saw what happened.

00:16:51.510 --> 00:16:53.479
You got your position
by selling me out, right?

00:16:53.879 --> 00:16:55.147
So I should congratulate you.

00:16:57.116 --> 00:16:58.217
I'm worried.

00:16:58.283 --> 00:16:59.952
I'm actually
quite fond of Mr. Mikami.

00:17:00.085 --> 00:17:01.587
Really? In what way?

00:17:03.022 --> 00:17:06.625
He seems cold at first,
but he's actually kind.

00:17:08.060 --> 00:17:12.865
Two Years Ago

00:17:32.618 --> 00:17:33.619
Hey.

00:17:40.993 --> 00:17:41.994
Let me do that.

00:17:42.628 --> 00:17:45.330
I can't.
I have a Diet session tomorrow.

00:17:45.431 --> 00:17:47.399
You missed the last train again
last night, didn't you?

00:17:47.533 --> 00:17:49.301
Aren't you due soon?
This is ridiculous.

00:17:50.636 --> 00:17:52.504
But if something happens...

00:17:52.704 --> 00:17:55.340
It's fine. Just go home.

00:17:56.008 --> 00:17:58.844
Can you give me
just ten minutes for a briefing?

00:18:01.380 --> 00:18:02.381
Sure.

00:18:05.417 --> 00:18:07.086
That's so unfair.

00:18:07.186 --> 00:18:09.922
He pulls out the gentleman act
at just the right moment.

00:18:10.322 --> 00:18:12.791
That's how he gets
everyone to fall for him.

00:18:14.093 --> 00:18:15.894
Right, that reminds me.

00:18:18.130 --> 00:18:19.131
What's this?

00:18:19.465 --> 00:18:20.799
You get to supervise

00:18:20.866 --> 00:18:22.734
Representative Hasebe's
grandson's homework.

00:18:23.702 --> 00:18:26.905
Seriously?
No, really, are you serious?

00:18:27.406 --> 00:18:29.741
From Diet sessions
to a grandson's homework...

00:18:30.075 --> 00:18:33.245
Anything related to education and
culture falls under our jurisdiction.

00:18:33.312 --> 00:18:34.880
That's the Ministry of Education
for you.

00:18:34.947 --> 00:18:36.915
Give me a break.

00:18:38.083 --> 00:18:41.220
All right, one more task to go.

00:18:41.553 --> 00:18:44.490
Man, I can't believe
we're saying that at this hour.

00:18:53.365 --> 00:18:55.400
Let's confirm this once more.

00:18:56.768 --> 00:19:00.439
So, we can state that these claims
are completely unfounded, right?

00:19:00.906 --> 00:19:03.308
Yes, as far as I can remember.

00:19:03.642 --> 00:19:06.145
What's with that snarky phrasing?

00:19:06.545 --> 00:19:09.081
Regardless, having an article
like this written about you

00:19:09.181 --> 00:19:11.817
so soon after arriving
shows how careless you are.

00:19:11.950 --> 00:19:15.954
Yes, I admit that was
a lapse in my judgment.

00:19:18.757 --> 00:19:20.659
You sound like a bureaucrat.

00:19:20.893 --> 00:19:24.363
Did I slip into
"Kasumigaseki Literature" again?

00:19:24.463 --> 00:19:26.632
– What?
– Yes, it's a thing.

00:19:26.832 --> 00:19:32.671
For example, "I do not recall,
so I have nothing further to say."

00:19:32.771 --> 00:19:34.806
This isn't Kasumigaseki.

00:19:34.907 --> 00:19:36.475
But it's convenient. Very flexible.

00:19:36.542 --> 00:19:38.110
It can be interpreted in many ways.

00:19:38.210 --> 00:19:39.645
It's the one and only literature

00:19:39.745 --> 00:19:41.747
crafted by bureaucrats,
for bureaucrats.

00:19:43.048 --> 00:19:44.850
I'll keep improving my skills.

00:19:52.491 --> 00:19:54.126
Good work today.

00:19:54.259 --> 00:19:55.761
Thank you very much.

00:19:55.961 --> 00:19:56.962
See you tomorrow.

The Dark Secrets of
Suspect Mayama Yuzuru

00:21:06.732 --> 00:21:08.533
I told you I have nothing to say.

00:21:09.534 --> 00:21:11.236
I have something I need to ask.

00:21:11.870 --> 00:21:15.140
I don't want to answer.
You understand that, right?

00:21:18.310 --> 00:21:22.281
Please, just let me talk.

00:21:24.483 --> 00:21:25.484
Please.

00:21:30.822 --> 00:21:31.990
Not here.

00:21:32.758 --> 00:21:35.827
Follow me, but keep your distance.

00:22:43.528 --> 00:22:44.529
Let's talk here.

00:22:47.399 --> 00:22:50.268
Are you here to talk about her?

00:22:52.137 --> 00:22:53.138
What?

00:22:54.940 --> 00:22:55.974
You don't know?

00:22:57.576 --> 00:22:58.744
About what?

00:23:01.313 --> 00:23:03.482
Then, why are you here?

00:23:06.651 --> 00:23:08.220
It's because of my article, isn't it?

00:23:11.590 --> 00:23:15.594
It's true that your article
in Rintoku Newspaper changed my life.

00:23:16.728 --> 00:23:19.531
I got divorced, and I quit my job.

00:23:21.233 --> 00:23:24.069
But all you did was
add the final drop

00:23:24.136 --> 00:23:26.271
to an already overflowing cup.

00:23:27.372 --> 00:23:29.274
I can't have you feeling responsible.

00:23:30.308 --> 00:23:32.077
Aren't you saying that
just to protect me?

00:23:32.177 --> 00:23:33.845
– No.
– That's a lie.

00:23:33.945 --> 00:23:35.046
Don't assume things.

00:23:37.215 --> 00:23:38.216
But...

00:23:38.316 --> 00:23:40.018
That's all I can say.

00:23:40.685 --> 00:23:42.421
And that's all I want to say.

00:23:45.891 --> 00:23:47.426
That's not enough for me.

00:23:47.526 --> 00:23:50.695
I don't live to
satisfy your curiosity.

00:23:58.303 --> 00:24:03.141
No matter what happens from now on,
it's not your fault.

00:24:05.944 --> 00:24:07.879
You mustn't come here again.

You were following me?

00:25:21.119 --> 00:25:24.756
I knew Ms. Saejima was working there.

00:25:27.559 --> 00:25:32.430
But don't worry.
I didn't hear your conversation.

00:25:41.706 --> 00:25:42.941
I'm responsible too.

00:25:49.714 --> 00:25:50.715
What?

00:25:55.487 --> 00:25:56.821
Let me think about it with you.

00:27:13.465 --> 00:27:16.067
– Please stop taking pictures.
– Can we get a comment?

00:27:16.201 --> 00:27:17.202
Excuse me!

00:27:18.803 --> 00:27:19.804
Excuse me!

00:27:20.805 --> 00:27:21.906
Excuse me!

00:27:22.007 --> 00:27:23.008
Excuse me!

00:27:23.108 --> 00:27:24.909
I'm very sorry.

00:27:25.010 --> 00:27:26.511
Kindly refrain from interviewing.

00:27:26.678 --> 00:27:29.114
Ms. Saejima Yuko is
a former Rintoku Academy teacher

00:27:29.214 --> 00:27:31.116
and the mother of Mayama Yuzuru

00:27:31.216 --> 00:27:33.752
the suspect in the civil service exam
murder case, correct?

00:27:34.185 --> 00:27:36.254
Please direct all inquiries
to the school's PR office.

00:27:36.354 --> 00:27:39.491
And please refrain from
directly interviewing students.

00:27:39.591 --> 00:27:43.328
Is it true she resigned because
a student exposed her affair?

00:27:44.229 --> 00:27:46.564
Wasn't that the real reason
behind the case?

00:27:55.440 --> 00:27:58.209
Please stop the interviews.
We ask you to leave for today.

00:27:58.777 --> 00:28:01.813
– PR representative...
– Please leave. Please...

00:28:01.913 --> 00:28:03.615
Give us a proper statement!

00:28:06.651 --> 00:28:08.620
– What happened?
– I'll explain later.

00:28:08.720 --> 00:28:10.588
Make sure the students
don't talk to them.

00:28:10.689 --> 00:28:11.690
Yes.

00:28:11.790 --> 00:28:14.526
Please refrain from
interviewing students.

00:28:14.826 --> 00:28:16.428
Stop the interviews.

00:28:17.629 --> 00:28:19.397
Go to your classrooms.

00:28:35.113 --> 00:28:36.114
Good morning.

00:29:00.705 --> 00:29:02.674
Do you know anything about this?

00:29:02.774 --> 00:29:03.875
No, I don't.

00:29:04.042 --> 00:29:05.043
Good morning.

00:29:09.914 --> 00:29:14.686
I figured the thing about Ms. Saejima
would come out sooner or later.

00:29:14.986 --> 00:29:21.493
But, how did the media find out about
the newspaper article Kanzaki wrote?

00:29:22.160 --> 00:29:24.262
I sincerely apologize.

00:29:26.064 --> 00:29:27.065
Yes?

00:29:27.365 --> 00:29:28.366
Chairman.

00:29:28.800 --> 00:29:31.803
What will you do about
tonight's TV appearance?

00:29:31.903 --> 00:29:34.906
At a time like this? Cancel it.

00:29:35.173 --> 00:29:37.208
That would be the best decision,
right, Chairman?

00:29:37.342 --> 00:29:38.343
No.

00:29:40.712 --> 00:29:42.480
– Stick to the original plan.
– What?

00:29:42.914 --> 00:29:45.984
It would be strange to cancel
if we have nothing to hide.

00:29:46.551 --> 00:29:47.719
As expected.

00:29:48.253 --> 00:29:51.022
I'll inform the station that
we'll proceed as planned.

00:30:04.135 --> 00:30:06.571
Are you going to explain this
to the students now?

00:30:06.871 --> 00:30:08.740
Yes, I suppose so.

00:30:10.275 --> 00:30:13.978
Will you just tell them, "We're not
at liberty to disclose more"?

00:30:14.412 --> 00:30:15.413
Yes.

00:30:15.513 --> 00:30:17.615
Shall I go with Nagatacho-style
statements this time?

00:30:17.882 --> 00:30:21.820
– What?
– "It is truly regrettable."

00:30:23.788 --> 00:30:25.190
Now, if you'll excuse me.

00:30:32.397 --> 00:30:35.767
Is it true?
Their last names are different.

00:30:36.067 --> 00:30:38.169
It seems she used
her maiden name for work.

00:30:38.536 --> 00:30:39.604
I see.

00:30:41.005 --> 00:30:42.607
It's already published
on online news.

00:30:43.875 --> 00:30:46.511
They don't even bother
verifying things before publishing.

00:30:49.581 --> 00:30:51.616
– Good morning.
– Good morning.

00:30:59.290 --> 00:31:01.759
We will explain the commotion
at the school gate.

00:31:02.227 --> 00:31:04.229
This involves events that happened
before I was assigned here

00:31:04.329 --> 00:31:06.497
so Ms. Koreeda is also present.

00:31:07.532 --> 00:31:10.568
– Would you mind explaining?
– Okay.

00:31:11.603 --> 00:31:15.807
Recently, there was a murder
at a civil service exam site.

00:31:16.708 --> 00:31:19.377
The suspect arrested at the scene
is the child of Ms. Saejima

00:31:19.844 --> 00:31:22.614
who resigned from Rintoku last year.

00:31:24.983 --> 00:31:27.986
The school is
firmly refusing any interviews

00:31:28.086 --> 00:31:30.955
but reporters may
continue coming for a while.

00:31:31.723 --> 00:31:34.926
Please remain calm
and handle the situation carefully.

00:31:36.027 --> 00:31:38.196
If they follow you
or come to your house

00:31:38.296 --> 00:31:39.931
contact the school immediately.

00:31:40.031 --> 00:31:41.466
May I ask something?

00:31:42.533 --> 00:31:43.534
Go ahead.

00:31:43.635 --> 00:31:47.372
What you mentioned
applies to regular classes.

00:31:48.072 --> 00:31:49.073
Well...

00:31:50.475 --> 00:31:53.044
Our class has been together
since our junior year.

00:31:53.278 --> 00:31:56.581
We're the same group as when
Kanzaki published his article.

00:31:57.782 --> 00:32:02.687
Assuming that Kanzaki's article
indirectly led to the murder

00:32:03.655 --> 00:32:06.324
being careful isn't enough.

00:32:07.025 --> 00:32:09.460
Wouldn't it be better for
the whole class to discuss it?

00:32:13.998 --> 00:32:17.368
– You have a point. Shall we?
– What?

00:32:17.468 --> 00:32:19.637
– Excuse me.
– Yes?

00:32:20.204 --> 00:32:21.406
It's really bothering me that

00:32:21.506 --> 00:32:24.375
I haven't been able to focus on
studying since the new term started.

00:32:24.909 --> 00:32:25.910
That's all.

00:32:26.377 --> 00:32:28.680
Sakurai, that was a bit harsh.

00:32:28.780 --> 00:32:31.649
Was it? It's the truth.

00:32:32.383 --> 00:32:34.619
Ignoring it only made
the problem worse.

00:32:35.053 --> 00:32:38.356
If we ignore it again, won't it
just get even harder to focus?

00:32:40.358 --> 00:32:42.794
Do you even have
the right to say that?

00:32:43.661 --> 00:32:45.697
Sakurai, you want to
become a lawyer, right?

00:32:46.297 --> 00:32:47.298
What?

00:32:47.365 --> 00:32:50.635
Would you say in court,
"You're a criminal, so shut up"?

00:32:53.237 --> 00:32:57.075
And as far as I know,
all the professions you're aiming for

00:32:57.175 --> 00:33:00.611
require focus
no matter the situation.

00:33:10.788 --> 00:33:11.789
All right, let's start.

00:33:18.830 --> 00:33:20.331
Guys...

00:33:20.898 --> 00:33:25.036
How did you actually feel
about that news article at the time?

00:33:31.342 --> 00:33:35.313
Honestly, I found it
kind of satisfying.

00:33:36.581 --> 00:33:39.050
I thought it was outrageous
for teachers to have an affair.

00:33:39.584 --> 00:33:44.255
To be honest, I also thought,
"Good job, Kanzaki."

00:33:46.157 --> 00:33:50.028
So, I don't think this incident
is entirely Kanzaki's fault.

00:33:51.329 --> 00:33:53.664
I see. Anyone else?

00:33:56.067 --> 00:34:00.705
I couldn't believe Ms. Saejima
would do something like that.

00:34:02.206 --> 00:34:03.408
It made me uneasy.

00:34:09.647 --> 00:34:10.782
Go ahead.

00:34:11.849 --> 00:34:16.921
I thought it was like those
citizen-arrest YouTubers.

00:34:17.755 --> 00:34:18.923
I can see that.

00:34:19.357 --> 00:34:21.526
Wait, citizen arrest?

00:34:22.660 --> 00:34:24.095
There's a law that allows

00:34:24.295 --> 00:34:27.231
regular people to make arrests
if they catch someone in the act.

00:34:27.865 --> 00:34:31.035
But, some people do it
just to post videos online.

00:34:32.503 --> 00:34:37.708
The way Ms. Saejima was judged
one-sidedly reminded me of that.

00:34:38.342 --> 00:34:44.315
But, aren't you afraid the discussion
we're having now is the same thing?

00:34:45.016 --> 00:34:46.017
That's...

00:34:47.185 --> 00:34:49.854
Yeah, I get what you mean.

00:34:50.254 --> 00:34:52.256
I mean, we're having this
discussion with Kanzaki here.

00:34:52.390 --> 00:34:54.826
So, would it be better to
talk about it without him?

00:34:59.363 --> 00:35:01.099
That would be even worse.

00:35:04.302 --> 00:35:05.970
Kanzaki, what do you think?

00:35:11.442 --> 00:35:16.013
No matter what happens
from now on, it's not your fault.

00:35:19.750 --> 00:35:20.751
Nothing.

00:35:26.190 --> 00:35:29.494
Do you really mean that? "Nothing"?

00:35:31.629 --> 00:35:32.763
You don't, do you?

00:35:36.834 --> 00:35:38.102
If it were me,

00:35:38.736 --> 00:35:40.872
I wouldn't know what to say
in a moment like this.

00:35:47.311 --> 00:35:48.412
Can I say something?

00:35:54.719 --> 00:35:57.088
This photo is called
"The Vulture and the Little Girl."

00:35:57.188 --> 00:35:59.190
It's famous for being one of

00:35:59.290 --> 00:36:01.626
the ultimate ethical dilemmas
in journalism.

00:36:02.593 --> 00:36:04.395
It was taken in Sudan

00:36:04.495 --> 00:36:06.664
a country suffering from
poverty after a long civil war.

00:36:07.498 --> 00:36:12.870
The photo won a major award,
but it also faced intense criticism.

00:36:14.405 --> 00:36:15.773
People asked...

00:36:16.607 --> 00:36:20.578
"Shouldn't the photographer help
the child before taking the picture?"

00:36:23.347 --> 00:36:25.750
Do you know
what happened afterward?

00:36:28.553 --> 00:36:34.859
The child was later taken to
a food center and survived.

00:36:36.961 --> 00:36:39.297
But the photographer,
who was criticized relentlessly

00:36:39.897 --> 00:36:42.600
fell into depression
and took his own life.

00:36:44.502 --> 00:36:45.570
I'm impressed.

00:36:46.404 --> 00:36:49.273
I grew up in a house where that photo
was hanging in the living room.

00:36:50.608 --> 00:36:52.076
Would you have taken the picture?

00:36:52.443 --> 00:36:53.444
I would.

00:36:54.178 --> 00:36:55.246
No hesitation.

00:36:56.881 --> 00:36:57.882
I...

00:36:59.717 --> 00:37:01.552
I wouldn't die over
something like that.

00:37:04.522 --> 00:37:06.490
You shouldn't overestimate yourself.

00:37:12.296 --> 00:37:13.864
Takashi,
something awful has happened!

00:37:26.377 --> 00:37:27.912
Now, I asked all of you this before.

00:37:29.981 --> 00:37:31.549
"Why was it the female teacher
who was forced to resign

00:37:31.649 --> 00:37:33.684
and not the male teacher?"

00:37:35.453 --> 00:37:37.121
– Ms. Koreeda.
– Yes?

00:37:37.221 --> 00:37:39.090
When the current seniors were juniors

00:37:39.190 --> 00:37:42.093
you were the only
female homeroom teacher, right?

00:37:43.527 --> 00:37:44.662
That's correct.

00:37:45.663 --> 00:37:48.132
Don't you think that's why
you were replaced by me?

00:37:51.202 --> 00:37:52.236
I do.

00:37:52.970 --> 00:37:57.041
If they needed a sacrificial lamb,
they'd naturally pick the weaker one.

00:38:00.011 --> 00:38:01.512
That's going too far.

00:38:01.946 --> 00:38:04.448
So, can you say for sure that
the ones who made the decision

00:38:04.515 --> 00:38:05.850
had no such bias?

00:38:10.688 --> 00:38:13.858
And wasn't it
the same for Ms. Saejima?

00:38:27.071 --> 00:38:29.240
If Kevin Carter
hadn't taken that photo

00:38:30.308 --> 00:38:32.677
no one would have known about
the poverty going on there.

00:38:33.611 --> 00:38:35.813
That's why I believe sometimes
you have to press the shutter.

00:38:43.421 --> 00:38:44.422
But back then...

00:38:47.191 --> 00:38:48.426
I didn't try to see

00:38:51.829 --> 00:38:55.266
the true identity of the vulture

00:38:58.436 --> 00:38:59.770
attacking Ms. Saejima.

00:39:07.078 --> 00:39:12.116
So from now on...

00:39:18.889 --> 00:39:20.758
I will catch it no matter what.

00:39:33.137 --> 00:39:34.305
That'll be good.

00:39:37.708 --> 00:39:38.776
See?

00:39:40.277 --> 00:39:41.846
It wasn't "nothing" after all.

00:39:50.388 --> 00:39:51.389
Thank you.

00:39:57.962 --> 00:40:00.998
That was a really
meaningful discussion.

00:40:18.215 --> 00:40:20.284
That took a while.

00:40:20.518 --> 00:40:22.353
But it turned into a good discussion.

00:40:23.387 --> 00:40:24.388
What?

00:40:25.756 --> 00:40:27.725
He said
he's going to catch the vulture.

00:40:28.225 --> 00:40:30.594
– What? A vulture?
– Yes.

00:40:31.128 --> 00:40:35.533
Animals that feed on rotting flesh
are called scavengers.

00:40:36.600 --> 00:40:40.070
If dead animals are left alone,
diseases can spread.

00:40:40.337 --> 00:40:44.442
Scavengers help prevent that.

00:40:45.242 --> 00:40:49.513
But sometimes, they also
erase evidence of slaughter.

00:41:00.858 --> 00:41:02.126
That's it for today's lesson.

00:41:20.411 --> 00:41:22.213
– Hey, Tominaga.
– What?

00:41:22.580 --> 00:41:24.248
There's something
I want to talk about.

00:41:24.448 --> 00:41:25.716
Can you spare some time?

00:41:25.816 --> 00:41:26.817
Of course.

00:41:27.451 --> 00:41:28.452
Sorry.

00:41:28.552 --> 00:41:30.321
I actually love it when someone says

00:41:30.421 --> 00:41:31.655
"I have something
I want to talk about."

00:41:31.755 --> 00:41:32.823
So I'm happy to listen.

00:41:39.263 --> 00:41:40.331
What's up?

00:41:42.032 --> 00:41:43.234
I came for this.

00:41:43.300 --> 00:41:44.802
Though it pains me to admit it.

00:41:46.136 --> 00:41:50.574
People like you who hate to lose
are exactly who I target my sales at.

00:42:00.217 --> 00:42:03.454
I tried to ignore it.

00:42:04.822 --> 00:42:06.357
Ignore what?

00:42:07.691 --> 00:42:10.394
My responsibility as
their homeroom teacher.

00:42:11.428 --> 00:42:12.496
Chairman Kodai is here.

00:42:13.898 --> 00:42:14.899
Excuse me.

00:42:14.999 --> 00:42:16.800
Kanzaki's news article...

00:42:18.002 --> 00:42:20.371
We let it slide under the excuse that

00:42:20.971 --> 00:42:22.907
students have the right to do so.

00:42:23.908 --> 00:42:26.710
Because of that,
Ms. Saejima was forced to resign.

00:42:30.114 --> 00:42:31.749
And when that incident happened

00:42:32.750 --> 00:42:35.619
I was only worried about
how Kanzaki was feeling.

00:42:36.854 --> 00:42:39.723
An innocent person
had lost their life,

00:42:41.225 --> 00:42:43.928
but I didn't think
I bore any responsibility at all.

00:42:48.999 --> 00:42:54.939
But, Koreeda.
You're taking action now, right?

00:42:59.510 --> 00:43:02.513
Yeah, but this isn't enough.

00:43:03.447 --> 00:43:06.450
The students were the ones
who started today's discussion.

00:43:06.750 --> 00:43:08.519
Even if it isn't enough,
you can't just give up, right?

00:43:08.619 --> 00:43:10.521
Both you and me.

00:43:11.288 --> 00:43:13.023
What? You?

00:43:17.461 --> 00:43:19.730
I always feel powerless.

00:43:20.698 --> 00:43:23.367
There's only so much
a school nurse can do.

00:43:33.677 --> 00:43:38.382
I guess I had no right to get upset
when he called me a slow loris.

00:43:38.482 --> 00:43:39.483
What?

00:43:39.950 --> 00:43:43.220
You mean that cute little monkey?

00:43:46.390 --> 00:43:50.160
When you teach at
such a prestigious school

00:43:50.961 --> 00:43:54.999
it's easy to start believing
you're an exceptional teacher.

00:43:57.234 --> 00:43:58.502
But in reality

00:43:59.303 --> 00:44:02.940
I have no poison or any real weapons.

00:44:05.943 --> 00:44:06.944
In that case...

00:44:09.680 --> 00:44:13.183
I just have to change myself
as much as I can.

00:44:16.787 --> 00:44:17.788
I agree.

00:44:23.260 --> 00:44:24.261
Let's do our best.

00:44:29.533 --> 00:44:32.770
– I'll make some tea.
– Thank you.

00:44:34.038 --> 00:44:38.242
We'll be discussing the secret to
Rintoku Academy's success today.

00:44:38.342 --> 00:44:39.643
Before we do that

00:44:39.710 --> 00:44:42.646
may I talk about the connection
between the recent murder

00:44:42.946 --> 00:44:47.017
at the civil service exam site
and Rintoku Academy?

00:44:48.986 --> 00:44:51.422
If you don't mind, please go ahead.

00:44:51.522 --> 00:44:54.558
Our school is not directly involved.

00:44:55.526 --> 00:44:59.263
However, since the suspect's mother
was a former teacher at Rintoku

00:44:59.363 --> 00:45:01.465
I was personally shocked.

00:45:01.565 --> 00:45:02.866
That being said

00:45:03.534 --> 00:45:05.436
I feel strong resentment
toward the media

00:45:05.769 --> 00:45:07.604
for maliciously reporting that

00:45:07.705 --> 00:45:12.342
she resigned because of
a student's news article.

00:45:13.277 --> 00:45:19.049
We recognize it as a legitimate act
protected by freedom of speech.

00:45:19.683 --> 00:45:21.819
Criticizing it could become
a human rights issue.

00:45:22.820 --> 00:45:25.389
Will there be any disciplinary action
against the student?

00:45:25.589 --> 00:45:27.491
We have never even considered it.

00:45:28.759 --> 00:45:33.297
If anything, this proves that
the suspect's home environment

00:45:33.397 --> 00:45:35.599
was far from ideal.

00:45:36.333 --> 00:45:39.103
Crimes committed by young people

00:45:39.536 --> 00:45:43.240
are often a reflection of
deeper societal issues.

00:45:43.540 --> 00:45:47.578
Of course, this is just
my personal opinion.

00:45:54.318 --> 00:45:55.452
What's wrong?

00:45:57.121 --> 00:45:58.122
Nothing.

00:46:11.735 --> 00:46:15.038
There's a phrase,
"The personal is political."

00:46:16.106 --> 00:46:20.878
It means that individual
struggles are political issues.

00:46:21.545 --> 00:46:22.613
I believe that

00:46:22.746 --> 00:46:26.250
the personal circumstances of
students and teachers in education

00:46:26.316 --> 00:46:30.788
should be considered part of
Japan' education system as a whole.

00:46:30.888 --> 00:46:34.858
As such,
I will continue to reflect on

00:46:35.392 --> 00:46:40.197
this inescapable responsibility
as a educator.

00:46:41.431 --> 00:46:45.068
Shall we move on to the main topic?

00:46:46.737 --> 00:46:49.506
Rintoku Academy,
with its unique education system

00:46:49.606 --> 00:46:53.710
has risen to the top ranks in Japan
for Tokyo University admissions.

00:46:59.683 --> 00:47:02.452
To Mikami Takashi

00:47:17.201 --> 00:47:18.702
I heard from Tsubuki.

00:47:18.802 --> 00:47:20.871
You and Mikami had
a pretty intense confrontation.

00:47:21.205 --> 00:47:24.007
Yes. We ran into each other
at our usual diner.

00:47:24.141 --> 00:47:25.909
It felt like a complete fallout.

00:47:26.877 --> 00:47:28.812
You should keep that connection.

00:47:28.912 --> 00:47:30.314
You're not kids anymore.

00:47:32.649 --> 00:47:34.084
– Excuse me.
– Yes?

00:47:35.419 --> 00:47:37.321
Your guest has arrived.

00:47:39.656 --> 00:47:41.091
This is Makino.

00:47:41.525 --> 00:47:44.261
Today, I wanted to
introduce you to Mr. Nakaoka.

00:47:45.095 --> 00:47:46.096
I'm Makino.

00:47:47.431 --> 00:47:48.599
I'm Nakaoka.

00:47:50.801 --> 00:47:51.802
When I was younger

00:47:51.902 --> 00:47:54.037
I worked as a policy secretary
for a politician.

00:47:54.238 --> 00:47:57.307
Now, I run a small consulting firm.

00:47:57.441 --> 00:47:59.443
I hear you have
incredible connections.

00:47:59.910 --> 00:48:02.946
The man who bridged
Kasumigaseki and Nagatacho.

00:48:03.280 --> 00:48:04.982
Some call you
the "shadow matchmaker."

00:48:07.517 --> 00:48:09.386
Since Mikami isn't around

00:48:09.486 --> 00:48:12.656
I'd like you to get along with
our shadow matchmaker instead.

00:48:14.024 --> 00:48:18.228
Speaking of Mikami, I heard
he was sent to Rintoku Academy.

00:48:18.495 --> 00:48:19.496
That's right.

00:48:19.696 --> 00:48:22.599
Our first ever bureaucratic dispatch
to a private high school.

00:48:24.234 --> 00:48:26.536
Mr. Mikami is
quite the handsome fellow

00:48:26.770 --> 00:48:29.106
but you're on
another level, Mr. Makino.

00:48:29.406 --> 00:48:30.908
Oh my.

00:48:31.141 --> 00:48:33.610
That kind of talk
isn't in vogue anymore.

00:48:34.945 --> 00:48:36.647
You mean "lookism"?

00:48:36.880 --> 00:48:39.049
Of course, I'm aware of such terms.

00:48:39.249 --> 00:48:45.022
But in Nagatacho,
appearances still matter quite a lot.

00:48:45.956 --> 00:48:47.624
Just look at Mr. Tsukada.

00:48:48.091 --> 00:48:49.192
My oh my.

00:48:49.493 --> 00:48:53.430
Makino, you'd better make sure
the politicians take a liking to you.

00:48:54.498 --> 00:48:56.900
All right then, let's have a toast.

00:48:57.200 --> 00:48:59.636
– Cheers.
– Cheers.

00:49:06.009 --> 00:49:08.912
Now then, enough small talk.

00:49:09.646 --> 00:49:11.315
Since we haven't
seen each other in a while

00:49:11.448 --> 00:49:14.651
a few requests have
piled up for you, Mr. Tsukada.

00:49:15.252 --> 00:49:16.753
Come now.

00:49:16.820 --> 00:49:18.689
The way you put it,
you make me sound like

00:49:18.789 --> 00:49:21.358
a cat-shaped robot that can
pull anything out of his pocket.

00:49:21.858 --> 00:49:23.860
The biggest issue is Rintoku.

00:49:24.695 --> 00:49:28.031
Right.
Let's not talk about that here.

00:49:30.167 --> 00:49:33.837
My apologies. In that case,
let's just drink tonight.

00:49:35.672 --> 00:49:36.707
Let's do that.

00:49:40.043 --> 00:49:41.511
– Excuse me.
– Yes?

00:49:42.913 --> 00:49:43.914
Here they come.

00:49:43.981 --> 00:49:45.315
Please make yourself comfortable.

00:49:45.415 --> 00:49:47.884
– Thank you.
– That's right.

00:49:51.521 --> 00:49:53.023
He's taking the morning off?

00:49:53.790 --> 00:49:55.759
Mr. Mikami sure has a lot of freedom.

00:49:55.859 --> 00:49:57.961
Must be nice to be
a bureaucratic dispatch.

00:49:59.429 --> 00:50:01.365
Maybe I should
take the afternoon off, too.

00:50:07.270 --> 00:50:11.608
Ms. Koreeda, do you know
why he took a half-day?

00:50:13.443 --> 00:50:14.444
No.

00:50:27.424 --> 00:50:29.259
Tokyo Detention Center

00:50:29.359 --> 00:50:32.095
Visitation Reception Desk

00:50:37.868 --> 00:50:40.504
General Visitation

00:52:35.952 --> 00:52:37.354
Mayama Yuzuru.

00:53:08.285 --> 00:53:13.290
You're a bureaucrat, right?

00:53:15.458 --> 00:53:16.459
That's right.

00:53:17.494 --> 00:53:19.029
That's why I agreed to meet you.

00:53:20.363 --> 00:53:21.364
That's all.

00:53:28.772 --> 00:53:31.408
Shall we talk about
the person you killed?

00:53:35.579 --> 00:53:36.580
What?

00:53:36.813 --> 00:53:39.216
Shibutani Yusuke, 21 years old.

00:53:40.350 --> 00:53:42.586
He was a junior in Tokyo University's
Law Department.

00:53:44.321 --> 00:53:46.356
He took the civil service exam
in his junior year

00:53:46.556 --> 00:53:49.392
so he could focus on the bar exam.

00:53:50.827 --> 00:53:53.029
It was almost certain he would pass.

00:53:55.398 --> 00:53:59.903
His actual test scores were
within the passing range.

00:54:00.503 --> 00:54:03.440
– So he took it as a backup?
– You could say that.

00:54:04.274 --> 00:54:06.776
His real goal was
the bar exam after all.

00:54:10.847 --> 00:54:12.415
I decided to kill

00:54:12.482 --> 00:54:15.885
the most arrogant-looking person
at the exam site.

00:54:18.388 --> 00:54:23.159
Guess my intuition wasn't wrong.

00:54:23.260 --> 00:54:26.029
His parents divorced
when he was in middle school.

00:54:26.896 --> 00:54:28.131
His mom raised him by herself

00:54:28.198 --> 00:54:29.899
and got him
all the way to Tokyo University.

00:54:31.735 --> 00:54:38.008
It's easy to imagine that
Shibutani Yusuke was her everything.

00:54:45.715 --> 00:54:47.751
– Good morning.
– Good morning.

00:54:50.253 --> 00:54:51.288
Looking sharp as always.

00:54:51.388 --> 00:54:52.389
Thank you very much.

00:54:52.989 --> 00:54:54.658
And as far as I can see...

00:54:55.792 --> 00:55:00.297
Even with your life-risking actions,
society hasn't changed at all.

00:55:02.165 --> 00:55:05.235
The lawyer's chair that
Shibutani Yusuke could've sat in

00:55:05.302 --> 00:55:06.603
is now quietly empty.

00:55:07.504 --> 00:55:10.774
Starting next year, there will be
stricter bag checks for exam takers.

00:55:10.874 --> 00:55:11.975
That's about it.

00:55:13.910 --> 00:55:16.146
Did you come here just to say
something so pointless?

00:55:16.246 --> 00:55:17.347
Why did you kill him?

00:55:22.085 --> 00:55:24.020
– Good morning.
– Good morning.

00:55:32.829 --> 00:55:34.898
Do you need something?

00:55:37.400 --> 00:55:40.070
Why was Ms. Saejima
the only one forced to resign?

00:55:46.976 --> 00:55:49.512
Why do you need a reason so badly?

00:55:50.647 --> 00:55:53.750
Kanzaki, I've been
wanting to talk to you.

00:55:54.884 --> 00:55:59.322
This academy was created
to nurture young people like you.

00:56:00.290 --> 00:56:03.126
Independent thinkers
who can make their own judgments.

00:56:04.094 --> 00:56:08.064
One has finally appeared.
It took 20 years.

00:56:09.599 --> 00:56:10.734
I'm thrilled.

00:56:12.936 --> 00:56:14.738
Was she fired because she's a woman?

00:56:15.772 --> 00:56:20.210
We would never do something
so backward in this era.

00:56:21.878 --> 00:56:23.847
Killing someone in
a place like that...

00:56:25.048 --> 00:56:28.685
Anyone but the most dense person
would take that as a message.

00:56:29.986 --> 00:56:34.991
I offered both of them
a transfer to the Rintoku Seminar.

00:56:35.091 --> 00:56:38.661
It was Ms. Saejima's
decision to refuse.

00:56:40.029 --> 00:56:41.231
That's unfortunate.

00:56:43.700 --> 00:56:44.701
That's a lie.

00:56:50.440 --> 00:56:55.378
If that's what you think,
why not investigate it yourself?

00:57:33.716 --> 00:57:34.884
Maybe it's terrorism?

00:57:37.620 --> 00:57:38.955
Or perhaps...

00:57:42.459 --> 00:57:43.593
A revolution?

00:57:48.765 --> 00:57:50.467
This world is distorted.

00:57:50.834 --> 00:57:53.603
To destroy it,
you need maximum impact.

00:57:56.139 --> 00:57:57.140
Am I wrong?

00:58:01.945 --> 00:58:03.480
A long time ago...

00:58:06.015 --> 00:58:08.151
someone said the exact same thing.

00:58:10.520 --> 00:58:13.122
I want to correct what's wrong.

00:58:14.524 --> 00:58:15.992
And to do that...

00:58:19.329 --> 00:58:21.364
I have to destroy it first.

00:58:26.102 --> 00:58:27.103
What?

00:58:29.873 --> 00:58:31.808
That person was important to me.

00:58:57.567 --> 00:59:00.203
Are you afraid
Kanzaki will be the next victim?

00:59:00.303 --> 00:59:03.039
Did you think killing just one person
would be enough to change society?

00:59:03.139 --> 00:59:04.307
Don't compare me to those people!

00:59:04.407 --> 00:59:07.510
Why did you come to this school?
For revenge? Or...
