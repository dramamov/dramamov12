00:00:17.584 --> 00:00:19.586
What I was looking for

00:00:20.854 --> 00:00:22.389
was only one thing.

00:00:25.525 --> 00:00:28.328
A happy family with my true love...

00:00:32.165 --> 00:00:34.868
that sparkles like diamonds.

00:00:37.704 --> 00:00:38.805
I was hoping someday

00:00:40.206 --> 00:00:44.177
my prince on a white horse
would come.

00:00:46.513 --> 00:00:48.314
That was my wish forever.

00:00:52.852 --> 00:00:54.187
All I want

00:00:55.255 --> 00:00:57.257
is someone I love

00:00:58.124 --> 00:01:02.262
someone dear to my heart
who would love me back.

00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:05.765
Happiness to me

00:01:06.933 --> 00:01:08.535
would be for that to happen.

00:01:10.537 --> 00:01:12.939
I'd be happy if he were my first
and my only love.

00:01:14.474 --> 00:01:16.109
When we tied the knot

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:20.146
we vowed to protect our love forever.

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:26.019
That pledge hasn't changed
since then.

00:01:28.888 --> 00:01:31.191
He's the only one for me until I die.

00:01:32.492 --> 00:01:34.294
I never thought of

00:01:35.261 --> 00:01:36.663
loving anyone else.

00:01:39.999 --> 00:01:43.036
Gosh, I dropped it. Where did it go?

00:01:43.736 --> 00:01:44.737
It's over there.

00:01:45.839 --> 00:01:47.040
Can you pick it up, Tsubasa?

00:01:47.373 --> 00:01:48.641
You dropped it, Dad.

00:01:48.875 --> 00:01:51.010
Not once did this happiness

00:01:51.678 --> 00:01:52.679
seem to waver.

00:01:52.745 --> 00:01:54.881
Can you pick up my fork, Minori?

00:01:57.484 --> 00:01:58.485
Minori?

00:02:04.023 --> 00:02:05.758
I dropped my fork. Can you get it?

00:02:11.998 --> 00:02:14.534
Not once did this happiness

00:02:16.002 --> 00:02:17.170
seem to waver.

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:25.778
In the 17 years since we met

00:02:27.413 --> 00:02:29.082
not once, ever.

00:02:39.159 --> 00:02:40.193
Yudai.

00:02:43.029 --> 00:02:44.597
Your phone is lit up.

00:02:51.504 --> 00:02:52.505
That's why

00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:56.743
- Thank you.
- I can never forgive this.

00:02:58.178 --> 00:02:59.212
Have a nice day.

00:03:05.518 --> 00:03:06.819
You just wait and see.

00:03:09.656 --> 00:03:12.225
If no one else will judge this sin

00:03:16.329 --> 00:03:18.598
then I will administer
the punishment.

00:04:12.418 --> 00:04:17.657
UNTIL I DESTROYED
MY HUSBAND'S OTHER FAMILY

00:04:18.758 --> 00:04:20.093
Doubt him?

00:04:22.729 --> 00:04:24.264
Never. Of course not.

00:04:25.465 --> 00:04:27.200
What? Never?

00:04:28.768 --> 00:04:31.204
Because he and I...

00:04:32.372 --> 00:04:33.773
You should know this.

00:04:35.241 --> 00:04:37.744
From the moment we met

00:04:38.745 --> 00:04:40.280
on that day

00:04:41.781 --> 00:04:43.149
seventeen years ago...

00:04:45.151 --> 00:04:46.386
Always.

00:04:50.456 --> 00:04:52.992
How can you be so clumsy?

00:04:53.192 --> 00:04:54.560
I'm sorry.

00:04:54.894 --> 00:04:57.230
It should be around here somewhere.

00:04:58.531 --> 00:04:59.632
Hey, excuse me.

00:05:02.235 --> 00:05:03.336
Did you lose this?

00:05:03.636 --> 00:05:04.704
Oh, that's it!

00:05:05.605 --> 00:05:08.941
That's mine. I've been looking
for it since yesterday.

00:05:11.778 --> 00:05:12.779
But how?

00:05:13.146 --> 00:05:14.480
How did you know it was mine?

00:05:15.915 --> 00:05:17.684
You always keep it
like you cherish it.

00:05:19.319 --> 00:05:21.754
You noticed me before?

00:05:22.522 --> 00:05:23.523
Well...

00:05:24.524 --> 00:05:28.461
For some time,
I thought you were cute.

00:05:30.029 --> 00:05:33.166
I just remembered I have a date.
I'll be going now.

00:05:33.232 --> 00:05:35.735
Didn't you say you broke up with him?

00:05:36.336 --> 00:05:37.403
Hey, Sara?

00:05:46.913 --> 00:05:48.948
It was my first love.

00:05:51.551 --> 00:05:53.186
Meeting Yudai

00:05:53.686 --> 00:05:55.822
changed my whole world.

00:05:58.257 --> 00:06:00.293
Every mundane day

00:06:01.160 --> 00:06:02.862
felt special with him.

00:06:09.535 --> 00:06:11.938
I still remember

00:06:12.839 --> 00:06:14.240
the first time we kissed.

00:06:15.708 --> 00:06:18.578
I felt happy and safe.

00:06:20.513 --> 00:06:22.048
Ten years later

00:06:23.282 --> 00:06:24.450
we exchanged

00:06:25.218 --> 00:06:27.153
- I'm home.
- our vows.

00:06:27.220 --> 00:06:28.588
Dad is home.

00:06:37.196 --> 00:06:40.233
What? It looks like nobody's home.

00:06:40.299 --> 00:06:41.834
- Welcome home!
- Welcome home!

00:06:41.901 --> 00:06:43.770
Then Tsubasa was born.

00:06:44.470 --> 00:06:46.406
Our happiness didn't change.

00:06:47.874 --> 00:06:50.643
I could feel a sense
of gentle love every day.

00:06:51.844 --> 00:06:52.845
But...

00:06:52.912 --> 00:06:55.848
Tsukishiro Group,
a leading jewelry manufacturer

00:06:56.115 --> 00:06:58.184
opened their first store in Europe

00:06:58.251 --> 00:07:02.355
in the center of Paris, France.

00:07:03.156 --> 00:07:06.659
Since 2020, they've opened stores
in Singapore and South Korea...

00:07:07.160 --> 00:07:08.995
Tsubasa fell asleep again.

00:07:10.963 --> 00:07:13.299
They intend to promote
their brand in France...

00:07:13.366 --> 00:07:14.934
Will you put him to sleep in the bed?

00:07:15.802 --> 00:07:18.838
The new store will be located
on Champs-Élysées

00:07:18.905 --> 00:07:20.807
where there are many luxury brands...

00:07:21.274 --> 00:07:22.375
Yudai!

00:07:24.844 --> 00:07:26.546
Oh, I'm sorry. What?

00:07:27.046 --> 00:07:29.348
Can you please take Tsubasa to bed?

00:07:30.716 --> 00:07:31.717
Okay.

00:07:32.285 --> 00:07:34.187
At the new store...

00:07:34.253 --> 00:07:35.254
Tsubasa.

00:07:35.955 --> 00:07:37.223
Let's go.

00:07:37.290 --> 00:07:41.661
...said, "We want to match
the sophistication of Paris

00:07:42.228 --> 00:07:47.200
and want customers from around
the world to have a special time"...

00:07:47.967 --> 00:07:49.035
Yudai.

00:07:49.502 --> 00:07:52.805
Will you pick up the dry cleaning
on the way home tomorrow?

00:07:53.806 --> 00:07:56.075
I'm sorry. I'm having
a business dinner with the team.

00:07:56.409 --> 00:07:58.077
Oh, it's Tuesday tomorrow.

00:07:58.377 --> 00:08:00.513
I can pick it up
the day after tomorrow.

00:08:00.580 --> 00:08:02.048
Okay. Please do so.

00:08:02.448 --> 00:08:04.217
Thank you for understanding.
I'm going now.

00:08:05.017 --> 00:08:06.018
Have a good day.

00:08:12.291 --> 00:08:13.960
Mom, he forgot this.

00:08:14.193 --> 00:08:16.562
- Oh, no! I'll give it to him.
- Okay.

00:08:30.710 --> 00:08:32.712
Can I wait for you at this store?

00:08:32.778 --> 00:08:34.580
TSUKISHIRO JEWELRY GINZA

00:08:48.394 --> 00:08:50.096
I'm sorry, I forgot my phone.

00:08:52.365 --> 00:08:55.067
- Here.
- Thank you. See you.

00:09:09.215 --> 00:09:12.151
That's it? That's why you think
your husband is having an affair?

00:09:12.552 --> 00:09:14.720
But something is clearly off.

00:09:15.454 --> 00:09:18.424
Why would he meet someone
at Tsukishiro Jewelry?

00:09:20.459 --> 00:09:21.694
Well, maybe

00:09:22.061 --> 00:09:25.498
he met a colleague there
before the business dinner

00:09:26.599 --> 00:09:28.701
and chose a present for you?

00:09:31.170 --> 00:09:32.171
Well...

00:09:33.005 --> 00:09:34.006
Yes.

00:09:34.473 --> 00:09:36.609
Maybe he did, but...

00:09:37.743 --> 00:09:41.614
You're being too paranoid. You've
been that way since you were young.

00:09:43.883 --> 00:09:45.217
Am I?

00:09:47.587 --> 00:09:51.123
Listen, Minori.
Lawyers are busy people.

00:09:51.190 --> 00:09:54.160
Could you not come to my office
for something as trivial as this?

00:09:59.298 --> 00:10:01.067
He acts cold to Tsubasa, I think.

00:10:04.937 --> 00:10:06.472
It's hard to describe it, but...

00:10:08.374 --> 00:10:09.942
he seems uninterested

00:10:11.611 --> 00:10:13.212
in Tsubasa.

00:10:15.247 --> 00:10:16.782
He seems indifferent to him.

00:10:17.249 --> 00:10:18.784
Indifferent to his own son?

00:10:20.720 --> 00:10:21.854
I'm thinking maybe

00:10:23.055 --> 00:10:25.758
he didn't want children.

00:10:26.058 --> 00:10:28.327
No, that's impossible.

00:10:29.261 --> 00:10:30.262
Hey.

00:10:32.331 --> 00:10:34.033
What if he's cheating on me?

00:10:38.037 --> 00:10:39.438
I can't tolerate that.

00:10:41.340 --> 00:10:42.942
If Yudai is having an affair...

00:10:46.212 --> 00:10:47.213
Minori.

00:10:49.081 --> 00:10:50.082
Don't worry.

00:10:50.816 --> 00:10:52.985
He's not the type
to do something like that.

00:10:59.458 --> 00:11:03.596
- He loves me, he loves me not.
- He loves me, he loves me not.

00:11:04.296 --> 00:11:06.932
- He loves me, he loves me not.
- He loves me, he loves me not.

00:11:07.199 --> 00:11:09.935
- He loves me, he loves me not.
- He loves me, he loves me not.

00:11:10.136 --> 00:11:13.005
He loves me, he loves me not.

00:11:17.643 --> 00:11:19.512
Let's do it again.

00:11:21.947 --> 00:11:23.449
Come on. Once more.

00:11:24.750 --> 00:11:28.020
But what if it doesn't end
with "he loves me"?

00:11:28.220 --> 00:11:31.624
Well, maybe it will.

00:11:32.024 --> 00:11:33.092
He loves me.

00:11:47.173 --> 00:11:48.307
You're home.

00:11:49.208 --> 00:11:52.178
- Yudai?
- I came home early from work.

00:11:52.311 --> 00:11:54.213
I picked up Tsubasa on the way home.

00:11:54.780 --> 00:11:56.382
Welcome back, Mom!

00:11:56.882 --> 00:11:58.117
Tsubasa.

00:12:01.887 --> 00:12:04.957
- Three, two, one, ta-da!
- Three, two, one, ta-da!

00:12:06.892 --> 00:12:08.594
You made omelet rice?

00:12:08.661 --> 00:12:11.597
Yes! Actually, I made this.

00:12:11.664 --> 00:12:13.966
You made it, didn't you?

00:12:14.033 --> 00:12:16.802
Here, show Mom her omelet rice.

00:12:16.869 --> 00:12:19.305
Okay. Ta-da!

00:12:21.507 --> 00:12:24.477
It says "Mom" on it.
Did you write it?

00:12:24.543 --> 00:12:28.013
- Yes!
- That's wonderful, Tsubasa!

00:12:29.248 --> 00:12:33.586
But Dad wanted to draw a heart,
and so he drew this heart.

00:12:34.220 --> 00:12:35.287
He did?

00:12:35.521 --> 00:12:37.456
Yes. Isn't that amazing?

00:12:40.993 --> 00:12:42.361
Yes, it's amazing.

00:12:45.865 --> 00:12:47.066
Our plan was a success.

00:12:47.133 --> 00:12:49.668
MOM

00:13:00.279 --> 00:13:01.280
What's the matter?

00:13:04.016 --> 00:13:05.017
I'm sorry.

00:13:05.918 --> 00:13:07.953
What is it, all of a sudden?

00:13:13.793 --> 00:13:15.127
Since we're always together

00:13:16.462 --> 00:13:18.664
I take happiness for granted.

00:13:20.232 --> 00:13:21.867
I stopped noticing some things.

00:13:24.804 --> 00:13:25.805
Minori.

00:13:26.338 --> 00:13:27.907
Were you troubled by something?

00:13:30.776 --> 00:13:32.945
No, it's nothing.

00:13:44.190 --> 00:13:46.625
Hey, rinse your mouth first.

00:13:46.759 --> 00:13:47.960
Does it matter?

00:14:11.317 --> 00:14:12.618
Can I wait for you at this store?

00:14:38.110 --> 00:14:40.112
See you tomorrow! Good night.

00:14:48.420 --> 00:14:50.089
- Ms. Matsuzaki.
- Yes.

00:14:50.322 --> 00:14:53.993
Can you check these numbers
and submit this to the manager?

00:14:54.059 --> 00:14:55.928
- Sure.
- I'm counting on you.

00:14:58.731 --> 00:15:00.099
Wakako.

00:15:00.366 --> 00:15:03.168
- Yes?
- Isn't Mr. Kisaragi perfect?

00:15:03.535 --> 00:15:05.404
He's good-looking, pleasant

00:15:05.471 --> 00:15:07.539
he's competent,
and nice to everybody.

00:15:07.606 --> 00:15:09.241
- Too good to be true.
- Definitely.

00:15:09.308 --> 00:15:12.244
But unfortunately, he's married.

00:15:12.311 --> 00:15:14.480
What is his wife like?

00:15:15.681 --> 00:15:17.416
A younger woman
he went to school with.

00:15:17.483 --> 00:15:19.685
I'd lock onto him
from high school, too.

00:15:19.752 --> 00:15:21.620
- Pure love.
- Definitely.

00:15:23.689 --> 00:15:26.025
Mr. Kisaragi, the materials
for the meeting tomorrow.

00:15:26.091 --> 00:15:27.459
Oh, thank you.

00:15:27.526 --> 00:15:28.961
Mr. Kisaragi?

00:15:29.762 --> 00:15:31.597
How about going for a drink tonight?

00:15:31.664 --> 00:15:33.933
I'm sorry, I have plans for tonight.

00:15:33.999 --> 00:15:35.334
What?

00:15:35.401 --> 00:15:38.704
It feels like you're always busy
every Tuesday.

00:15:39.171 --> 00:15:40.639
It's just a coincidence.

00:15:40.906 --> 00:15:43.842
It's just a guess,
but are you going out with your wife?

00:15:44.944 --> 00:15:48.247
You need to hurry up
and find someone.

00:15:48.480 --> 00:15:49.481
What's that?

00:15:49.815 --> 00:15:51.350
Are you trying to one-up me?

00:15:51.417 --> 00:15:52.751
- You were, weren't you?
- No.

00:15:52.818 --> 00:15:54.586
You were trying to one-up me.

00:15:54.653 --> 00:15:56.055
Oh, stop it.

00:16:16.075 --> 00:16:17.276
I'm sorry I'm late.

00:16:24.550 --> 00:16:26.018
- Did you have to wait?
- Not much.

00:16:26.085 --> 00:16:27.119
Let's go.

00:16:34.093 --> 00:16:35.094
I'm sorry I'm late.

00:16:41.300 --> 00:16:43.235
I didn't wait long.

00:16:43.635 --> 00:16:45.270
Did you come from cram school again?

00:16:45.337 --> 00:16:46.438
Yes. I'm so tired.

00:16:46.505 --> 00:16:47.506
A man?

00:16:51.010 --> 00:16:52.611
- Is this the place?
- Yes.

00:16:53.045 --> 00:16:54.079
- Should we go in?
- Yes.

00:16:55.381 --> 00:16:56.582
A high school student?

00:17:04.523 --> 00:17:05.991
What about this one, sir?

00:17:13.932 --> 00:17:15.167
What's their relationship?

00:17:24.076 --> 00:17:25.077
It can't be...

00:17:30.149 --> 00:17:31.150
No.

00:17:33.786 --> 00:17:35.220
What's more likely

00:17:36.989 --> 00:17:38.857
is that although it's impossible...

00:17:43.762 --> 00:17:46.565
they look as though
they're dad and son.

00:17:48.500 --> 00:17:49.501
Why?

00:18:11.557 --> 00:18:12.558
Who is that?

00:18:14.493 --> 00:18:15.661
MOTHER-IN-LAW

00:18:21.166 --> 00:18:22.167
Hello?

00:18:23.602 --> 00:18:24.937
Hello, is this Minori?

00:18:25.337 --> 00:18:29.108
Tsubasa can't find
his favorite dinosaur toy.

00:18:29.341 --> 00:18:30.742
Do you know where it is?

00:18:35.581 --> 00:18:36.815
Where's my dinosaur...

00:18:36.882 --> 00:18:38.350
The dinosaur toy is...

00:18:45.924 --> 00:18:48.527
- What?
- Minori? Hello?

00:18:52.898 --> 00:18:53.899
Hello?

00:19:16.889 --> 00:19:19.224
I couldn't comprehend
what was happening

00:19:20.159 --> 00:19:21.760
in front of my eyes.

00:19:26.632 --> 00:19:29.134
My husband was casually laughing

00:19:30.135 --> 00:19:32.204
with a high school student
I don't know

00:19:32.504 --> 00:19:33.505
and

00:19:34.506 --> 00:19:35.641
this woman.

00:19:40.879 --> 00:19:41.880
Mom.

00:19:46.852 --> 00:19:47.853
Hello.

00:19:49.288 --> 00:19:51.857
When are you coming home?
Where are you?

00:19:55.160 --> 00:19:56.528
I'll be right home.

00:20:28.794 --> 00:20:29.795
I'm home.

00:20:30.495 --> 00:20:33.432
I'm so sorry, Tsubasa.
I didn't mean to be late.

00:20:34.633 --> 00:20:36.635
He got tired of waiting for you
and fell asleep.

00:20:38.503 --> 00:20:41.306
I apologize for being late, Mother.

00:20:41.506 --> 00:20:46.178
No problem. I'm sorry I called you.
Is your friend okay?

00:20:47.312 --> 00:20:48.313
Yes.

00:20:48.614 --> 00:20:51.149
It had been a while since
we got together, so we got excited.

00:20:51.216 --> 00:20:52.251
I'm sorry.

00:20:52.317 --> 00:20:55.153
Don't you worry about me at all.

00:20:55.454 --> 00:20:58.123
I don't mind visiting every day
to see Tsubasa.

00:20:58.190 --> 00:20:59.258
Here, have some.

00:20:59.324 --> 00:21:02.628
I'm very grateful you would say that.

00:21:02.861 --> 00:21:04.730
Where's Yudai?
Isn't he coming home yet?

00:21:06.732 --> 00:21:07.866
Yudai is...

00:21:13.071 --> 00:21:16.341
Yudai seems
to be working late tonight.

00:21:17.509 --> 00:21:18.510
Goodness.

00:21:19.978 --> 00:21:24.082
If he ignores you too much,
you should let me know.

00:21:24.383 --> 00:21:25.717
I'll spank him.

00:21:26.585 --> 00:21:28.120
Thank you so much.

00:21:34.559 --> 00:21:35.560
So?

00:21:37.162 --> 00:21:38.764
Was he really cheating on you?

00:21:39.698 --> 00:21:40.699
I don't know.

00:21:42.467 --> 00:21:43.468
But I saw them

00:21:44.403 --> 00:21:45.837
buying a necklace together

00:21:46.338 --> 00:21:48.040
and giving it as a present
to that woman.

00:21:51.543 --> 00:21:52.544
If...

00:21:55.280 --> 00:21:56.815
he's really having an affair...

00:21:59.318 --> 00:22:00.385
what should I do?

00:22:04.589 --> 00:22:05.590
How about you?

00:22:06.792 --> 00:22:07.793
What do you want to do?

00:22:10.429 --> 00:22:11.430
I don't know.

00:22:13.398 --> 00:22:14.399
But...

00:22:15.767 --> 00:22:17.302
I could never forgive an affair.

00:22:21.973 --> 00:22:22.974
Then

00:22:24.743 --> 00:22:26.278
you need to make sure.

00:22:27.913 --> 00:22:28.914
What?

00:22:29.881 --> 00:22:31.983
You can't pretend not
to notice anymore, right?

00:22:38.256 --> 00:22:40.525
Oh, yes, about this Friday.

00:22:40.926 --> 00:22:42.060
I'm getting a haircut

00:22:42.127 --> 00:22:44.229
then going to drink
with friends from junior high.

00:22:45.997 --> 00:22:47.299
But how do I make sure?

00:22:47.833 --> 00:22:50.068
Tell me if Yudai acts strangely.

00:22:50.802 --> 00:22:52.871
He acts suspiciously every Tuesday

00:22:53.071 --> 00:22:55.474
but maybe there are other days
he meets that woman, too.

00:22:57.876 --> 00:22:58.877
Okay.

00:23:00.746 --> 00:23:02.647
Try not to drink too much.

00:23:03.181 --> 00:23:04.783
I know that.

00:23:08.387 --> 00:23:09.388
But...

00:23:10.722 --> 00:23:12.824
no matter what the facts are

00:23:14.192 --> 00:23:15.594
you will have to accept them.

00:23:18.230 --> 00:23:19.464
Are you prepared for it?

00:23:43.021 --> 00:23:45.056
Baby boy

00:23:45.490 --> 00:23:49.461
I'm right here

00:23:50.028 --> 00:23:53.465
Waiting for you
I'm not going anywhere

00:24:00.205 --> 00:24:01.940
- Kusunoki.
- Yes?

00:24:03.308 --> 00:24:04.309
Come here for a moment.

00:24:06.278 --> 00:24:07.279
Here.

00:24:07.913 --> 00:24:09.548
You don't like green beans?

00:24:10.615 --> 00:24:11.917
I'm not fond of them.

00:24:12.117 --> 00:24:16.321
No matter how far apart we are

00:24:16.955 --> 00:24:19.658
You shouldn't be picky about
the daily lunches she makes for you.

00:24:20.192 --> 00:24:21.860
You should be thanking your wife.

00:24:21.927 --> 00:24:23.395
I do thank her.

00:24:23.562 --> 00:24:27.365
My love for you will never change

00:24:27.499 --> 00:24:29.534
- Oh, how about tonight--
- I'm sorry.

00:24:29.601 --> 00:24:30.936
I have plans for tonight.

00:24:31.036 --> 00:24:35.106
You must know what I mean to say

00:24:35.240 --> 00:24:36.775
Prior commitment.

00:24:37.075 --> 00:24:39.411
I'll be waiting

00:24:42.781 --> 00:24:46.351
For you

00:24:50.188 --> 00:24:51.289
I see.

00:24:51.356 --> 00:24:52.491
Were you busy today?

00:24:52.557 --> 00:24:54.259
I was extremely busy today.

00:24:54.326 --> 00:24:55.560
Your face looks a bit tired.

00:24:55.827 --> 00:24:58.463
About this Friday.
I'm getting a haircut

00:24:58.530 --> 00:25:00.565
then going to drink
with friends from junior high.

00:25:02.167 --> 00:25:03.335
Tell me, Yudai.

00:25:06.371 --> 00:25:09.241
That scene couldn't have been
what I thought it was, right?

00:25:11.977 --> 00:25:13.178
Starting tomorrow

00:25:14.145 --> 00:25:16.848
we'll return
to our ordinary lives, won't we?

00:25:18.583 --> 00:25:19.918
Our ordinary lives

00:25:21.052 --> 00:25:22.287
of happiness...

00:25:49.948 --> 00:25:52.417
My hope was shattered
in that instant.

00:25:57.622 --> 00:25:58.890
Staying at my place tonight?

00:26:00.025 --> 00:26:02.994
I can tell she's whispering
those words in his ear.

00:26:08.600 --> 00:26:10.635
I loved that smile.

00:26:13.438 --> 00:26:14.639
That smile

00:26:15.640 --> 00:26:17.208
used to be mine.

00:26:23.848 --> 00:26:26.084
That smile of his was only mine.

00:26:31.056 --> 00:26:33.692
Why didn't I realize it until now?

00:26:42.734 --> 00:26:43.735
Hello.

00:26:43.935 --> 00:26:46.304
- Hi, Wataru. Are you done studying?
- Yes.

00:26:46.671 --> 00:26:48.540
I'm so hungry. What's for dinner?

00:26:48.707 --> 00:26:50.542
- It's curry today.
- Great.

00:26:52.577 --> 00:26:55.146
I just saw people filming something
near the station.

00:26:55.213 --> 00:26:56.381
- Really?
- Yes.

00:27:08.460 --> 00:27:09.694
I've come this far

00:27:11.262 --> 00:27:12.764
and finally, I realize now.

00:27:16.635 --> 00:27:17.702
Yudai

00:27:19.437 --> 00:27:20.505
is having an affair.

00:27:27.579 --> 00:27:28.813
You ate it all.

00:27:30.148 --> 00:27:31.983
Yes, I did. It was good.

00:27:33.952 --> 00:27:35.520
Didn't you hate green beans?

00:27:36.554 --> 00:27:41.126
Hey, you knew and you put them in?
That's mean.

00:27:41.192 --> 00:27:42.460
But I ate them anyway.

00:27:43.561 --> 00:27:44.562
Okay.

00:27:48.466 --> 00:27:49.467
Your hair...

00:27:50.902 --> 00:27:52.170
doesn't look much different.

00:27:52.704 --> 00:27:54.839
What? You think so?

00:27:55.940 --> 00:27:58.209
Maybe you don't need to go
to the barber so often.

00:28:00.945 --> 00:28:03.615
But my hair grows out quickly.

00:28:05.383 --> 00:28:07.052
I'm going to go get a shower.

00:28:08.319 --> 00:28:09.888
Wash your hair thoroughly.

00:28:13.224 --> 00:28:14.225
What?

00:28:18.663 --> 00:28:20.231
Because I smell curry.

00:28:23.234 --> 00:28:27.205
Oh, the restaurant served curry
at the end of the night.

00:28:31.943 --> 00:28:33.778
- I see.
- Yes.

00:28:57.802 --> 00:29:00.071
When did the relationship
with that woman start?

00:29:02.073 --> 00:29:04.476
Since when did you betray me?

00:29:14.385 --> 00:29:15.820

00:30:26.391 --> 00:30:27.826
Jealousy

00:30:35.366 --> 00:30:36.734
Now that I've come this far

00:30:38.002 --> 00:30:39.170
I can't turn back.

00:30:40.238 --> 00:30:41.239
ENTER PASSCODE

00:30:44.342 --> 00:30:46.611
Thank you as always, Mother.

00:30:46.678 --> 00:30:49.781
Don't mention it. I make more
than I could eat alone, anyway.

00:30:50.081 --> 00:30:52.250
I'm happy
when I can share it with you.

00:30:53.284 --> 00:30:57.188
Tsubasa said Grandma's
chikuwa salad is so good.

00:30:57.889 --> 00:30:58.990
How nice to hear!

00:30:59.057 --> 00:31:01.659
Yudai used to love it
when he was small, too.

00:31:01.726 --> 00:31:05.230
He just eats and doesn't do many
house chores, does he?

00:31:10.869 --> 00:31:11.870
He does.

00:31:12.570 --> 00:31:14.205
He helps me around the house a lot.

00:31:15.039 --> 00:31:17.508
Really? That's good.

00:31:19.911 --> 00:31:21.446
Hey, Grandma!

00:31:21.512 --> 00:31:24.015
- Come here for a minute.
- Okay.

00:31:26.584 --> 00:31:29.120
His mom is so good to me.

00:31:30.121 --> 00:31:32.056
- I can't possibly tell her.
- I'll start from here.

00:31:34.192 --> 00:31:35.360
Let me do it, too.

00:31:36.427 --> 00:31:37.762
Then I'll do this.

00:31:41.132 --> 00:31:42.133
Okay.

00:31:47.972 --> 00:31:48.973
Hello?

00:31:49.474 --> 00:31:50.675
I saw the photos.

00:31:51.442 --> 00:31:54.512
I can't believe it.
He's absolutely guilty.

00:31:57.181 --> 00:31:58.182
Listen, Minori.

00:32:00.652 --> 00:32:01.653
This woman.

00:32:01.953 --> 00:32:03.755
I recognize her, too.

00:32:07.892 --> 00:32:08.893
What?

00:32:09.961 --> 00:32:12.096
Isn't it weird
that we both recognize her?

00:32:13.398 --> 00:32:17.001
We only have one thing
in common, right?

00:32:20.338 --> 00:32:21.339
Yudai.

00:32:40.758 --> 00:32:42.427

00:33:20.531 --> 00:33:22.567
RIKO MIYAKE

00:33:24.068 --> 00:33:25.303
Bye.

00:33:32.410 --> 00:33:33.711
Since high school?

00:33:34.479 --> 00:33:36.614

ENTER PASSCODE

00:33:44.489 --> 00:33:45.490
That day

00:33:46.324 --> 00:33:48.760
when the three of them
were in a restaurant together

00:33:50.294 --> 00:33:51.295
was probably...

00:33:53.931 --> 00:33:55.566
that woman's birthday.

00:33:56.934 --> 00:33:58.069
When was that day?

00:33:59.003 --> 00:34:04.509
ENTER PASSCODE

00:34:10.982 --> 00:34:12.750
RIKO

ALBUM, MEMORIES

00:34:19.090 --> 00:34:22.460
ALBUM, MEMORIES

00:34:25.129 --> 00:34:26.831
Our wedding vows...

00:34:28.366 --> 00:34:30.034
His words to me...

00:34:31.202 --> 00:34:32.904
The smile he gave me...

00:34:33.371 --> 00:34:34.605
FEBRUARY 2024, TRIP TO THE HOT SPRING

00:34:34.672 --> 00:34:35.673
They were all...

00:34:37.041 --> 00:34:38.242
AUGUST 2023, WATARU'S SOCCER GAME

00:34:38.309 --> 00:34:40.678
not only for me.

00:35:08.806 --> 00:35:10.641
He had another family

00:35:12.076 --> 00:35:13.578
besides ours.

00:36:04.262 --> 00:36:05.363
I'll never

00:36:06.797 --> 00:36:07.798
forgive them.

00:36:17.241 --> 00:36:18.442
I investigated them

00:36:19.677 --> 00:36:22.446
but I couldn't find out
who the boy's dad was.

00:36:24.148 --> 00:36:25.316
You want a divorce, right?

00:36:30.288 --> 00:36:35.393
Show them the proof of infidelity,
demand compensation, then file.

00:36:35.459 --> 00:36:36.727
I'll be your divorce attorney.

00:36:37.728 --> 00:36:39.997
For compensation
of a measly few million yen?

00:36:40.765 --> 00:36:42.033
I understand what you mean.

00:36:43.901 --> 00:36:46.304
- But--
- What about my feelings?

00:36:53.578 --> 00:36:55.913
Why is infidelity not a crime?

00:37:00.518 --> 00:37:03.788
Why aren't they judged
for their sins?

00:37:09.260 --> 00:37:10.561
I'm sorry, Wataru.

00:37:11.062 --> 00:37:14.131
I want to eat with you.
What should I make?

00:37:14.999 --> 00:37:16.000
Curry.

00:37:16.067 --> 00:37:17.768
We just had curry the other day.

00:37:18.402 --> 00:37:19.470
Wait.

00:37:20.638 --> 00:37:22.139
You have bed head.

00:37:22.940 --> 00:37:24.175
To a mom

00:37:24.742 --> 00:37:27.078
her son is irreplaceable.

00:37:29.413 --> 00:37:31.482
I can relate so much, it hurts.

00:37:38.990 --> 00:37:40.358
Attention everybody.

00:37:41.726 --> 00:37:44.695
We have a new tutor starting today.

00:37:45.329 --> 00:37:46.931
Over here, please.

00:37:47.632 --> 00:37:49.634
I can never forgive this.

00:37:52.036 --> 00:37:54.438
Infidelity wrecks families.

00:37:58.109 --> 00:38:00.778
Where's my dad?

00:38:01.746 --> 00:38:03.581
Do I have any other family?

00:38:07.852 --> 00:38:09.987
This is my revenge.

00:38:11.856 --> 00:38:12.890
I'll do it

00:38:14.525 --> 00:38:16.193
in my own way.

00:38:17.128 --> 00:38:18.429
My name is Minori Kume.

00:38:20.064 --> 00:38:21.532
Nice to meet you.

00:38:27.838 --> 00:38:29.240
I'll administer the punishment.

00:38:30.641 --> 00:38:32.143
I look forward to working with you.

00:38:32.276 --> 00:38:33.444
Wataru Miyake.

00:38:33.611 --> 00:38:35.713
I wonder if Ms. Kume is married.

00:38:35.880 --> 00:38:36.881
How is Riko?

00:38:36.981 --> 00:38:38.215
What if something's happened?

00:38:38.349 --> 00:38:41.686
I want them to truly pay
for their sins.

00:38:41.786 --> 00:38:43.788
