Hey, when I was paying for this today,

00:00:08.680 --> 00:00:11.516
the cashier asked
how many spoons I needed,

00:00:12.717 --> 00:00:15.286
and without thinking,
I blurted out, "Two, please."

00:00:16.187 --> 00:00:18.423
Why can't I just be honest about it, huh?

00:00:20.358 --> 00:00:21.993
I mean, I'm fine eating alone.

00:00:22.060 --> 00:00:23.228
VANILLA ICE CREAM

00:00:23.294 --> 00:00:24.562
I may sound like

00:00:25.196 --> 00:00:28.566
I'm putting up a strong front,
but I'm really fine.

00:00:28.633 --> 00:00:31.769
Like, if this were the rest of my life,
I’d be satisfied. Don't you agree?

00:00:35.140 --> 00:00:36.141
Right?

00:00:40.078 --> 00:00:41.112
It's fine.

00:00:41.679 --> 00:00:44.449
I can’t have everything to myself
if I'm not alone…

OUR HAPPY COUPLES STORIES

00:00:49.854 --> 00:00:50.955
Are you Mr. Hatano?

00:00:51.022 --> 00:00:51.856
Yes.

00:00:52.423 --> 00:00:54.058
I’m Momose, and I’ll be assisting you.

00:00:54.993 --> 00:00:56.294
First, this gentleman here.

00:00:56.861 --> 00:00:59.564
He works at the city hall
and is 40 years old.

00:00:59.631 --> 00:01:02.367
He’s looking for a partner who enjoys

00:01:02.433 --> 00:01:04.402
traveling overseas every year.

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:08.606
And this gentleman is a French chef,
51 years old.

00:01:08.673 --> 00:01:11.943
He’s a huge music fan, and it seems
both of you have shared interests.

00:01:12.443 --> 00:01:14.846
Next is a dancer.

00:01:14.913 --> 00:01:18.016
He's 39 years old. He loves fishing…

00:01:18.082 --> 00:01:19.484
Did something catch your eye?

00:01:20.051 --> 00:01:23.087
No, I just happened to notice
how careful you are.

00:01:23.154 --> 00:01:24.789
Like with their faces.

00:01:24.856 --> 00:01:28.726
Details are shown
only after official enrollment.

00:01:29.294 --> 00:01:33.064
Rest assured, we take privacy
very seriously.

00:01:33.131 --> 00:01:37.168
After all, we’re the industry’s
leading partner agency for gay men.

00:01:38.136 --> 00:01:39.137
I see.

00:01:39.204 --> 00:01:40.772
Would you like to see more?

00:01:40.838 --> 00:01:42.840
Maybe tell me your preferences?

00:01:42.907 --> 00:01:46.144
For instance, body type.
Do you prefer slim or muscular?

00:01:46.211 --> 00:01:49.447
What about relationship style?
Wanting to be spoiled or vice versa.

00:01:49.514 --> 00:01:50.982
Nothing at all?

00:01:53.318 --> 00:01:54.185
Let me think…

00:01:58.356 --> 00:02:01.759
-Someone to eat ice cream with.
-Pardon?

00:02:01.826 --> 00:02:05.230
You know those giant
family-sized tubs of ice cream?

00:02:05.296 --> 00:02:06.531
Oh, that!

00:02:06.598 --> 00:02:10.401
The kind American kids eat
straight out of while watching movies.

00:02:11.169 --> 00:02:12.971
I bought one the other day.

00:02:13.538 --> 00:02:15.406
But I couldn't finish it.

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:18.710
That's when it hit me.

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:22.413
Wow, I really am alone.

00:02:23.881 --> 00:02:25.216
So, if I had to name a preference…

00:02:25.283 --> 00:02:28.620
I guess I'd like someone
who’d eat ice cream with me.

00:02:28.686 --> 00:02:29.520
That’s sweet.

00:02:29.587 --> 00:02:31.422
A partner to share a giant ice cream with.

00:02:31.489 --> 00:02:33.524
-But…
-But?

00:02:34.025 --> 00:02:37.662
I don't know. It's starting
to feel ridiculous.

00:02:37.729 --> 00:02:40.598
Who would take a middle-aged
gay man's words like that seriously?

00:02:40.665 --> 00:02:42.166
Even I think so, hearing myself.

00:02:42.233 --> 00:02:43.268
No, not at all!

00:02:43.334 --> 00:02:44.769
Don’t worry about it.

00:02:44.836 --> 00:02:47.939
I’ll keep working away at that ice cream
on my own. Sorry about this.

00:02:48.573 --> 00:02:50.475
-Mr. Hatano!
-Y-Yes?

00:02:50.541 --> 00:02:54.112
-Love and revolution.
-What?

00:02:54.178 --> 00:02:58.583
"Man was born for love and revolution."

00:03:01.519 --> 00:03:02.954
It's a quote by Dazai.

00:03:04.355 --> 00:03:05.189
Dazai?

00:03:05.256 --> 00:03:08.593
Please consider joining us.

00:03:09.661 --> 00:03:10.662
NAKAYOSHI PLAZA

00:03:13.865 --> 00:03:17.068
TRY FEEDING THE ANIMALS!

00:03:17.835 --> 00:03:20.071
So cute!

00:03:20.638 --> 00:03:22.640
They had a bad reaction to the medicine,

00:03:22.707 --> 00:03:24.275
and they threw up twice yesterday.

00:03:24.342 --> 00:03:26.744
-Really?
-Once at 1 a.m. and again at 3 a.m.

00:03:26.811 --> 00:03:27.679
Oh my.

00:03:29.614 --> 00:03:30.448
Huh?

00:03:31.783 --> 00:03:32.750
What?

00:03:32.817 --> 00:03:35.320
Oh dear…

00:03:40.291 --> 00:03:41.292
Hey there.

00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:44.395
Abandoning a cutie like this?

00:03:44.462 --> 00:03:47.131
Even Chan and Chasu would get mad,
am I right?

00:03:47.198 --> 00:03:48.466
What?

00:03:48.533 --> 00:03:51.602
At this rate, your apartment is going
to become a zoo, Hatano.

00:03:51.669 --> 00:03:52.837
-Wait…
-What?

00:03:52.904 --> 00:03:55.373
These two were abandoned,
and you took them in, Mr. Hatano?

00:03:55.440 --> 00:03:57.442
Yes, and a turtle as well.

00:03:57.508 --> 00:03:58.943
Wow.

00:03:59.811 --> 00:04:02.313
I can’t really take in any more, though.

00:04:02.380 --> 00:04:05.083
My place doesn’t even allow pets.

00:04:05.149 --> 00:04:06.050
Really?

00:04:06.117 --> 00:04:08.586
Yeah, but it seems to be fine so far.

00:04:08.653 --> 00:04:11.255
Hey, maybe we should put up a sign.

00:04:11.322 --> 00:04:13.725
"No dumping animals here!"

00:04:13.791 --> 00:04:14.759
Right.

00:04:14.826 --> 00:04:18.730
Okay, be nice, alright? We’re all going
to be living together now.

00:04:19.330 --> 00:04:20.932
Let's all get along, okay?

00:04:22.700 --> 00:04:23.668
Whoa, that was close.

00:04:28.806 --> 00:04:29.807
It's loose here.

00:04:32.377 --> 00:04:33.878
-Um…
-Yes?

00:04:33.945 --> 00:04:35.179
Use this if you'd like.

00:04:38.549 --> 00:04:40.017
Thank you.

00:04:48.092 --> 00:04:49.794
‎I reserved the cake,

00:04:50.495 --> 00:04:52.296
reserved the goods,

00:04:52.363 --> 00:04:54.932
and reserved the book.

00:04:56.534 --> 00:04:57.835
I'm so excited.

00:05:05.176 --> 00:05:08.646
RESERVATION SLIP

00:05:08.713 --> 00:05:11.549
-Sorry about that.
-Oh, no.

00:05:12.450 --> 00:05:13.351
Thank you.

00:05:14.519 --> 00:05:17.221
You reserved all of that?

00:05:18.022 --> 00:05:19.824
Yes, for books, games,
and stuff like that.

00:05:19.891 --> 00:05:22.593
This one here is for a Christmas cake.

00:05:22.660 --> 00:05:25.830
Making a reservation is like giving myself
something to look forward to.

00:05:25.897 --> 00:05:28.699
I'd then stare at the reservation slips
and smile to myself.

00:05:29.767 --> 00:05:31.068
Today I placed an order for osechi.

00:05:31.636 --> 00:05:32.937
Osechi? Amazing!

00:05:34.472 --> 00:05:36.107
Sorry for rambling.

00:05:36.808 --> 00:05:38.176
No, I'm the one who asked.

00:05:42.113 --> 00:05:44.582
You know, that idea of yours
is really nice.

00:05:45.216 --> 00:05:47.118
I recommend it.

00:05:57.395 --> 00:05:59.096
Can it be fixed?

00:05:59.163 --> 00:05:59.997
Yes.

00:06:02.166 --> 00:06:05.837
This part was coming loose,
so I'm bracing it with a clamp.

00:06:06.604 --> 00:06:08.005
What's that?

00:06:08.072 --> 00:06:09.073
This.

00:06:09.841 --> 00:06:11.108
With this…

00:06:12.176 --> 00:06:13.110
There we go.

00:06:13.744 --> 00:06:14.579
Solid.

00:06:18.850 --> 00:06:21.419
Oh, and this. What should I do about it?

00:06:23.521 --> 00:06:25.056
You can throw it out.

00:06:25.122 --> 00:06:26.557
Alright.

00:06:27.225 --> 00:06:28.059
Well then.

00:06:28.960 --> 00:06:30.294
Thanks again.

00:06:39.337 --> 00:06:41.405
HUSBAND-TO-BE: RYOTA YOSHIDA

00:06:41.472 --> 00:06:43.674
HUSBAND-TO-BE: SAKU SAKUTA

00:06:43.741 --> 00:06:45.009
Husband?

00:06:53.651 --> 00:06:57.388
The guy earlier was probably gay as well,
just like me.

00:06:59.090 --> 00:07:00.658
You know, right?

00:07:00.725 --> 00:07:03.794
We can’t file marriage registration forms.

00:07:03.861 --> 00:07:04.929
But still…

00:07:06.197 --> 00:07:07.932
he must’ve wanted to.

00:07:07.999 --> 00:07:09.934
‎SAKU SAKUTA

00:07:10.001 --> 00:07:11.035
Let's have dinner.

00:07:13.538 --> 00:07:14.572
Important?

00:07:14.639 --> 00:07:15.473
IMPORTANT

00:07:18.309 --> 00:07:19.744
EVICTION NOTICE

00:07:19.810 --> 00:07:22.914
"This apartment is strictly no-pets.
Please vacate immediately."

00:07:26.984 --> 00:07:27.852
Well, guys…

00:07:30.388 --> 00:07:31.522
looks like we’re moving.

00:07:38.129 --> 00:07:39.063
You hear me?

00:07:39.564 --> 00:07:42.533
You're coming to school today, right?

00:07:42.600 --> 00:07:43.968
Yes.

00:07:44.035 --> 00:07:45.102
I'll be waiting.

00:07:45.736 --> 00:07:48.639
And about the parent-teacher conference,
can your dad--

00:07:49.140 --> 00:07:51.008
He can’t take off work.

00:07:51.075 --> 00:07:53.878
He said he’ll think about the date.

00:07:53.945 --> 00:07:56.981
But graduation’s only half a year away.

00:07:57.048 --> 00:08:00.585
I'd like to contact your dad myself.
Can you give me his number later?

00:08:03.220 --> 00:08:04.188
Can you hear me?

00:08:05.389 --> 00:08:06.223
Okay.

00:08:06.924 --> 00:08:07.758
Will do.

00:08:07.825 --> 00:08:10.895
Also, can you submit
your career sheet today?

00:08:11.395 --> 00:08:12.396
Yes.

00:08:12.463 --> 00:08:13.664
Alright, I’ll be waiti--

00:08:19.136 --> 00:08:20.705
-Pets weren't allowed?
-Yeah.

00:08:21.405 --> 00:08:24.075
What were you thinking?

00:08:24.141 --> 00:08:27.311
You should’ve called us sooner.

00:08:27.378 --> 00:08:29.947
Then we could’ve found something better.

00:08:30.781 --> 00:08:33.918
I mean, it’s close to work and cheap too.

00:08:33.985 --> 00:08:36.420
Why don’t you just buy a place?

00:08:37.188 --> 00:08:38.255
Huh? Why?

00:08:38.322 --> 00:08:39.357
Well,

00:08:39.423 --> 00:08:42.226
this time, you got lucky finding one
that fits your circumstances.

00:08:42.293 --> 00:08:44.762
But who knows if you can keep
renting there forever?

00:08:44.829 --> 00:08:47.632
As you get older, renting a new place

00:08:47.698 --> 00:08:49.200
becomes much harder.

00:08:49.266 --> 00:08:50.334
I know.

00:08:50.401 --> 00:08:51.802
Even more so for a loner.

00:08:51.869 --> 00:08:53.404
Yeah, yeah.

00:08:53.471 --> 00:08:55.406
That's exactly why I'm telling you to buy.

00:08:56.107 --> 00:08:58.342
But I don’t have that much money.

00:08:58.409 --> 00:09:01.278
That’s what loans are for.

00:09:01.345 --> 00:09:04.448
Even if I were to take out a loan now,

00:09:04.515 --> 00:09:06.150
a 35-year house loan…

00:09:07.818 --> 00:09:09.086
Is that even possible?

00:09:09.654 --> 00:09:12.023
-Who knows?
-Oh, come on.

00:09:14.659 --> 00:09:15.626
It should be here…

00:09:16.193 --> 00:09:18.262
-I'll go check.
-Okay.

00:09:20.264 --> 00:09:22.299
-Welcome! This way.
-Oh.

00:09:22.366 --> 00:09:23.200
Got it.

00:09:30.341 --> 00:09:35.012
Keep going, keep going, keep going.
Okay, stop!

00:09:37.314 --> 00:09:39.583
Nice to meet you. Just the other day,

00:09:39.650 --> 00:09:41.952
I spoke with you on the phone.

00:09:42.953 --> 00:09:45.156
I'm from Hibino Real Estate.
My name is Okabe.

00:09:46.590 --> 00:09:49.427
Nice to meet you too.
I’m Inokashira, the landlady.

00:09:51.529 --> 00:09:52.496
Oh, this is…

00:09:52.563 --> 00:09:55.166
I'll be in your care from today onward.

00:09:55.232 --> 00:09:57.101
I'm Hatano. Nice to meet you.

00:09:57.168 --> 00:09:58.135
This way, please.

00:09:58.202 --> 00:09:59.770
Thank you.

00:09:59.837 --> 00:10:01.505
Let's go. Come on.

00:10:02.073 --> 00:10:03.074
Welcome.

00:10:04.175 --> 00:10:06.444
This place is huge! Awesome!

00:10:06.510 --> 00:10:08.479
It's pretty old though.

00:10:08.546 --> 00:10:09.613
Oh, no.

00:10:09.680 --> 00:10:11.816
It’s far from the station too.

00:10:11.882 --> 00:10:15.453
Since only one room is occupied,
it’s pretty much an empty house.

00:10:15.519 --> 00:10:18.589
But you coming in will liven it up a bit.
This is your unit, Hatano.

00:10:18.656 --> 00:10:19.523
Okay.

00:10:19.590 --> 00:10:21.959
See? It's a dump, right?

00:10:22.026 --> 00:10:24.462
So, don't mind it, pups.

00:10:24.528 --> 00:10:26.564
Oh, no. It's cozy.

00:10:26.630 --> 00:10:28.132
Really? Then that's great.

00:10:28.199 --> 00:10:30.901
So, Ms. Inokashira,
about the contract paperwork…

00:10:30.968 --> 00:10:33.537
Oh, yes. Let's go to my room.

00:10:33.604 --> 00:10:34.505
Okay.

00:10:34.572 --> 00:10:35.840
Thank you.

00:10:35.906 --> 00:10:37.508
It's my pleasure.

00:10:38.275 --> 00:10:39.543
Well, guys,

00:10:40.211 --> 00:10:43.314
this is our new home.

00:10:43.380 --> 00:10:44.215
A round of applause!

00:10:52.857 --> 00:10:53.858
Dogs?

00:11:01.232 --> 00:11:02.066
Hello.

00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:03.834
Hi.

00:11:03.901 --> 00:11:06.070
I just moved in. I'm Hatano.

00:11:06.137 --> 00:11:08.105
-I'm Kusunoki.
-Nice to meet you.

00:11:08.873 --> 00:11:09.940
-Ah.
-What?

00:11:10.808 --> 00:11:11.909
Dogs.

00:11:13.477 --> 00:11:16.147
-Did they scare you? I'm sorry.
-Oh, no.

00:11:16.947 --> 00:11:20.017
The dogs are with me.
I hope you don't mind.

00:11:20.084 --> 00:11:21.152
What are you doing?

00:11:21.218 --> 00:11:23.053
Just doing a little rearranging.

00:11:23.120 --> 00:11:25.956
Um, are your parents around?

00:11:26.023 --> 00:11:27.591
-I want to say hel--
-They're not!

00:11:27.658 --> 00:11:28.559
Oh, okay.

00:11:29.493 --> 00:11:30.427
For now, at least.

00:11:32.029 --> 00:11:34.064
Another time then.

00:11:45.843 --> 00:11:46.877
Dang it.

00:11:50.681 --> 00:11:52.183
Mr. Sakuta.

00:11:53.217 --> 00:11:54.051
Kusunoki.

00:11:54.885 --> 00:11:55.853
You want to use this?

00:11:57.087 --> 00:11:58.155
Thanks.

00:12:00.224 --> 00:12:01.392
Like I said earlier,

00:12:01.458 --> 00:12:03.794
don’t forget
about the parent-teacher meeting.

00:12:04.361 --> 00:12:05.362
Okay.

00:12:07.398 --> 00:12:09.533
And your career sheet too, later…

00:12:11.535 --> 00:12:12.770
I’ll hand it in now.

00:12:12.837 --> 00:12:15.539
Now?

00:12:15.606 --> 00:12:16.473
Got it.

00:12:19.376 --> 00:12:20.744
You're heading home already?

00:12:21.679 --> 00:12:23.581
I just came to turn that in.

00:12:24.582 --> 00:12:27.751
THIS IS THE REAR GATE. PLEASE USE
MAIN ENTRANCE. NO UNAUTHORIZED VEHICLES

00:12:27.818 --> 00:12:29.987
CAREER SHEET

00:12:32.089 --> 00:12:33.591
I can't quite see it.

00:12:33.657 --> 00:12:36.627
A100-yen coin really rolled right in!

00:12:36.694 --> 00:12:38.896
-You need to go deeper.
-Oh, is that it?

00:12:38.963 --> 00:12:40.598
Where's his hair swirl? I can't see it.

00:12:40.664 --> 00:12:42.700
-Isn't it here?
-You're right.

00:12:42.766 --> 00:12:46.370
I never knew adults have hair swirls too.
First time I’ve seen one.

00:12:46.437 --> 00:12:47.671
We wouldn't go out of our way to look.

00:12:47.738 --> 00:12:48.772
Yeah.

00:12:48.839 --> 00:12:49.707
There's nothing!

00:12:51.775 --> 00:12:53.644
How scary!

00:12:54.211 --> 00:12:56.480
Hurry and run!

00:12:57.481 --> 00:12:59.149
Hurry! Let's go!

00:13:06.624 --> 00:13:07.625
DINNER SET
STARTING FROM 1,500 YEN

00:13:12.763 --> 00:13:14.598
NO LONGER HUMAN. DON'T ABANDON YOUR PETS

00:13:14.665 --> 00:13:16.033
Words of Dazai?

00:13:18.035 --> 00:13:19.003
Alrighty.

00:13:20.070 --> 00:13:21.005
Here you go.

00:13:21.071 --> 00:13:22.273
I'll leave the feed here.

00:13:22.339 --> 00:13:23.908
Thank you for your work.

00:13:32.082 --> 00:13:33.083
Hello there.

00:13:35.119 --> 00:13:35.953
You're the clamp guy.

00:13:36.787 --> 00:13:37.621
Oh.

00:13:38.522 --> 00:13:39.690
My name is Hatano.

00:13:39.757 --> 00:13:40.958
I'm Sakuta.

00:13:42.026 --> 00:13:43.627
The bench seems fine now.

00:13:43.694 --> 00:13:45.996
Yes.

00:13:46.063 --> 00:13:47.197
That's great.

00:13:51.035 --> 00:13:52.870
Is there something on my face?

00:13:52.937 --> 00:13:55.239
It’s more your neck than your face.

00:13:57.508 --> 00:13:58.642
Oh God.

00:14:01.011 --> 00:14:02.746
Please have a seat.

00:14:03.514 --> 00:14:05.215
Oh, thank you.

00:14:05.783 --> 00:14:07.718
Actually, I've been spending
the night in my car.

00:14:07.785 --> 00:14:08.686
What?

00:14:08.752 --> 00:14:10.754
I have it parked in the lot over there.

00:14:11.889 --> 00:14:13.424
Are you traveling or something?

00:14:14.024 --> 00:14:15.826
That'd be cool,

00:14:15.893 --> 00:14:18.395
-but I don't have a place right now.
-What?

00:14:18.462 --> 00:14:21.098
I broke up with my partner,
ended our cohabitation,

00:14:21.165 --> 00:14:23.901
and ran off before finding a new place.
It’s a pretty common trope.

00:14:25.936 --> 00:14:27.338
So, that's how it is.

00:14:27.404 --> 00:14:28.605
Yeah.

00:14:28.672 --> 00:14:29.773
Then, that paper…

00:14:30.541 --> 00:14:31.575
What paper?

00:14:32.109 --> 00:14:34.478
The one you gave me to fix the bench.

00:14:36.647 --> 00:14:37.748
Sorry about that.

00:14:37.815 --> 00:14:40.084
I opened it up and took a look. Sorry.

00:14:40.150 --> 00:14:42.286
Right.

00:14:42.353 --> 00:14:43.921
Of course you'd look at it.

00:14:43.988 --> 00:14:44.822
I should be saying sorry.

00:14:44.888 --> 00:14:46.190
Oh, no. Not at all.

00:14:46.256 --> 00:14:48.425
One wouldn't expect
a marriage registration, right?

00:14:48.993 --> 00:14:49.927
Must’ve shocked you.

00:14:50.694 --> 00:14:52.363
Yeah, quite a bit.

00:14:52.429 --> 00:14:55.232
As you saw, I'm gay.

00:15:00.070 --> 00:15:01.538
Don't worry.

00:15:02.306 --> 00:15:03.507
About what?

00:15:05.542 --> 00:15:08.645
I'm the same as well.

00:15:09.413 --> 00:15:11.815
Oh, really? Oh, I see.

00:15:11.882 --> 00:15:13.817
But no need to worry about it.

00:15:13.884 --> 00:15:16.153
I’m not really hiding it.

00:15:16.887 --> 00:15:18.188
Is that so?

00:15:18.255 --> 00:15:21.925
I'm not exactly open about it,
but if people ask, I'd tell them.

00:15:24.795 --> 00:15:28.065
Even so, it’s not easy
to throw away that paper.

00:15:28.132 --> 00:15:29.867
Yeah.

00:15:29.933 --> 00:15:33.437
I had a hard time throwing it away myself.
I'm glad you did it for me.

00:15:35.339 --> 00:15:36.573
Wasn’t that also something

00:15:37.307 --> 00:15:39.076
similar to those reservation slips,

00:15:39.143 --> 00:15:41.812
and you looked forward to it?

00:15:42.913 --> 00:15:46.083
Not really. It didn’t mean anything.

00:15:46.150 --> 00:15:48.452
We can’t submit it anyway. It's pointless.

00:15:50.354 --> 00:15:51.188
Pointless?

00:15:51.755 --> 00:15:54.458
We can't get married anyway.
There's no point.

00:15:57.761 --> 00:15:58.862
You know,

00:15:59.797 --> 00:16:01.732
I went to a marriage consultation agency
the other day.

00:16:01.799 --> 00:16:02.699
Even though you can't marry?

00:16:02.766 --> 00:16:05.302
Yeah, but…

00:16:05.869 --> 00:16:07.137
there’s one for people like us.

00:16:08.338 --> 00:16:09.573
I went out of curiosity.

00:16:09.640 --> 00:16:12.509
Felt kind of excited, honestly.

00:16:13.544 --> 00:16:16.313
But every profile photo

00:16:16.380 --> 00:16:18.215
was pixelated.

00:16:18.949 --> 00:16:20.984
Total privacy protection.

00:16:21.552 --> 00:16:23.420
Which is nice, of course.

00:16:25.055 --> 00:16:25.923
But it felt like…

00:16:27.357 --> 00:16:29.726
in the end, people like us
are something to be censored.

00:16:30.294 --> 00:16:32.729
Hidden. That's just how

00:16:34.264 --> 00:16:36.133
we're forced to live our lives, I guess.

00:16:38.836 --> 00:16:40.938
Well, what I'm trying to say

00:16:41.905 --> 00:16:42.840
is, um…

00:16:45.342 --> 00:16:46.610
What are we supposed to do?

00:16:46.677 --> 00:16:49.713
Let's just drop this discussion.
It's pointless.

00:16:50.280 --> 00:16:51.381
Well then.

00:17:06.063 --> 00:17:08.065
You’ve got three hair swirls.

00:17:08.132 --> 00:17:09.366
No way!

00:17:09.433 --> 00:17:10.267
Aren't there five?

00:17:10.334 --> 00:17:12.069
You can't see it yourself, right?

00:17:12.136 --> 00:17:13.203
Hurry and take a picture.

00:17:13.270 --> 00:17:14.171
Okay.

00:17:16.340 --> 00:17:17.307
Here you go.

00:17:17.808 --> 00:17:18.642
Thanks.

00:17:18.709 --> 00:17:20.777
You can see it clearly.

00:17:21.678 --> 00:17:23.747
Hey, what's the meaning of this?

00:17:23.814 --> 00:17:25.082
Your hair swirl is beautiful!

00:17:25.149 --> 00:17:26.049
It is!

00:17:26.116 --> 00:17:27.784
Do you want anything?

00:17:28.919 --> 00:17:32.322
You were collecting coins yesterday,
weren’t you? Anything you want?

00:17:32.389 --> 00:17:35.492
I work with a group called Nikomado.

00:17:35.559 --> 00:17:38.162
We listen to people’s problems,
help them out--

00:17:38.228 --> 00:17:39.596
You're being a creep!

00:17:40.797 --> 00:17:42.966
You see,
I just want to have a talk with you.

00:17:43.033 --> 00:17:43.867
Get lost!

00:17:44.535 --> 00:17:46.136
-No, wait!
-We said get lost!

00:17:46.203 --> 00:17:47.538
Go away!

00:17:47.604 --> 00:17:50.073
-Let go of me!
-Get out of here!

00:17:55.612 --> 00:17:58.382
She refused to give us
her parents’ contact information.

00:17:58.448 --> 00:18:01.885
The only number
she finally gave us was yours.

00:18:02.786 --> 00:18:04.621
I'm really sorry about this.

00:18:04.688 --> 00:18:06.890
Please wait here.

00:18:06.957 --> 00:18:08.125
Can't you contact them?

00:18:08.192 --> 00:18:11.595
Like I said, both my mom and dad
are very nice people.

00:18:11.662 --> 00:18:13.730
They really care about me, and that’s why

00:18:13.797 --> 00:18:15.232
I don’t want to call them.

00:18:15.832 --> 00:18:17.634
I don’t want to bother them
during their trip.

00:18:18.902 --> 00:18:20.704
They'll be back tomorrow.

00:18:20.771 --> 00:18:21.939
I'm totally fine.

00:18:24.908 --> 00:18:26.043
Please come in.

00:18:26.109 --> 00:18:27.277
Please excuse me.

00:18:35.886 --> 00:18:37.487
I'm sorry.

00:18:38.922 --> 00:18:41.992
What time does your dad usually come home?

00:18:43.393 --> 00:18:44.428
It varies.

00:18:44.494 --> 00:18:47.130
-What about this Monday?
-What?

00:18:47.698 --> 00:18:50.867
For the parent-teacher meeting,
I’ll come to your house.

00:18:52.269 --> 00:18:53.370
Monday's not good…

00:18:53.437 --> 00:18:55.772
Then what about Tuesday or Wednesday?

00:18:56.773 --> 00:18:58.041
I'm not sure.

00:18:58.108 --> 00:19:01.211
How about Saturday then?
Maybe around 5:30 p.m.

00:19:05.549 --> 00:19:06.950
Okay.

00:19:11.221 --> 00:19:13.924
Good boy… Wait up!

00:19:14.992 --> 00:19:15.892
Oh, good evening.

00:19:16.526 --> 00:19:17.861
What are you doing?

00:19:17.928 --> 00:19:20.897
Figured I'd bathe them,
given how huge the yard is.

00:19:21.965 --> 00:19:22.966
Huh?

00:19:24.534 --> 00:19:26.169
Rearranging stuff again?

00:19:26.236 --> 00:19:27.704
Yeah, something like that.

00:19:29.139 --> 00:19:30.841
Good boy…

00:19:35.979 --> 00:19:37.681
Is this yours too, Mr. Hatano?

00:19:38.849 --> 00:19:42.352
Yeah, I just started keeping it recently.

00:19:42.419 --> 00:19:44.988
What's its name?

00:19:46.390 --> 00:19:48.258
-Good question.
-Huh?

00:19:48.892 --> 00:19:51.495
It was abandoned. Like these two.

00:20:20.290 --> 00:20:21.792
Oh! Let's go.

00:20:31.802 --> 00:20:33.470
NO JUNK MAIL, PLEASE

00:20:34.671 --> 00:20:36.406
-Hey, you!
-Yes?

00:20:36.473 --> 00:20:37.574
You put something in, yes?

00:20:37.641 --> 00:20:38.475
What?

00:20:39.042 --> 00:20:40.410
Look what's written here.

00:20:40.477 --> 00:20:43.246
-No, I… It's not--
-Take it back.

00:20:43.313 --> 00:20:45.215
-But…
-See?

00:20:46.383 --> 00:20:48.452
Huh?

00:20:48.518 --> 00:20:51.154
-Um…
-What's the meaning of this?

00:20:54.224 --> 00:20:55.992
You always liked strawberries, right?

00:20:56.059 --> 00:20:58.195
No. You must be confusing me
with your new daughter.

00:21:00.664 --> 00:21:03.367
Come on. Don't say that.

00:21:05.702 --> 00:21:07.437
So, what did you want to talk about today?

00:21:09.606 --> 00:21:10.574
I've got a favor to ask.

00:21:11.308 --> 00:21:12.676
Did Mom call you?

00:21:12.743 --> 00:21:13.777
It's not that.

00:21:14.411 --> 00:21:15.579
Then, what is it?

00:21:16.413 --> 00:21:17.714
There’s a parent-teacher meeting.

00:21:18.448 --> 00:21:19.316
What?

00:21:20.417 --> 00:21:21.251
So,

00:21:21.785 --> 00:21:23.487
I want you to come.

00:21:23.553 --> 00:21:26.790
Me? But I don’t know anything. No way.

00:21:26.857 --> 00:21:28.558
Just bluff your way through.

00:21:28.625 --> 00:21:30.494
There's no way I'm going to pull it off.

00:21:34.364 --> 00:21:36.933
Right. You’ve got your new family
to worry about, Mr. Ichigaya.

00:21:37.501 --> 00:21:40.537
Come on. Don’t be like that.

00:21:41.805 --> 00:21:44.741
Welcome! This way, please.

00:21:47.577 --> 00:21:50.180
Two guys coming to eat crepes?

00:21:51.915 --> 00:21:55.152
He loved these banana crepes.

00:21:56.586 --> 00:22:00.056
Can’t believe it ended up under a bench.
So, why’d you bring this?

00:22:00.657 --> 00:22:01.658
What do you want?

00:22:04.728 --> 00:22:07.297
I'm… the same kind.

00:22:08.131 --> 00:22:09.232
Sorry, what?

00:22:10.500 --> 00:22:12.502
I'm saying I’m gay too.

00:22:13.937 --> 00:22:15.138
Did he say "gay"?

00:22:16.206 --> 00:22:17.741
Phew.

00:22:17.808 --> 00:22:19.643
Here I thought you were here
to blackmail me.

00:22:19.709 --> 00:22:21.178
Oh, no.

00:22:21.711 --> 00:22:24.481
I just couldn’t bring myself
to throw it away.

00:22:26.283 --> 00:22:29.453
Sakuta said that this form was pointless.

00:22:29.519 --> 00:22:31.655
MARRIAGE REGISTRATION FORM

00:22:31.721 --> 00:22:33.690
Did something happen between you two?

00:22:33.757 --> 00:22:35.225
Nothing, really.

00:22:35.792 --> 00:22:39.329
It’s just that people like us,
we don’t have a clear goal, right?

00:22:40.130 --> 00:22:42.599
Marriage, kids, etc.

00:22:42.666 --> 00:22:44.534
It’s all kind of impossible.

00:22:44.601 --> 00:22:45.435
Right.

00:22:46.069 --> 00:22:49.673
So, we date, break up, get back together,
and the cycle repeats.

00:22:50.173 --> 00:22:53.176
He must've hated that.

00:22:53.243 --> 00:22:56.046
So, one day he said, ‘We can’t turn it in,

00:22:56.112 --> 00:22:58.281
but let’s try filling out
a marriage registration form."

00:22:58.348 --> 00:22:59.282
HUSBAND-TO-BE: SAKU SAKUTA

00:22:59.349 --> 00:23:02.953
But after we wrote it,

00:23:03.019 --> 00:23:05.555
he was like, "It doesn’t mean
anything, does it?"

00:23:05.622 --> 00:23:09.693
Society doesn’t recognize it,
and nobody celebrates it.

00:23:09.759 --> 00:23:13.230
He said a relationship like that
is not worth keeping.

00:23:14.831 --> 00:23:17.000
So, I just said, "Guess that’s it, then.

00:23:17.067 --> 00:23:18.435
Let’s break up."

00:23:18.502 --> 00:23:19.836
What else could I say?

00:23:21.505 --> 00:23:22.639
Is that a couple’s ring

00:23:23.440 --> 00:23:24.641
with Sakuta?

00:23:24.708 --> 00:23:26.042
Oh, no.

00:23:26.109 --> 00:23:28.545
I wear this on my own.

00:23:28.612 --> 00:23:29.713
It’s fake.

00:23:30.780 --> 00:23:31.615
Huh?

00:23:33.517 --> 00:23:34.351
"Got a girlfriend yet?"

00:23:35.218 --> 00:23:36.152
"When are you getting married?"

00:23:37.053 --> 00:23:38.488
"Aren’t you too old to be single?"

00:23:39.055 --> 00:23:40.557
Saves me from that kind of hassle.

00:23:41.124 --> 00:23:42.859
I’d rather not explain myself.

00:23:43.426 --> 00:23:45.061
I get that.

00:23:46.997 --> 00:23:48.265
But still, I think

00:23:49.232 --> 00:23:51.067
there was more you could’ve done.

00:23:51.635 --> 00:23:52.802
What?

00:23:52.869 --> 00:23:55.005
"Let’s be together
until we can turn this in."

00:23:55.071 --> 00:23:57.507
Saying stuff like that.

00:23:57.574 --> 00:23:59.409
Or even, "Let’s at least
wear wedding rings

00:23:59.476 --> 00:24:01.912
as a sign of our bond."

00:24:01.978 --> 00:24:03.280
To Sakuta,

00:24:03.346 --> 00:24:05.882
there had to be something
you could’ve done or given him.

00:24:05.949 --> 00:24:08.251
Listen, that’s between me and Saku.

00:24:08.318 --> 00:24:11.421
I mean, wearing a ring
by yourself like that

00:24:11.488 --> 00:24:12.856
is a little insensitive, no?

00:24:12.923 --> 00:24:14.791
I said that is between me and him.

00:24:14.858 --> 00:24:16.526
No, it's my problem too!

00:24:16.593 --> 00:24:18.728
-What?
-The love between people like us…

00:24:19.429 --> 00:24:20.864
I don’t want to believe it's pointless!

00:24:21.932 --> 00:24:23.066
Oh, sorry.

00:24:24.200 --> 00:24:25.802
Some kind of gay lovers’ spat?

00:24:26.770 --> 00:24:28.805
So, are you seeing anyone?

00:24:28.872 --> 00:24:29.906
No.

00:24:29.973 --> 00:24:31.708
Got someone you like?

00:24:31.775 --> 00:24:33.610
I'm not sure yet.

00:24:33.677 --> 00:24:34.911
Huh?

00:24:34.978 --> 00:24:36.680
But I do know

00:24:37.981 --> 00:24:40.250
-that I want to love someone openly.
-Hey, now…

00:24:40.817 --> 00:24:42.018
I wanna fall madly in love!

00:24:42.085 --> 00:24:43.720
-Lower your volume!
-Ah!

00:24:44.754 --> 00:24:47.057
People are staring.

00:24:52.128 --> 00:24:53.830
You know him?

00:24:54.598 --> 00:24:55.599
He’s from my apartment.

00:24:57.000 --> 00:24:59.769
What are you even talking about?
You’re too old for that.

00:24:59.836 --> 00:25:02.038
You’re right.
What the hell am I even saying?

00:25:03.273 --> 00:25:07.177
Um… Hey.

00:25:09.980 --> 00:25:12.449
Thanks for looking after my daughter.

00:25:12.515 --> 00:25:13.416
Hey!

00:25:14.551 --> 00:25:16.319
-You know him?
-No.

00:25:16.886 --> 00:25:18.288
-Let's leave already.
-Okay.

00:25:23.460 --> 00:25:24.327
Nice meeting you.

00:25:26.963 --> 00:25:30.300
Kinda feels like we just saw
something weird.

00:25:30.367 --> 00:25:32.035
It's not weird.

00:25:32.102 --> 00:25:35.171
Come on. You don’t get to see
that kind of thing often.

00:25:37.907 --> 00:25:38.742
I'm off.

00:25:43.046 --> 00:25:45.215
HAPPY STORE

00:25:47.684 --> 00:25:48.785
Earlier at the crepe place…

00:25:50.153 --> 00:25:51.421
you said you wanna fall madly in love.

00:25:51.488 --> 00:25:52.689
You heard that?

00:25:52.756 --> 00:25:54.524
Yes, loud and clear.

00:25:55.225 --> 00:25:57.961
Then, just leave me be, okay?

00:26:01.598 --> 00:26:02.832
Are you gay?

00:26:02.899 --> 00:26:04.434
Well, yeah.

00:26:05.135 --> 00:26:06.002
The person you were with too?

00:26:06.069 --> 00:26:07.604
I’m in no position to talk about others.

00:26:07.671 --> 00:26:10.040
So, it’s fine to talk about yourself then?

00:26:14.411 --> 00:26:16.146
You like men?

00:26:16.212 --> 00:26:17.180
I guess.

00:26:17.847 --> 00:26:20.517
-How do you know if he feels the same?
-Sometimes you can tell.

00:26:21.117 --> 00:26:22.552
Sometimes you can’t.

00:26:22.619 --> 00:26:23.553
Do you kiss?

00:26:23.620 --> 00:26:24.454
What?

00:26:24.521 --> 00:26:26.122
I said kiss. Do you usually kiss?

00:26:26.189 --> 00:26:27.090
Hey now…

00:26:27.157 --> 00:26:28.258
Well, answer me.

00:26:29.659 --> 00:26:34.297
Look, you wouldn't normally ask
other people that, would you?

00:26:34.898 --> 00:26:37.934
It's not good manners to ask questions
you wouldn't normally ask people.

00:26:40.670 --> 00:26:43.239
But this is my first time
meeting someone like that.

00:26:43.740 --> 00:26:45.375
It's probably not your first.

00:26:46.176 --> 00:26:48.812
They say there's about one or two
in every 100 people.

00:26:49.379 --> 00:26:51.147
I’m sure there are some
at your school too.

00:26:52.148 --> 00:26:54.651
You just don’t see them.

00:26:58.722 --> 00:26:59.823
FAMILY PACK ICE CREAM

00:26:59.889 --> 00:27:01.858
Want something?

00:27:03.660 --> 00:27:04.694
Since we’re here,

00:27:05.261 --> 00:27:06.496
pick whatever you like.

00:27:09.432 --> 00:27:11.167
-Then I'll have this.
-No mercy, huh?

00:27:12.669 --> 00:27:14.571
Oh, this one doesn't come with a discount.

00:27:15.872 --> 00:27:17.340
A hair swirl!

00:27:18.408 --> 00:27:19.843
What?

00:27:19.909 --> 00:27:22.779
Something you don’t notice,
but it’s there.

00:27:24.347 --> 00:27:25.215
Hair swirl, huh?

00:27:26.850 --> 00:27:27.851
Sorry.

00:27:29.385 --> 00:27:31.154
For what?

00:27:31.221 --> 00:27:34.324
The other day, I hated it
when you assumed I had parents.

00:27:34.390 --> 00:27:36.025
But I said something similar to you.

00:27:37.627 --> 00:27:39.763
Wait. You don't have parents?

00:27:39.829 --> 00:27:40.663
No.

00:27:42.932 --> 00:27:45.769
But the person you were with earlier…

00:27:45.835 --> 00:27:47.370
That was my former dad.

00:27:47.437 --> 00:27:49.839
My parents divorced. He has a new family.

00:27:49.906 --> 00:27:52.509
My mom… Well, a lot happened.

00:27:54.110 --> 00:27:57.080
I’m sorry for assuming.

00:27:58.615 --> 00:27:59.783
Is being gay hard?

00:27:59.849 --> 00:28:00.717
Huh?

00:28:04.654 --> 00:28:06.122
What about you?

00:28:06.189 --> 00:28:07.557
Then, are you glad you’re gay?

00:28:10.794 --> 00:28:14.464
I want to believe I am.

00:28:15.565 --> 00:28:16.833
So, what do you do?

00:28:18.001 --> 00:28:18.868
What do you mean?

00:28:19.369 --> 00:28:21.271
How do you come
to feel good about being gay?

00:28:28.144 --> 00:28:29.612
Love and revolution?

00:28:36.052 --> 00:28:37.120
Good afternoon.

00:28:38.288 --> 00:28:40.790
So, you’re here today to complete
your membership paperwork?

00:28:40.857 --> 00:28:44.093
What if feelings alone aren’t enough?
What do we do then?

00:28:44.627 --> 00:28:46.963
-What?
-Here.

00:28:47.831 --> 00:28:50.233
We can’t legally marry,
so how can you call it a marriage agency?

00:28:51.267 --> 00:28:55.171
Here, if both partners have the intention
to marry, we acknowledge it as marriage.

00:28:55.238 --> 00:28:56.673
Is there any way to stay together,

00:28:57.307 --> 00:28:59.809
even if we can’t file
a marriage registration form?

00:29:04.047 --> 00:29:07.317
Have you heard of the term "family glue"?

00:29:07.383 --> 00:29:09.352
Like, "Children bring
the family together?"

00:29:09.419 --> 00:29:12.889
I think couples who last a long time
have something like that.

00:29:12.956 --> 00:29:16.993
It's hard to sustain it
based only on love or affection.

00:29:18.228 --> 00:29:19.262
The "glue"…

00:29:19.963 --> 00:29:23.466
-Well then, please fill out this form--
-Thank you.

00:29:25.068 --> 00:29:26.536
Thank you.

00:29:29.305 --> 00:29:32.375
BANANA

00:29:36.546 --> 00:29:39.349
RECEIPTS, BANK BOOK

00:29:41.384 --> 00:29:44.354
Today’s place to sleep

00:29:44.420 --> 00:29:47.457
Is on a park bench

00:29:48.024 --> 00:29:50.860
Sleeping in cramped spots

00:29:50.927 --> 00:29:54.063
Is what you're used to

00:29:54.898 --> 00:30:00.370
Tomorrow’s place will be in a car

00:30:00.937 --> 00:30:06.976
Fallen leaves will wrap you up

00:30:07.043 --> 00:30:10.680
Oh yeah

00:30:12.815 --> 00:30:18.021
No home, oh, no home

00:30:19.222 --> 00:30:24.427
The vast sky is your roof

00:30:25.161 --> 00:30:26.663
The day after tomorrow…

00:30:26.729 --> 00:30:29.465
I wonder if Hatano didn't have a home.

00:30:31.834 --> 00:30:33.369
Poor man.

00:30:34.370 --> 00:30:36.773
Your new home

00:30:38.041 --> 00:30:42.912
No home, oh, no home

00:30:43.646 --> 00:30:48.818
The vast sky is your roof

00:30:49.519 --> 00:30:54.424
The day after tomorrow
The day after tomo--

00:30:57.193 --> 00:30:58.728
I can hear it from all the way up.

00:30:58.795 --> 00:31:00.463
Oh, my bad.

00:31:00.530 --> 00:31:02.198
-What’s that song?
-Huh?

00:31:02.265 --> 00:31:03.232
The title of that song.

00:31:04.434 --> 00:31:06.769
I don't know. Maybe "No Home"?

00:31:09.339 --> 00:31:10.373
Um…

00:31:10.440 --> 00:31:11.274
Yes?

00:31:12.008 --> 00:31:14.544
On Saturday, around 5:30 p.m.
in the evening, will you be home?

00:31:15.144 --> 00:31:17.647
Yeah, I get off work
and come back by then. Why?

00:31:20.350 --> 00:31:21.351
Well…

00:31:23.152 --> 00:31:25.288
I want to see your parakeet.

00:31:26.289 --> 00:31:27.123
My parakeet?

00:31:27.690 --> 00:31:28.524
Yes.

00:31:29.492 --> 00:31:31.060
Then, it's settled.

00:31:38.701 --> 00:31:39.535
HIBINO REAL ESTATE CO., LTD.

00:31:39.602 --> 00:31:41.604
No home…

00:31:53.816 --> 00:31:55.184
Hello.

00:31:56.986 --> 00:31:58.021
Hello.

00:31:58.087 --> 00:31:59.956
You're always here, huh?

00:32:00.023 --> 00:32:01.457
Sakuta.

00:32:01.524 --> 00:32:02.492
Yes?

00:32:02.558 --> 00:32:03.393
Uh…

00:32:09.365 --> 00:32:11.234
What do you think about buying a house?

00:32:11.968 --> 00:32:13.102
What?

00:32:13.169 --> 00:32:14.003
Here.

00:32:15.638 --> 00:32:16.472
Please take it.

00:32:22.211 --> 00:32:23.212
INTRODUCING PAIR LOANS

00:32:23.780 --> 00:32:25.748
Wait. What is all this supposed to mean?

00:32:26.349 --> 00:32:28.785
Living out of your car seems tough.

00:32:29.352 --> 00:32:30.920
Well, that's true, but…

00:32:30.987 --> 00:32:33.289
-I've spoken to Yoshida as well.
-What?

00:32:33.356 --> 00:32:34.557
I've heard the circumstances.

00:32:34.624 --> 00:32:36.926
Huh? You went and met him?

00:32:36.993 --> 00:32:39.395
Well, sort of… yeah.

00:32:40.963 --> 00:32:43.566
You may not be able to file
for the marriage registration now,

00:32:43.633 --> 00:32:45.568
but maybe buying a house

00:32:45.635 --> 00:32:47.437
could be the "clamp" instead.

00:32:48.404 --> 00:32:50.740
Then, when breakup talk comes up,
dealing with the mortgage,

00:32:50.807 --> 00:32:53.109
house rights, taxes, etc.…

00:32:53.176 --> 00:32:55.645
Figuring out how to divide things
becomes such a hassle

00:32:55.711 --> 00:32:58.047
that you just give up on breaking up,

00:32:58.114 --> 00:33:00.149
and that way, you and Yoshida

00:33:00.216 --> 00:33:03.186
could then stay together.

00:33:04.353 --> 00:33:06.089
Just being gay makes love meaningless.

00:33:06.155 --> 00:33:07.824
You don’t seriously believe that, right?

00:33:07.890 --> 00:33:10.293
If so, then just like how you, Sakuta,

00:33:10.359 --> 00:33:12.862
create meaning by working hard
on your reservation slips,

00:33:12.929 --> 00:33:15.531
we can create meaning for ourselves.

00:33:16.099 --> 00:33:19.502
"Man was born for love and revolution."

00:33:20.269 --> 00:33:22.205
That was what Dazai said.

00:33:23.406 --> 00:33:25.475
So, let’s buy a house, make it our clamp,

00:33:25.541 --> 00:33:28.945
and prove our love has meaning too!

00:33:29.011 --> 00:33:32.482
That will be our love and revolution!

00:33:34.283 --> 00:33:35.118
Don't you agree?

00:33:37.186 --> 00:33:38.254
Sakuta.

00:33:39.455 --> 00:33:42.158
-Um…
-Could you not come any closer?

00:33:43.059 --> 00:33:45.094
You're scaring me, to say the least.

00:33:45.661 --> 00:33:46.496
Scary?

00:33:46.562 --> 00:33:49.332
You met my ex, looked
at my marriage registration form,

00:33:49.398 --> 00:33:51.200
and the nonsense about houses and clamps.

00:33:51.267 --> 00:33:52.468
Like, what are you on about?

00:33:52.535 --> 00:33:54.937
That's some freaky stuff you're doing.

00:33:55.004 --> 00:33:58.441
Keep this up, and you’ll probably
get arrested one day.

00:33:58.508 --> 00:33:59.642
What?

00:33:59.709 --> 00:34:02.812
Love and revolution, whatever.

00:34:02.879 --> 00:34:04.914
Do as you like.

00:34:04.981 --> 00:34:05.882
Bye.

00:34:13.122 --> 00:34:15.124
I'm such a fool…

00:34:17.894 --> 00:34:19.061
Coming.

00:34:20.129 --> 00:34:20.963
Oh.

00:34:21.564 --> 00:34:23.799
-Hello.
-Hello.

00:34:23.866 --> 00:34:25.668
Right. The parakeet, yes? One sec--

00:34:26.168 --> 00:34:27.003
I'll be back later.

00:34:33.910 --> 00:34:35.011
Coming.

00:34:40.750 --> 00:34:41.684
This is my dad.

00:34:41.751 --> 00:34:43.319
-Huh?
-What?

00:34:43.386 --> 00:34:44.620
What's wrong?

00:34:45.188 --> 00:34:46.756
You're her father?

00:34:47.623 --> 00:34:48.457
Uh, n--

00:34:48.524 --> 00:34:49.759
Yes, he's my dad!

00:34:49.825 --> 00:34:51.427
-Your dad, Hotaru?
-Yes. My dad.

00:34:51.994 --> 00:34:54.597
And this is my homeroom teacher,
Mr. Sakuta.

00:34:56.832 --> 00:34:58.000
What's going on?

00:35:03.539 --> 00:35:05.608
What a small world we live in.

00:35:07.009 --> 00:35:08.277
Are you two friends?

00:35:08.344 --> 00:35:09.579
Not at all.

00:35:10.780 --> 00:35:12.181
‎I see.

00:35:13.716 --> 00:35:17.386
Today I came by to check in
about your daughter.

00:35:17.453 --> 00:35:19.355
-Daughter?
-I'm his daughter. Right, Dad?

00:35:20.690 --> 00:35:22.959
-May I come in?
-Oh, sure!

00:35:23.025 --> 00:35:24.527
-Huh?
-Come on in.

00:35:24.594 --> 00:35:26.062
Hey!

00:35:26.128 --> 00:35:28.164
-Please excuse me.
-Ah, right.

00:35:31.734 --> 00:35:32.735
Dad.

00:35:34.570 --> 00:35:36.005
-Dad!
-Yes?

00:35:36.072 --> 00:35:37.506
Offer him some tea.

00:35:38.975 --> 00:35:41.911
-Please don’t trouble yourself.
-But I should…

00:35:41.978 --> 00:35:44.013
Really, no need. I’m fine.

00:35:45.514 --> 00:35:46.349
Okay.

00:35:49.652 --> 00:35:52.054
Once again, I’m Sakuta,
her homeroom teacher.

00:35:53.356 --> 00:35:54.390
I'm Hatano.

00:35:54.457 --> 00:35:56.892
With Hotaru’s future path
needing to be decided soon,

00:35:56.959 --> 00:36:00.696
I wanted to meet you and discuss it
together. That’s why I came today.

00:36:01.831 --> 00:36:02.832
First and foremost,

00:36:03.899 --> 00:36:06.335
about going on to high school…

00:36:06.402 --> 00:36:08.571
Shall I assume she plans to do so?

00:36:10.906 --> 00:36:12.441
I’m still thinking about it.

00:36:13.042 --> 00:36:15.578
Personally, if you don’t have
a clear idea of your future

00:36:15.645 --> 00:36:17.680
or what you want to do yet,

00:36:17.747 --> 00:36:20.049
it’s better to move forward
with high school.

00:36:21.050 --> 00:36:23.886
Right now, Kusunoki's grades are…

00:36:23.953 --> 00:36:25.154
No! Shoo!

00:36:25.221 --> 00:36:26.922
Bad boy! Shoo!

00:36:28.057 --> 00:36:29.091
Sorry about that.

00:36:29.925 --> 00:36:33.663
If she pushes just a little harder,
referrals and more choices will open up.

00:36:35.131 --> 00:36:37.667
Do you have any idea
what kind of high school you’d like?

00:36:38.234 --> 00:36:39.568
It’s best to decide early.

00:36:39.635 --> 00:36:41.637
Okay. I’ll think about it.

00:36:45.474 --> 00:36:47.777
And what about you, as her father?

00:36:51.747 --> 00:36:53.883
He’s still thinking it over too.
Right, Dad?

00:36:55.951 --> 00:36:56.952
Yes…

00:36:58.688 --> 00:37:02.024
I said stop that! Go, shoo!

00:37:03.359 --> 00:37:04.393
Sorry about that.

00:37:08.230 --> 00:37:11.167
Could I speak with your father
alone for a bit?

00:37:11.667 --> 00:37:12.902
-What?
-Huh?

00:37:21.644 --> 00:37:22.745
About Hotaru…

00:37:23.512 --> 00:37:25.281
How is she like at home?

00:37:28.617 --> 00:37:30.386
She was taken into custody
in Toyoko the other day.

00:37:30.986 --> 00:37:32.321
Have you heard about it?

00:37:35.157 --> 00:37:36.492
‎Um…

00:37:37.693 --> 00:37:38.794
Could I get a reply?

00:37:40.329 --> 00:37:42.965
-Yes.
-With the incident and all, life is hard.

00:37:43.032 --> 00:37:44.533
What?

00:37:44.600 --> 00:37:47.169
Whatever the circumstances, please…

00:37:47.737 --> 00:37:49.805
Please make Hotaru your top priority.

00:37:52.241 --> 00:37:53.976
This is a crucial stage for her.

00:37:54.043 --> 00:37:55.444
Her third year of middle school.

00:37:56.178 --> 00:37:57.880
Buying a house, clamps,

00:37:58.681 --> 00:37:59.749
and what else was it?

00:38:00.916 --> 00:38:01.984
Love and revolution?

00:38:02.051 --> 00:38:05.087
If you’ve got time to poke your nose
in my affairs--

00:38:06.288 --> 00:38:08.290
I’ll go buy some tea.

00:38:09.258 --> 00:38:10.092
What?

00:38:11.560 --> 00:38:12.428
Hey!

00:38:14.697 --> 00:38:15.865
Hey!

00:38:16.832 --> 00:38:17.900
What's going on?

00:38:17.967 --> 00:38:19.435
Please play along.

00:38:20.836 --> 00:38:21.804
I'm begging you.

00:38:27.209 --> 00:38:28.611
‎HIBINO REAL ESTATE CO., LTD.

00:38:31.847 --> 00:38:34.150
Is there something you want right now?

00:38:36.485 --> 00:38:38.988
-What?
-As of this moment. Anything?

00:38:48.864 --> 00:38:49.999
Where's my dad?

00:38:50.065 --> 00:38:51.467
He went to buy tea.

00:38:53.836 --> 00:38:55.438
What were you looking at?

00:38:55.504 --> 00:38:56.405
HOUSE FOR SALE

00:38:57.006 --> 00:38:57.873
A house?

00:39:03.846 --> 00:39:05.481
DRINKS CORNER

00:39:07.917 --> 00:39:09.185
42,500,000 YEN

00:39:16.792 --> 00:39:17.993
Welcome home!

00:39:20.663 --> 00:39:21.730
Dad, the tea?

00:39:25.835 --> 00:39:26.702
VANILLA ICE CREAM

00:39:27.503 --> 00:39:28.637
Where's the tea?

00:39:29.338 --> 00:39:30.773
This is in place of the tea.

00:39:31.674 --> 00:39:34.210
Ah, I only asked for two spoons.

00:39:35.277 --> 00:39:36.645
This spoon's from the other day.

00:39:37.613 --> 00:39:38.781
Here.

00:39:38.848 --> 00:39:40.316
We're eating straight from this?

00:39:42.718 --> 00:39:43.919
Uh…

00:39:52.328 --> 00:39:53.596
Okay then, let's dig in.

00:39:54.129 --> 00:39:55.197
Yeah.

00:40:04.006 --> 00:40:06.041
Well, okay.

00:40:16.919 --> 00:40:19.421
Let’s talk about our favorite ice cream.

00:40:20.689 --> 00:40:23.759
My favorite is the one
with ramune on the outside

00:40:23.826 --> 00:40:26.061
and vanilla on the inside.

00:40:26.128 --> 00:40:28.964
Refreshing and sweet. Best of both worlds.

00:40:30.165 --> 00:40:31.000
What about you?

00:40:33.435 --> 00:40:35.771
I'm the soft serve kind of person,
I suppose.

00:40:35.838 --> 00:40:38.207
The half chocolate, half vanilla kind?

00:40:38.707 --> 00:40:40.376
Just vanilla.

00:40:40.442 --> 00:40:41.443
No way.

00:40:41.944 --> 00:40:44.413
But the half-and-half ones
are the best deal!

00:40:46.482 --> 00:40:47.483
Yeah.

00:40:49.051 --> 00:40:51.453
What about you, Dad? What’s your favorite?

00:40:56.125 --> 00:40:57.626
Homerun Bars, I guess.

00:40:59.395 --> 00:41:01.363
The ice cream with a winning stick.

00:41:01.430 --> 00:41:02.264
That's cool.

00:41:04.066 --> 00:41:06.402
I used to eat those with him.

00:41:07.803 --> 00:41:09.905
The first guy I ever liked.

00:41:09.972 --> 00:41:11.206
What?

00:41:11.941 --> 00:41:13.876
We ate so many together,

00:41:13.943 --> 00:41:16.011
but I never once won.

00:41:17.479 --> 00:41:22.117
You know how people say it’s because
of karma, or you’ve done something wrong?

00:41:23.085 --> 00:41:25.187
I actually believed that.

00:41:27.556 --> 00:41:28.791
I thought the reason I didn’t win

00:41:29.992 --> 00:41:33.028
was because I liked a guy.

00:41:34.463 --> 00:41:35.831
That it was something wrong.

00:41:37.166 --> 00:41:39.368
So God wouldn’t let me win.

00:41:40.970 --> 00:41:41.870
I always

00:41:42.905 --> 00:41:44.640
felt out of place.

00:41:45.507 --> 00:41:49.345
That loving someone, dating,

00:41:49.411 --> 00:41:51.180
living together,

00:41:51.246 --> 00:41:54.516
and sharing ice cream were forbidden.

00:41:55.651 --> 00:41:58.120
Something I wasn’t allowed to want.

00:42:00.022 --> 00:42:01.690
I know that it's not true,

00:42:02.725 --> 00:42:06.095
but part of me still believes it.

00:42:13.068 --> 00:42:15.037
I’ve gotten used to giving up on things.

00:42:15.771 --> 00:42:19.174
But here we are,
eating ice cream together.

00:42:26.448 --> 00:42:29.652
If you don’t truly let yourself want
what you want, you’ll never have it.

00:42:33.455 --> 00:42:35.090
So, I’ve decided to let myself want it.

00:42:37.526 --> 00:42:38.861
You want a house?

00:42:38.927 --> 00:42:39.762
What?

00:42:46.235 --> 00:42:47.102
Yeah.

00:42:47.803 --> 00:42:48.871
I want a house.

00:42:49.371 --> 00:42:51.373
After the beep,

00:42:51.440 --> 00:42:54.109
please leave your name and message.

00:42:54.610 --> 00:42:55.878
Hello.

00:42:55.944 --> 00:42:57.680
So, the other day,

00:42:57.746 --> 00:42:59.114
someone new moved in.

00:43:00.683 --> 00:43:03.385
And for some reason,
he really wants a house.

00:43:05.020 --> 00:43:07.823
So, I thought about it too.
What do I want?

00:43:09.925 --> 00:43:12.761
I want everything that everyone else has.

00:43:14.830 --> 00:43:16.665
Ah! I'm such an idiot!

00:43:18.834 --> 00:43:20.269
Coming. Oh.

00:43:20.335 --> 00:43:21.403
I’m coming in for a bit.

00:43:21.470 --> 00:43:24.273
I might not get it,
but I want to give it a shot.

00:43:24.773 --> 00:43:26.075
Here…

00:43:27.543 --> 00:43:28.610
Huh?

00:43:29.411 --> 00:43:30.245
What the?

00:43:30.312 --> 00:43:32.481
-There’s 30 million yen in here.
-Thirty million?

00:43:33.549 --> 00:43:36.018
You want a house, right?

00:43:36.085 --> 00:43:39.254
I will buy you.

00:43:46.095 --> 00:43:47.429
SHIZUOKA'S SOUVENIRS

00:43:47.496 --> 00:43:48.597
‎Mom…

00:43:50.132 --> 00:43:51.800
Mom, is there something you want?

00:43:52.568 --> 00:43:53.902
What was it you wanted?

00:43:55.070 --> 00:43:57.339
Talk to you later, okay?

00:44:08.617 --> 00:44:09.685
I found it.

00:45:51.353 --> 00:45:53.222
