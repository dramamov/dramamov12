00:00:09.920 --> 00:00:13.390
Once upon a time, a man had a
dream he was a floating butterfly.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.170
When the butterfly became weary,

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:19.460
it landed on the
branch and fell asleep.

00:00:20.710 --> 00:00:22.420
When the butterfly slept,

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:23.920
the man woke up.

00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:26.670
When the man fell
back asleep again,

00:00:26.790 --> 00:00:28.170
the butterfly awakened.

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:30.130
When the butterfly
went to sleep,

00:00:30.170 --> 00:00:31.460
the man'd awoken.

00:00:32.080 --> 00:00:33.380
The man slept,

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:34.420
the butterfly awoke.

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:37.710
Over and over.

00:00:57.630 --> 00:00:58.960
Alan...wait!

00:00:58.960 --> 00:00:59.960
What now!

00:01:00.580 --> 00:01:02.170
Are you never going to trust me?

00:01:02.830 --> 00:01:03.830
Trust?

00:01:04.129 --> 00:01:05.540
This word again, Win?

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:08.080
I once trusted you
the most, you know?

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:09.670
But so what?

00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:10.830
You lied to me

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:12.539
even more than those fuckers!

00:01:17.539 --> 00:01:18.250
I'm not letting you go,

00:01:18.250 --> 00:01:19.920
Don't you feel the
same way about me?

00:01:20.830 --> 00:01:22.630
Do you realize how
much pain I've been in?

00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:23.960
Hmm?

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:26.289
The lies from others
weren't that bad.

00:01:26.710 --> 00:01:28.039
But the lies you told

00:01:28.539 --> 00:01:30.039
were the most agonizing!

00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:33.630
And how could you be so sure

00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:35.710
that the truth you've been seeking...

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:38.000
wouldn't hurt you?

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:41.580
What if it separates us?

00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:43.330
You'd let that happen?

00:01:47.539 --> 00:01:49.380
Let me tell you something, Win.

00:01:52.539 --> 00:01:53.539
The lies

00:01:56.080 --> 00:01:57.710
can never develop into love.

00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:00.500
Will you let me go?

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:01.250
No.

00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:02.250
Please don't go.

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:06.750
Help, help!

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:07.960
A patient is trying to escape!

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:09.750
Help me!

00:02:09.789 --> 00:02:11.210
Keep your voice down!

00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:12.290
Help!

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:14.290
I said, quiet.

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:14.920
Win.

00:02:16.210 --> 00:02:17.920
Help, help!

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:19.540
This way!

00:02:20.079 --> 00:02:21.460
Let go of me!

00:02:21.829 --> 00:02:23.079
Help!

00:02:24.329 --> 00:02:25.329
Help!

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:28.920
Help.

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:31.920
Help, a patient is escaping!

00:02:32.329 --> 00:02:34.380
Help...

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:46.500
Does it hurt?

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:50.630
Please understand me.

00:02:52.710 --> 00:02:54.380
But I must learn the truth today.

00:04:05.290 --> 00:04:09.170
Patient's Medical Record.

00:05:26.290 --> 00:05:27.290
Remember!

00:05:27.920 --> 00:05:29.130
Catch him, quick!

00:05:31.210 --> 00:05:32.210
Get him out!

00:05:32.250 --> 00:05:33.380
Let go!

00:05:35.250 --> 00:05:36.670
Let me go!

00:05:36.710 --> 00:05:38.710
Release me.

00:05:38.920 --> 00:05:39.920
Let go!

00:05:41.580 --> 00:05:43.960
Let go...

00:05:46.500 --> 00:05:48.170
Let go!

00:05:48.330 --> 00:05:49.330
Let go!

00:05:49.500 --> 00:05:50.500
Let...

00:05:50.500 --> 00:05:52.080
Let me go now!

00:05:52.880 --> 00:05:56.380
Let me go...

00:05:56.630 --> 00:05:57.630
No!

00:06:21.630 --> 00:06:22.630
Let go now!

00:06:25.880 --> 00:06:26.880
Stay back!

00:06:32.500 --> 00:06:33.500
Alan.

00:06:34.790 --> 00:06:35.790
Hold him still.

00:06:36.500 --> 00:06:37.500
Alan.

00:06:37.500 --> 00:06:38.500
Alan.

00:06:39.130 --> 00:06:40.130
Alan!

00:06:43.670 --> 00:06:45.250
Let me go.

00:06:58.380 --> 00:06:59.830
I'm sorry, Win.

00:07:00.830 --> 00:07:03.080
Don't let them do this to me.

00:07:03.460 --> 00:07:04.460
Win.

00:07:04.750 --> 00:07:06.540
Win...

00:07:07.210 --> 00:07:08.210
Win...

00:08:03.040 --> 00:08:05.080
Ten seconds after
waking up from a dream

00:08:05.670 --> 00:08:07.710
was like retaining
the water in the palms.

00:08:08.500 --> 00:08:10.330
Despite your best efforts,

00:08:10.830 --> 00:08:13.290
water would always seep through
the gap between your fingers.

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:16.920
It was the same with
the dream after I woke up.

00:08:18.210 --> 00:08:21.630
The stories I dreamed about were
leaked out of my memory space.

00:08:29.880 --> 00:08:31.960
Only lingering
feelings remained.

00:08:36.289 --> 00:08:38.250
Similar to the
moisture on the palms.

00:08:59.420 --> 00:09:00.420
Alan, you hungry?

00:09:04.380 --> 00:09:05.380
Who are you?

00:09:05.380 --> 00:09:06.380
Alan.

00:09:07.540 --> 00:09:08.580
I'm your dad.

00:09:10.920 --> 00:09:11.920
Here you go again.

00:09:13.960 --> 00:09:15.210
Nightmare, was it?

00:09:16.130 --> 00:09:17.130
I thought so.

00:09:17.460 --> 00:09:18.920
You probably had a vivid dream.

00:09:19.880 --> 00:09:21.580
that's why you wake
up confused this way.

00:09:25.130 --> 00:09:26.130
Why...

00:09:27.500 --> 00:09:29.290
Why can't I remember anything?

00:09:32.290 --> 00:09:34.130
You have dementia, Alan.

00:09:34.580 --> 00:09:35.580
But don't worry.

00:09:36.830 --> 00:09:37.830
Just try to think slowly,

00:09:38.880 --> 00:09:39.880
you'll recall eventually.

00:09:47.500 --> 00:09:48.580
Let me help you with that.

00:09:50.380 --> 00:09:51.420
It's alright.

00:09:52.210 --> 00:09:53.540
You should have some rest.

00:10:21.170 --> 00:10:23.380
How about a little medication
to help you feel better?

00:10:33.290 --> 00:10:34.290
No, thank you.

00:10:34.540 --> 00:10:36.250
I'm feeling better now.

00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:45.000
Well then...

00:10:45.960 --> 00:10:47.130
Go get washed up,

00:10:48.210 --> 00:10:49.670
then come have
breakfast downstairs.

00:10:54.630 --> 00:10:55.630
Okay.

00:11:13.040 --> 00:11:15.040
Well, Fortunately.

00:11:15.790 --> 00:11:17.790
I still haven't forgotten
that my name's Alan

00:11:18.290 --> 00:11:19.290
Bunnalai.

00:11:46.170 --> 00:11:47.170
Are you full, Alan?

00:11:47.830 --> 00:11:48.960
You can have more.

00:11:53.210 --> 00:11:54.210
I've had enough.

00:11:54.710 --> 00:11:55.960
The food was excellent.

00:11:56.170 --> 00:11:57.170
Thank you.

00:11:57.880 --> 00:11:59.330
Don't forget to
take your medicine

00:12:07.750 --> 00:12:09.670
and drink plenty of water afterward.

00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:52.830
Then go write in your
diary after you're finished.

00:12:53.210 --> 00:12:54.460
I'll go wash the dishes.

00:12:57.750 --> 00:12:59.290
Go ahead, Alan.

00:12:59.290 --> 00:13:00.460
Before you forget again.

00:13:02.540 --> 00:13:03.920
The notebook is over there.

00:13:18.580 --> 00:13:20.710
Today I dozed off in the moning.

00:13:22.040 --> 00:13:24.000
I got up again
late in the morning.

00:13:25.630 --> 00:13:27.040
Had a little headache.

00:13:28.750 --> 00:13:31.250
It took me fifteen seconds

00:13:31.920 --> 00:13:33.500
to recall who I was today.

00:13:39.040 --> 00:13:40.670
Actually, it was a
bit longer than that.

00:13:42.250 --> 00:13:44.080
My father was there
when I woke up.

00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:47.000
I was so shocked

00:13:47.750 --> 00:13:49.790
and accidentally broke his dishes.

00:13:51.710 --> 00:13:53.290
I've taken the medicine today.

00:13:53.880 --> 00:13:55.080
Do not take more!

00:14:18.170 --> 00:14:20.250
It happened again today.

00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:24.920
He showed up to me
in my bedroom mirror.

00:14:27.250 --> 00:14:29.000
He tried to tell me...

00:14:29.750 --> 00:14:30.750
"Remember"

00:14:31.830 --> 00:14:33.130
Remember?

00:14:33.290 --> 00:14:34.290
Remember!

00:14:34.330 --> 00:14:35.960
Are you done?

00:14:52.380 --> 00:14:53.380
Dad.

00:14:56.170 --> 00:14:57.630
Did I see a ghost, dad?

00:14:59.460 --> 00:15:01.040
I've already told you

00:15:01.330 --> 00:15:02.790
that it wasn't a ghost.

00:15:03.920 --> 00:15:05.330
You saw things
because you're unwell.

00:15:06.630 --> 00:15:08.290
How could it not be a ghost?

00:15:08.670 --> 00:15:11.750
Here in this diary I pointed
out that it was a ghost.

00:15:12.920 --> 00:15:14.460
Listen to me, Alan.

00:15:15.960 --> 00:15:17.290
Because you were sick,

00:15:17.670 --> 00:15:19.960
you had hallucinations
whenever you looked in the mirror.

00:15:24.130 --> 00:15:27.130
This means you never
wrote down what I said, right?

00:15:28.080 --> 00:15:29.630
Alan, you've promised me.

00:15:30.500 --> 00:15:33.580
Why didn't you record
something this serious?

00:15:42.040 --> 00:15:44.080
In this case, write
it down right now.

00:15:46.500 --> 00:15:47.500
Everything

00:15:48.290 --> 00:15:49.290
that you saw

00:15:50.790 --> 00:15:52.170
was a result of your illness.

00:15:53.130 --> 00:15:54.710
The things you
saw were illusions.

00:15:55.880 --> 00:15:57.330
This is an important matter.

00:15:58.000 --> 00:15:59.500
You must write it down every time.

00:16:13.380 --> 00:16:14.380
Okay.

00:16:16.130 --> 00:16:17.750
Can you stay at home
by yourself, Alan?

00:16:17.920 --> 00:16:19.040
Of course, dad.

00:16:19.250 --> 00:16:20.250
You don't need to worry.

00:16:21.290 --> 00:16:22.290
Sure you can?

00:16:24.880 --> 00:16:27.710
Lunch is in the fridge.

00:16:28.040 --> 00:16:30.960
When you're hungry, just heat it up.

00:16:31.670 --> 00:16:33.000
The snacks are on the table.

00:16:33.460 --> 00:16:35.830
And my number is
written on the table.

00:16:35.880 --> 00:16:37.380
You can get to work now, Dad.

00:16:43.330 --> 00:16:44.960
Promise me

00:16:44.960 --> 00:16:46.960
that you won't go walk
outside by yourself.

00:16:47.460 --> 00:16:49.040
Because if the symptoms return,

00:16:49.540 --> 00:16:51.210
you'll forget your way home again.

00:16:51.210 --> 00:16:52.540
I'm not going anywhere.

00:16:53.500 --> 00:16:54.580
Then, I'll get going now.

00:16:54.580 --> 00:16:55.580
Be back soon.

00:17:02.710 --> 00:17:04.670
I'm furious with myself
for having dementia

00:17:04.710 --> 00:17:06.460
that prevents me from
remembering anything.

00:17:06.960 --> 00:17:08.750
It's like living a shortened life.

00:17:09.210 --> 00:17:11.380
Die and be reborn
again with no memories.

00:17:16.960 --> 00:17:18.880
There's only this diary

00:17:18.880 --> 00:17:20.540
that guides me
through everything.

00:17:21.460 --> 00:17:23.880
Other than my repetitive routines,

00:17:23.880 --> 00:17:25.579
which have to be
written down everyday...

00:17:26.460 --> 00:17:29.040
The inside is filled with stories about one
old man

00:17:29.080 --> 00:17:31.330
who has always appeared to me.

00:17:32.380 --> 00:17:35.250
And the only place
where he'd ever manifest

00:17:35.750 --> 00:17:36.920
is in every mirror.

00:18:04.880 --> 00:18:05.880
Hey!

00:18:07.250 --> 00:18:08.250
Open the door.
เปิดประตูให้หน่อย

00:18:29.080 --> 00:18:30.080
What's up.
ไงพวกเป็นไงบ้าง

00:18:30.630 --> 00:18:31.070
Good.
ดี

00:18:31.100 --> 00:18:32.100
What brings you here?
มาไงวะ

00:18:32.480 --> 00:18:33.480
Where have you been?
มึงหายไปไหนมา

00:18:34.200 --> 00:18:35.110
Come on in.
เข้ามาก่อน

00:18:35.410 --> 00:18:36.580
You didn't go to school.
เรียนก็ไม่ไปเรียน

00:18:37.400 --> 00:18:38.780
You did not take your exams.
สอบก็ไม่ไปสอบ

00:18:39.170 --> 00:18:40.240
Relax, man.
ใจเย็น

00:18:40.520 --> 00:18:42.520
I just got out of the hospital.
กูไม่ค่อยสบาย เพิ่งออกจากโรงพยาบาล

00:18:42.550 --> 00:18:44.420
You were sick and you didn't tell me about it?
มึงป่วยเหรอไม่บอกกูสักคำ

00:18:45.800 --> 00:18:46.820
Let's talk inside, come on.
เข้าไปคุยกันข้างในเถอะ

00:18:47.670 --> 00:18:49.000
The weather is so hot, right?
อากาศข้างนอกโคตรร้อนเลย

00:18:49.600 --> 00:18:50.850
This is so good.
อร่อยดี

00:18:51.510 --> 00:18:53.060
So what's up, man?
สรุปมึงเป็นอะไรวะ

00:18:56.840 --> 00:18:58.080
I don't know where to start.
กูก็ไม่รู้จะเริ่มยังไงว่ะ

00:18:58.130 --> 00:19:00.280
I don't even know that it's my vision
กูไม่รู้ว่ามันเป็นภาพหลอน

00:19:00.720 --> 00:19:01.700
or a ghost.
หรือว่าผี

00:19:04.220 --> 00:19:04.990
What do you think?
มึงคิดว่าไง

00:19:07.230 --> 00:19:10.390
Do you get like a good look on his face?
มึงเห็นหน้าตามันไหม

00:19:10.440 --> 00:19:11.940
Like... how does he look like?
มันหน้าตาเป็นยังไง

00:19:12.460 --> 00:19:13.460
Yeah.
เห็น

00:19:15.210 --> 00:19:16.380
He has white hair,
มันมีผมสีขาว

00:19:17.830 --> 00:19:18.830
white beard...
หนวดขาว

00:19:19.920 --> 00:19:20.920
and his eyes...!
และตามัน

00:19:22.710 --> 00:19:23.880
He looks really angry.
ดูเหมือนกำลังโกรธอยู่

00:19:24.380 --> 00:19:26.210
And he always appeared in the mirror.
มันชอบโผล่มาในกระจก

00:19:28.880 --> 00:19:30.460
That's so super scary, dude.
เชี่ย น่ากลัวชิบ

00:19:31.540 --> 00:19:32.830
Do you think ghosts are real?
มึงว่าผีมีจริงป่าววะ

00:19:35.000 --> 00:19:36.380
I think they are.
กูเชื่อว่ามีนะ

00:19:36.830 --> 00:19:38.540
They're like what got left behind
มันคือสิ่งที่หลงเหลือไว้

00:19:38.960 --> 00:19:40.130
long after they were dead.
หลังจากที่พวกเขาตายไปแล้ว

00:19:41.210 --> 00:19:42.750
What do you mean got left behind?
หลงเหลือยังไงวะ

00:19:44.040 --> 00:19:45.040
Come here.
เข้ามานี่

00:19:46.330 --> 00:19:47.790
Come closer.
ใกล้อีก

00:19:50.170 --> 00:19:51.170
You smell that?
มึงได้กลิ่นไหม

00:19:51.170 --> 00:19:52.000
Yeah.
เออ

00:19:52.500 --> 00:19:53.500
A perfume?
น้ำหอมมึงเหรอ

00:19:55.170 --> 00:19:56.540
Smells good, huh?
หอมเนอะ

00:19:57.290 --> 00:19:58.880
What's wrong with you, man?
อะไรของมึง

00:19:58.880 --> 00:20:00.330
Have you read a book the german book
มึงเคยอ่านหนังสือของเยอรมันไหม

00:20:02.080 --> 00:20:03.080
"Perfume"?
เรื่องเพอร์ฟูม

00:20:03.130 --> 00:20:04.460
Yeah, I think so.
น่าจะเคยมั้ง

00:20:05.380 --> 00:20:06.040
What about it?
มันเกี่ยวกับอะไรวะ

00:20:06.170 --> 00:20:07.170
In the book...
ในหนังสือ

00:20:08.080 --> 00:20:09.270
It says that the perfumes
มันบอกว่าน้ำหอมเนี่ย

00:20:09.290 --> 00:20:11.250
are just like withering flowers,
สกัดจากดอกไม้ที่ตายไปแล้ว

00:20:11.840 --> 00:20:13.390
the smell got left behind
กลิ่นมันยังชวนให้หลอกหลอน

00:20:13.420 --> 00:20:14.960
to haunt us long after it left.
แม้มันจะตายไปแล้ว

00:20:20.210 --> 00:20:21.210
Hey.
เฮ้ย

00:20:23.420 --> 00:20:24.420
You okay?
มึงโอเครึเปล่า

00:20:27.460 --> 00:20:28.830
I don't know man.
กูก็ไม่รู้ว่ะ

00:20:31.080 --> 00:20:32.580
I can't remember...
กูจำอะไรไม่ได้เลย

00:20:34.960 --> 00:20:35.960
yesterday
เรื่องของเมื่อวาน

00:20:36.380 --> 00:20:37.670
and the morning.
เมื่อเช้า

00:20:38.500 --> 00:20:39.670
Even my father.
แม้แต่พ่อของกู

00:20:39.880 --> 00:20:40.880
Or even you.
หรือแม้กระทั่งมึง

00:20:42.210 --> 00:20:43.210
I don't know what to do.
กูไม่รู้ว่าต้องทำยังไง

00:20:44.000 --> 00:20:45.460
It feels very bad.
รู้สึกแย่มาก ๆ เลยว่ะ

00:20:45.750 --> 00:20:46.750
Hey.
เฮ้ ๆ

00:20:49.130 --> 00:20:50.500
It's not that bad.
เดี๋ยวมึงก็ดีขึ้น

00:20:50.500 --> 00:20:51.880
I don't know what to do, man!
กูไม่รู้จำทำยังไงว่ะ

00:20:52.500 --> 00:20:53.790
You still remember me, right?
แต่มึงก็ยังจำกูได้ใช่ไหมล่ะ

00:20:55.710 --> 00:20:56.750
You'll all get better.
เดี๋ยวมึงก็ดีขึ้น

00:20:59.000 --> 00:21:00.000
Thanks, man.
ขอบคุณมึงมาก

00:21:00.670 --> 00:21:02.170
Everything will be fine.
ทุกอย่างจะต้องดีขึ้น

00:21:08.130 --> 00:21:09.130
Let's go, man.
มาเร็ว

00:21:09.630 --> 00:21:11.130
Don't worry.
มึงไม่ต้องกังวลหรอก

00:21:11.630 --> 00:21:12.880
You look really normal to me. You're definitely not crazy.
กูว่ามึงก็ดูปกติดี

00:21:15.170 --> 00:21:16.920
I mean, whatever is going on,
ไม่ว่าจะเกิดอะไรขึ้น

00:21:16.920 --> 00:21:17.920
it should end soon.
เดี๋ยวมันก็ผ่านไป

00:21:18.630 --> 00:21:19.630
Or may be...
หรือว่าบางที

00:21:19.830 --> 00:21:22.670
there's like a vengeful ghost staying at your place
บ้านหลังนี้อาจเคยมีคนตายมากอ่น

00:21:23.040 --> 00:21:24.640
and he's really angry that you
แล้วเขาก็โกรธมาก

00:21:24.670 --> 00:21:26.080
and your father are staying here,
ที่มึงกับพ่อมาอยู่ที่นี่

00:21:26.460 --> 00:21:29.330
so he's super pissed and he's here to haunt you.
เขาก็เลยมาหลอกหลอนมึง

00:21:31.290 --> 00:21:32.290
Come on, man.
ไม่เอาน่า

00:21:33.080 --> 00:21:34.080
Don't play a joke here.
เลิกแกล้งกูได้แล้ว

00:21:36.420 --> 00:21:37.420
But...
แต่ว่า

00:21:38.750 --> 00:21:39.750
What if he's real?
ถ้ามีผีจริง

00:21:41.040 --> 00:21:42.040
What should I do?
กูควรทำยังไงดีวะ

00:21:44.420 --> 00:21:46.250
You should communicate with him.
มึงควรสื่อสารกับเขา

00:21:46.880 --> 00:21:48.830
You know, like maybe you can get a medium
มึงอาจพาหมอผีมา

00:21:48.880 --> 00:21:49.880
or maybe you and your father
หรือมึงกับพ่อ

00:21:49.920 --> 00:21:51.540
can pray and talk to him like…
อาจจะขอโทษแล้วบอกเขาว่า

00:21:51.540 --> 00:21:52.920
Hello, excuse me. Can I stay here, please?
สวัสดีครับ ขอโทษนะครับ ขออยู่ที่นี่ได้ไหม

00:21:54.880 --> 00:21:56.460
You're Thai, you should know that.
ลองก็ไม่เสียหายนะเว้ย

00:21:57.250 --> 00:21:58.170
Stop it.
หยุดเลย พอเลย

00:21:58.210 --> 00:21:59.040
I'm trying to help.
กูพยายามช่วยอยู่

00:21:59.080 --> 00:22:00.040
1 serious.
กูจริงจังนะเว้ย

00:22:01.130 --> 00:22:02.630
You will be fine, trust me.
เดี๋ยวมึงก็ดีขึ้น เชื่อกูดิ

00:22:03.040 --> 00:22:03.790
Okay.
โอเค

00:22:03.790 --> 00:22:05.380
I'll see you next time.
ไว้เจอกัน

00:22:05.830 --> 00:22:06.830
Okay.
โอเค

00:22:07.460 --> 00:22:08.460
See you, man.
แล้วเจอกัน

00:22:08.500 --> 00:22:09.500
Drive safe.
ขับรถดี ๆ

00:22:13.080 --> 00:22:14.080
Who are you?

00:22:14.630 --> 00:22:15.960
You're finally
awake, sleepy head?

00:22:16.920 --> 00:22:17.710
So mean.

00:22:18.880 --> 00:22:20.580
What kind of dream
feels this real?

00:22:20.630 --> 00:22:22.130
So I'm the man of your dreams, right?

00:22:23.540 --> 00:22:25.040
If this is not a dream,

00:22:25.040 --> 00:22:26.040
then prove it.

00:22:26.210 --> 00:22:27.210
Gotcha.

00:22:34.380 --> 00:22:35.380
Thanks.

00:22:45.500 --> 00:22:46.500
Is something wrong?

00:22:48.790 --> 00:22:49.790
Nothing.

00:22:56.960 --> 00:22:58.420
Just wanted to ask

00:22:59.080 --> 00:23:02.250
if you've been able to
remember your dreams lately.

00:23:02.790 --> 00:23:04.920
Are you still dreaming
about that ghostly old man?

00:23:06.380 --> 00:23:08.210
Try to remember.

00:23:09.710 --> 00:23:10.750
I think I do.

00:23:13.380 --> 00:23:15.000
Are you still scared, Alan?

00:23:17.460 --> 00:23:18.460
I'm still scared.

00:23:19.380 --> 00:23:20.380
But...

00:23:21.540 --> 00:23:22.540
But what?

00:23:23.330 --> 00:23:24.330
I think...

00:23:24.380 --> 00:23:26.830
he wanted to tell me something.

00:23:29.580 --> 00:23:31.210
What makes you think that way?

00:23:32.080 --> 00:23:33.580
I had no idea.

00:23:34.040 --> 00:23:35.290
I just get the feeling

00:23:35.710 --> 00:23:38.210
that there's something he wants to tell me.

00:23:41.000 --> 00:23:42.630
You're overthinking, Alan.

00:23:44.000 --> 00:23:45.080
No, Dad.

00:23:45.130 --> 00:23:46.330
I definitely sense that.

00:23:47.040 --> 00:23:48.040
Maybe

00:23:48.040 --> 00:23:50.250
I should try opening
up and talk to him.

00:23:52.960 --> 00:23:54.210
Open up to what?

00:23:54.960 --> 00:23:57.670
You must understand
that all of this was a dream.

00:23:58.920 --> 00:24:00.460
If you continue to think this way

00:24:01.750 --> 00:24:03.290
then when will
you ever get better?

00:24:07.580 --> 00:24:08.580
Sorry.

00:24:11.790 --> 00:24:14.670
Have you recorded
today's dream in the diary

00:24:15.670 --> 00:24:16.830
for the doctor to read?

00:24:20.460 --> 00:24:21.460
I haven't.

00:24:22.830 --> 00:24:25.710
Look, I told you many times
to write it down right away.

00:24:26.880 --> 00:24:29.420
Otherwise, how are you going
to remember what you did?

00:24:34.460 --> 00:24:36.630
I'll write it down as soon
as I get back to my room.

00:24:41.580 --> 00:24:43.170
We've come this far, Alan.

00:24:44.540 --> 00:24:46.000
You need to cooperate

00:24:47.040 --> 00:24:48.380
if you want to recover.

00:24:50.920 --> 00:24:51.920
Okay.

00:25:00.000 --> 00:25:01.420
Was there anyone else

00:25:02.460 --> 00:25:04.170
who entered your dreams?

00:25:07.790 --> 00:25:09.330
So I'm the man of your dreams, right?

00:25:15.540 --> 00:25:16.460
Nope.

00:25:38.330 --> 00:25:39.960
Long, dirty hair.

00:25:40.710 --> 00:25:41.710
Messy beard.

00:25:42.710 --> 00:25:44.540
Serious and angered expression

00:25:44.540 --> 00:25:46.130
beneath the wrinkled skin

00:25:46.130 --> 00:25:47.420
on an unemotional face.

00:25:48.330 --> 00:25:50.040
And those apathetic pair of eyes...

00:25:50.420 --> 00:25:52.420
They are very familiar to me.

00:25:52.460 --> 00:25:55.380
Still, I'm scared to communicate
with what's in front of me

00:25:56.210 --> 00:25:58.330
because I'm well aware
that it's not human.

00:25:59.210 --> 00:26:01.000
And I am the only person

00:26:01.250 --> 00:26:03.080
that this ghost of
an old man is after.

00:26:03.830 --> 00:26:05.380
What does he really want from me?

00:30:23.000 --> 00:30:24.000
Dad?

00:30:29.710 --> 00:30:30.710
Dad!

00:30:37.960 --> 00:30:38.960
Dad!

00:30:49.380 --> 00:30:50.380
Dad.

00:30:57.750 --> 00:30:58.750
Is that you?

00:31:26.420 --> 00:31:27.420
So, what's it gonna be?

00:31:27.790 --> 00:31:28.960
What do you want from me?

00:31:29.920 --> 00:31:30.920
What do you want?

00:31:32.460 --> 00:31:33.580
Where are you?

00:31:33.580 --> 00:31:34.460
Huh?

00:31:34.460 --> 00:31:35.460
Where you at?

00:31:37.250 --> 00:31:38.960
Come out and show
me what you got!

00:31:40.420 --> 00:31:42.380
Stop lurking in the shadows!

00:31:43.040 --> 00:31:44.040
Come on!

00:31:44.380 --> 00:31:45.380
Come out here!

00:31:47.330 --> 00:31:48.830
Come at me, damnit!

00:31:53.000 --> 00:31:54.290
Upstairs?

00:31:54.630 --> 00:31:55.750
You're up there, huh?

00:31:59.790 --> 00:32:01.540
Are we doing this or what?

00:32:01.540 --> 00:32:02.790
Where the hell are you?

00:32:02.790 --> 00:32:04.040
Think you're tough?

00:32:04.040 --> 00:32:05.460
Then come out and get me!

00:32:06.000 --> 00:32:07.080
Where are you?

00:32:07.630 --> 00:32:08.830
You're not coming out?

00:32:09.460 --> 00:32:11.000
If you don't come out,

00:32:11.000 --> 00:32:13.040
you'll be stuck here
with me all night!

00:32:13.130 --> 00:32:14.710
Get the hell out here!

00:32:16.630 --> 00:32:18.040
Remember.

00:32:18.330 --> 00:32:19.460
Come back to me.

00:32:19.500 --> 00:32:20.710
Remember.

00:32:21.170 --> 00:32:22.420
Remember.

00:32:22.420 --> 00:32:23.630
Come back to me.

00:32:23.960 --> 00:32:24.960
Remember.

00:32:25.540 --> 00:32:26.540
Remember.

00:32:27.420 --> 00:32:28.420
Remember.

00:32:29.290 --> 00:32:30.290
Come back to me.

00:32:30.540 --> 00:32:32.000
Remember!

00:32:37.380 --> 00:32:38.380
Alan.

00:32:42.080 --> 00:32:43.080
Alan!

00:32:43.830 --> 00:32:44.830
Are you alright?

00:32:45.380 --> 00:32:46.380
Alan.

00:32:47.460 --> 00:32:48.460
What happened to you?

00:32:51.330 --> 00:32:51.920
Dad?

00:32:51.960 --> 00:32:54.580
How did you end up in the
tub first thing in the morning?

00:32:59.040 --> 00:33:00.920
I guess I sleepwalked in there

00:33:00.960 --> 00:33:01.960
by myself.

00:33:02.750 --> 00:33:03.830
I don't remember.

00:33:11.290 --> 00:33:12.290
What about earlier?

00:33:13.830 --> 00:33:14.830
Any memories?

00:33:19.880 --> 00:33:20.880
Not at all.

00:33:25.170 --> 00:33:27.000
You're not hiding
something from me, are you?

00:33:31.130 --> 00:33:32.130
I'm not.

00:33:34.290 --> 00:33:36.250
You need to let me know
if something happens.

00:33:37.170 --> 00:33:39.880
Don't forget that we're
now undergoing treatment.

00:33:41.040 --> 00:33:42.330
Remember what the doctor said?

00:33:43.960 --> 00:33:45.540
That if we didn't tell the truth,

00:33:46.330 --> 00:33:47.630
then when would you get better?

00:33:51.540 --> 00:33:54.540
Why are you always
thinking that I'm crazy, Dad?

00:33:56.710 --> 00:33:58.420
You always believe
what others say.

00:33:58.540 --> 00:34:00.250
You've never believed me for once.

00:34:07.250 --> 00:34:08.330
I'm sorry

00:34:09.830 --> 00:34:11.380
if I made you feel that way.

00:34:12.880 --> 00:34:15.000
I just didn't want us to keep
secrets from each other.

00:34:16.420 --> 00:34:17.830
I'm worried about you.

00:34:18.040 --> 00:34:19.460
Then, can I ask you

00:34:20.630 --> 00:34:24.040
why the others acted
strangely around me?

00:34:24.670 --> 00:34:26.290
Is there something
I should know?

00:34:27.420 --> 00:34:28.710
Not this again, Alan.

00:34:30.580 --> 00:34:32.380
We've talked about this many times.

00:34:34.830 --> 00:34:36.210
I don't know how to start.

00:34:37.130 --> 00:34:38.380
Same old story, right?

00:34:39.500 --> 00:34:40.750
Did he appear again?

00:34:42.790 --> 00:34:43.790
Yes.

00:34:46.670 --> 00:34:47.670
How did he do it?

00:34:50.420 --> 00:34:51.710
He appeared for a split second,

00:34:52.460 --> 00:34:55.130
but as soon as I turned
around, he was gone.

00:34:58.460 --> 00:34:59.580
Were you scared?

00:35:01.420 --> 00:35:03.500
At first, I was terrified.

00:35:03.500 --> 00:35:05.000
But after some thought,

00:35:06.040 --> 00:35:07.290
I actually got the impression

00:35:08.420 --> 00:35:10.000
that he had been appearing to me

00:35:10.040 --> 00:35:12.290
because he had
some kind of purpose.

00:35:13.750 --> 00:35:14.750
And what did you do?

00:35:15.540 --> 00:35:16.540
So I snapped

00:35:17.040 --> 00:35:18.040
and called him out,

00:35:18.580 --> 00:35:21.080
asking what he wanted
from haunting me.

00:35:21.130 --> 00:35:23.830
I told you it was
just a hallucination.

00:35:25.080 --> 00:35:26.080
But maybe...

00:35:26.670 --> 00:35:28.500
all he wanted to
do was confront me.

00:35:28.540 --> 00:35:30.040
Confront?

00:35:32.040 --> 00:35:33.710
Who did you want to confront, Alan?

00:35:34.630 --> 00:35:36.960
Everything was an
illusion you created.

00:35:37.670 --> 00:35:38.880
If you let go

00:35:40.250 --> 00:35:41.540
and did what the doctor said,

00:35:42.250 --> 00:35:43.670
everything you
saw would be gone.

00:35:43.710 --> 00:35:44.000
But...

00:35:44.040 --> 00:35:45.130
You never helped.

00:35:45.170 --> 00:35:47.710
While everyone was
doing their best to help you,

00:35:47.710 --> 00:35:50.040
you kept obsessing over it.

00:35:51.330 --> 00:35:53.330
We still haven't talk about
what you kept from me.

00:35:55.540 --> 00:35:57.630
And what's going to
happen after I tell you?

00:35:59.040 --> 00:36:00.290
You wouldn't believe me anyway.

00:36:01.170 --> 00:36:02.540
Nobody listens to me.

00:36:04.170 --> 00:36:06.960
Nobody has ever
believed what I think is true.

00:36:07.000 --> 00:36:08.500
And has what you think

00:36:10.460 --> 00:36:12.830
ever made
your condition better?

00:36:15.420 --> 00:36:17.290
Well, if no one's going to listen to me,

00:36:17.500 --> 00:36:19.460
then I'll follow my own thoughts.

00:36:19.830 --> 00:36:21.830
What about everyone's
efforts to help you?

00:36:23.920 --> 00:36:25.540
They never meant
anything to you, right?

00:36:28.960 --> 00:36:30.750
If that old man ghost bullshit

00:36:31.580 --> 00:36:33.420
is keeping you from moving on,

00:36:33.960 --> 00:36:35.380
then you'll never see it again.

00:36:36.670 --> 00:36:37.670
Damn it!

00:36:43.000 --> 00:36:44.210
Where are you going, dad?

00:36:45.170 --> 00:36:46.170
Dad?

00:36:46.170 --> 00:36:47.130
Dad!

00:36:47.170 --> 00:36:48.500
What are you doing, no!

00:36:48.500 --> 00:36:50.000
- No.
- Get off me, Alan.

00:36:58.250 --> 00:36:59.750
What are you doing, Dad?

00:37:00.540 --> 00:37:01.540
Don't do it, dad!

00:37:05.380 --> 00:37:06.380
Dad, don't!

00:37:21.460 --> 00:37:22.460
Alan.

00:37:22.670 --> 00:37:23.670
Alan!

00:37:57.670 --> 00:37:59.130
You up, sleepyhead?

00:38:02.880 --> 00:38:04.210
Who are you?

00:38:09.790 --> 00:38:11.000
You're the new kid, yes?

00:38:19.040 --> 00:38:20.960
Shocked?

00:38:21.330 --> 00:38:22.330
Or...

00:38:23.290 --> 00:38:25.290
Are you stunned by
how handsome I looked?

00:38:31.040 --> 00:38:32.790
You're still dreaming, Alan.

00:38:37.130 --> 00:38:38.290
Did you say something?

00:38:43.460 --> 00:38:45.750
So you think you're
dreaming, huh?

00:38:50.290 --> 00:38:51.290
Dude.

00:38:51.750 --> 00:38:53.210
This is reality, not a dream.

00:38:55.170 --> 00:38:56.580
If this is reality,

00:38:57.500 --> 00:38:58.500
then I should have been lying

00:38:59.420 --> 00:39:00.830
on my own bed.

00:39:08.170 --> 00:39:09.790
Well, if this is a dream,

00:39:11.290 --> 00:39:12.880
that means I'm the
man of your dreams.

00:39:16.790 --> 00:39:17.790
Nah.

00:39:18.000 --> 00:39:19.830
You're probably not
the man of my dreams.

00:39:19.830 --> 00:39:21.750
This is obviously my own dream.

00:39:24.960 --> 00:39:26.460
That hurts.

00:39:27.420 --> 00:39:29.880
You didn't have to turn
me down that hard!

00:39:30.630 --> 00:39:31.630
Mean.

00:39:33.790 --> 00:39:34.790
Meany!

00:39:36.170 --> 00:39:37.420
So mean.

00:39:38.000 --> 00:39:40.500
But this place
really isn't my house.

00:39:44.960 --> 00:39:45.790
Of course it isn't.

00:39:50.790 --> 00:39:53.170
Welcome to the
hospital of the forgotten.

00:39:54.170 --> 00:39:55.170
Huh?

00:39:59.170 --> 00:40:00.460
This place is a hospital?

00:40:01.290 --> 00:40:02.290
Yes sir.

00:40:02.420 --> 00:40:03.420
A hospital.

00:40:04.670 --> 00:40:05.880
Wake up, Alan.

00:40:06.000 --> 00:40:07.670
Time to wake up.

00:40:07.710 --> 00:40:09.710
Wake up, Wake up.

00:40:10.170 --> 00:40:12.080
Stop, you're hurting
yourself for nothing.

00:40:13.330 --> 00:40:14.330
You shut up!

00:40:15.790 --> 00:40:17.250
Giving orders too, huh?

00:40:17.290 --> 00:40:18.830
Cause this is my dream.

00:40:18.830 --> 00:40:20.080
I have to be in control.

00:40:21.750 --> 00:40:23.170
I said this is not a dream!

00:40:25.920 --> 00:40:27.290
If this isn't a dream,

00:40:28.000 --> 00:40:29.000
then you prove it.

00:40:29.540 --> 00:40:30.540
Alright.

00:40:30.880 --> 00:40:32.250
You asked for it.

00:40:40.750 --> 00:40:41.920
What the heck was that?

00:40:43.040 --> 00:40:45.210
A prove that this isn't a dream.

00:40:46.880 --> 00:40:47.880
Jerk.

00:40:48.670 --> 00:40:50.710
People can kiss in their
dream too, you know?

00:40:54.460 --> 00:40:56.380
Then you can think
of that as a free kiss.

00:40:58.420 --> 00:40:59.420
So, how was that?

00:41:00.000 --> 00:41:02.420
Was it more like a
dream or a reality?

00:41:07.790 --> 00:41:09.330
This isn't a dream?

00:41:10.750 --> 00:41:12.540
I told you earlier, but
you didn't believe.

00:41:17.830 --> 00:41:19.210
Then who are you?

00:41:20.460 --> 00:41:21.710
I forgot to introduce myself.

00:41:26.210 --> 00:41:27.330
My name's Win.

00:41:28.000 --> 00:41:29.000
Pleasure to meet you.

00:41:29.000 --> 00:41:30.000
Stop.

00:41:30.830 --> 00:41:31.960
That's enough.

00:41:33.080 --> 00:41:34.750
Don't get any closer.

00:41:35.790 --> 00:41:36.790
Why?

00:41:36.920 --> 00:41:38.040
Afraid you'll get another kiss?

00:41:38.040 --> 00:41:39.290
It's not like that!

00:41:40.040 --> 00:41:41.630
You're a stranger.

00:41:46.040 --> 00:41:47.330
What's your name then?

00:41:51.040 --> 00:41:52.790
- Alan.
- Alan?

00:41:54.000 --> 00:41:55.420
We both know one
other's names now.

00:41:55.710 --> 00:41:56.830
Guess we're no
strangers anymore.

00:42:01.210 --> 00:42:03.250
Isn't that a bit too easy?

00:42:08.330 --> 00:42:10.420
Or...you want me
to kiss you again?

00:42:10.460 --> 00:42:12.170
Stop right there.

00:42:12.330 --> 00:42:13.790
Fine, we're not strangers.

00:42:25.670 --> 00:42:26.790
Then this place...

00:42:30.920 --> 00:42:32.040
is a hospital?

00:42:33.920 --> 00:42:35.330
Mm-hmm, yeah.

00:42:38.420 --> 00:42:40.000
The hospital of
the forgotten ones.

00:42:44.330 --> 00:42:46.040
How did we get here?

00:42:48.170 --> 00:42:50.130
Probably the same as
the other patient here.

00:42:53.880 --> 00:42:55.830
Someone brought us here

00:42:57.460 --> 00:42:58.880
and forgot that we were here.

00:43:08.000 --> 00:43:09.000
Alan.

00:43:09.380 --> 00:43:10.380
Alan.
