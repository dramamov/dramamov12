WEBVTT

00:00:00.630 --> 00:00:02.000
He's here too?

00:00:02.130 --> 00:00:02.700
No way.

00:00:02.830 --> 00:00:04.000
For real?

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:15.970
What a rare sight.

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:18.000
Hayama, at an audition?

00:00:18.130 --> 00:00:19.130
Sakuma, you're here too.

00:00:19.270 --> 00:00:20.530
Yeah.

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:23.530
You're in the same boat.

00:00:24.530 --> 00:00:26.070
Looks that way.

00:00:27.870 --> 00:00:28.970
Yes.

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:34.530
Honda.

00:00:35.770 --> 00:00:38.200
Huh? It's Sakuma.

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:40.300
What do you mean, "huh?"

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:41.130
You guys know each other?

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:41.800
Yeah.

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:44.200
We used to run into each other at auditions all the time.

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:45.500
For a while, every audition I went to...

00:00:45.630 --> 00:00:47.430
we'd end up seeing each other like this.

00:00:47.530 --> 00:00:50.770
So you're a rival of Sakuma-san's?

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:53.530
Uh...

00:00:53.870 --> 00:00:55.700
I guess you could say that.

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:57.700
But if you're going to put it that way...

00:00:57.830 --> 00:00:59.300
then we all are.

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:02.770
Everyone here is a rival.

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:09.200
Anyway, let's both do our best.

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:10.570
Honda.

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:26.770
- Um...
- Sorry to keep you all waiting.

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:28.530
Now, if everyone could please move to the audition room.

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:30.000
Yes.

00:01:30.970 --> 00:01:32.200
Okay.

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:50.330
"At 25:00, in Akasaka" Season 2
(Episode 4)

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:47.970
I will now explain the scene you'll be performing.

00:02:48.270 --> 00:02:49.930
Having killed the real Muroga Jun...

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:51.870
the protagonist takes his place.

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:54.670
His real name is Nakamura Yusaku.

00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:57.330
However, one day,
a man who knows the protagonist's past...

00:02:57.470 --> 00:03:00.300
a man named Fukuyama, arrives from Tokyo.

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:05.630
This scene is where Fukuyama confronts Muroga
about his crimes.

00:03:05.770 --> 00:03:08.430
The acting evaluation will be conducted
in pairs according to your number.

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:09.800
We'll be calling you in order.

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:12.300
Please check your number.

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:16.800
Let the evaluations begin.

00:03:19.630 --> 00:03:21.630
I know everything.

00:03:21.770 --> 00:03:23.970
Don't pretend you don't know what I'm talking about.

00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:26.930
I don't know what you're talking about.

00:03:27.700 --> 00:03:29.470
I don't know.

00:03:29.570 --> 00:03:30.370
It wasn't me.

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:32.170
It was you, Muroga.

00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:34.330
No.

00:03:35.070 --> 00:03:37.200
Nakamura Yusaku.

00:03:40.770 --> 00:03:42.170
I knew it.

00:03:42.300 --> 00:03:44.000
You're the one who killed Muroga.

00:03:44.130 --> 00:03:47.000
I don't understand what you mean.

00:03:47.130 --> 00:03:49.870
You and Muroga were rivals, weren't you?

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:51.030
That's not it.

00:03:51.170 --> 00:03:53.700
Muroga was always one step ahead of you.

00:03:54.530 --> 00:03:57.530
So you always saw him as a threat.

00:03:57.670 --> 00:04:00.700
You were annoyed, envious,
and even wanted him dead.

00:04:00.830 --> 00:04:01.700
No.

00:04:01.830 --> 00:04:03.570
I never thought that.

00:04:03.700 --> 00:04:05.870
You're not gentle at all.

00:04:06.330 --> 00:04:10.330
You're actually a cunning,
cold, and despicable person.

00:04:10.470 --> 00:04:12.970
That's why you killed him and took his place, isn't it?

00:04:17.070 --> 00:04:18.500
You too?

00:04:20.170 --> 00:04:22.370
Are you also here to get in my way?

00:04:23.430 --> 00:04:24.700
If that's the case...

00:04:26.470 --> 00:04:28.430
Okay, thank you both.

00:04:29.970 --> 00:04:32.500
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

00:04:43.270 --> 00:04:45.070
Next group, please.

00:04:50.530 --> 00:04:53.330
I know everything.

00:04:54.430 --> 00:04:57.000
Stop pretending you don't know.

00:05:02.530 --> 00:05:05.870
I don't know what you're talking about.

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:07.500
I don't know.

00:05:08.500 --> 00:05:11.300
- It wasn't me.
- It was you, Muroga.

00:05:12.130 --> 00:05:13.500
No.

00:05:14.470 --> 00:05:17.000
Nakamura Yusaku.

00:05:19.870 --> 00:05:21.870
I knew it.

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:23.570
You killed him.

00:05:23.700 --> 00:05:26.330
You killed the real Muroga Jun.

00:05:27.830 --> 00:05:30.700
I don't understand.

00:05:30.830 --> 00:05:33.970
You and Muroga were rivals, right?

00:05:35.330 --> 00:05:36.970
That's not it.

00:05:37.470 --> 00:05:41.000
Muroga was always one step ahead of you.

00:05:41.130 --> 00:05:44.530
So you always saw him as a threat.

00:05:45.530 --> 00:05:47.430
Annoyed...

00:05:49.630 --> 00:05:51.800
envious...

00:05:53.370 --> 00:05:55.930
and even wanted him dead.

00:05:56.030 --> 00:05:57.300
No.

00:06:00.270 --> 00:06:01.800
I never thought that.

00:06:01.930 --> 00:06:04.330
You're not gentle at all.

00:06:04.570 --> 00:06:07.430
You're actually a cunning,
cold, and despicable person.

00:06:07.530 --> 00:06:08.800
That's why...

00:06:09.130 --> 00:06:11.970
you killed him and took his place, isn't it?

00:06:21.800 --> 00:06:23.200
You too?

00:06:26.830 --> 00:06:29.430
Are you also here to get in my way?

00:06:30.500 --> 00:06:31.830
In that case...

00:06:32.470 --> 00:06:34.770
Okay, thank you both.

00:06:35.800 --> 00:06:37.330
Hayama-san.

00:06:38.370 --> 00:06:42.800
That part in the beginning where you tried to
brush it off with a smile...

00:06:43.500 --> 00:06:46.770
really brought out the cunning nature
of Nakamura Yusaku.

00:06:47.700 --> 00:06:50.800
I thought that was excellent.

00:06:52.200 --> 00:06:53.130
Thank you very much.

00:06:53.270 --> 00:06:54.670
No, thank you.

00:07:02.870 --> 00:07:04.270
Enjoy your meal.

00:07:04.970 --> 00:07:06.370
What the heck?

00:07:06.500 --> 00:07:08.000
Why was I the only one who didn't get it?

00:07:08.130 --> 00:07:09.500
How long are you going to keep this up?

00:07:09.630 --> 00:07:11.200
I'm so frustrated.

00:07:11.330 --> 00:07:12.970
- I'm the only one who lost.
- Come on...

00:07:13.070 --> 00:07:14.700
There's no winning or losing in an audition.

00:07:14.830 --> 00:07:16.130
It's about whether you're right for the role.

00:07:16.270 --> 00:07:17.430
And your chemistry with the other actors.

00:07:17.530 --> 00:07:19.470
It's a combination of all those factors.

00:07:19.570 --> 00:07:21.630
I know all that in theory.

00:07:22.370 --> 00:07:24.130
But it still sucks.

00:07:25.800 --> 00:07:27.170
What's wrong?

00:07:27.300 --> 00:07:30.330
Oh, it's nothing. Just remembered something.

00:07:30.830 --> 00:07:32.500
What is it?

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:34.830
Remember Honda?

00:07:36.070 --> 00:07:38.000
The one I did the scene with today.

00:07:38.130 --> 00:07:39.370
Right.

00:07:39.500 --> 00:07:41.370
We competed against each other in auditions many times.

00:07:41.500 --> 00:07:43.170
Sometimes I'd get the part...

00:07:43.300 --> 00:07:45.670
and sometimes he would.

00:07:47.830 --> 00:07:49.500
Once, at an audition for a certain project...

00:07:49.630 --> 00:07:50.870
I was the one who got chosen.

00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:53.830
But it never sat right with me.

00:07:54.470 --> 00:07:56.030
Why?

00:07:57.130 --> 00:08:00.470
Because I saw Honda's performance at the audition...

00:08:00.570 --> 00:08:03.370
and I thought he was so much better than me.

00:08:07.930 --> 00:08:10.930
It's a world without clear winners or losers.

00:08:11.030 --> 00:08:12.800
That makes it tough, doesn't it?

00:08:12.930 --> 00:08:16.000
After all, what's considered "good" is subjective.

00:08:16.130 --> 00:08:19.370
Exactly. There's no absolute right or wrong.

00:08:19.500 --> 00:08:20.870
No real wins or losses.

00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:24.570
So it makes you wonder...
what you should hold onto to keep going.

00:08:24.700 --> 00:08:28.200
Sakuma, what keeps you going?

00:08:28.670 --> 00:08:31.700
I don't know. But for me...

00:08:32.070 --> 00:08:34.200
it's not that I'm thinking...

00:08:34.800 --> 00:08:37.070
"I have to beat Hayama."

00:08:39.200 --> 00:08:41.630
Or Shirasaki, or Yamase.

00:08:41.770 --> 00:08:44.030
I've never thought about beating any of you.

00:08:44.700 --> 00:08:46.370
But...

00:08:46.700 --> 00:08:49.200
I don't want to lose either.

00:08:53.070 --> 00:08:55.500
Sorry, that was random. Here.

00:08:55.630 --> 00:08:56.700
Drink up.

00:08:56.830 --> 00:08:58.370
Then it's your treat today.

00:08:58.500 --> 00:09:00.300
Yeah, yeah, I know.

00:09:00.430 --> 00:09:01.370
Alright...

00:09:02.130 --> 00:09:04.200
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

00:09:09.030 --> 00:09:11.630
Why didn't I get the part?

00:09:20.800 --> 00:09:22.200
Asami-san.

00:09:25.530 --> 00:09:27.070
Hmm?

00:09:29.670 --> 00:09:32.130
Until this audition is over...

00:09:32.530 --> 00:09:34.930
should we maybe keep some distance?

00:09:42.770 --> 00:09:44.930
I want to keep our distance for now.

00:09:47.200 --> 00:09:49.630
Let's try not to see each other.

00:09:49.770 --> 00:09:52.470
Even for meals...

00:09:52.570 --> 00:09:54.870
we should eat in our own rooms.

00:10:00.930 --> 00:10:03.470
Isn't that basically like living separately?

00:10:03.570 --> 00:10:04.930
We only just started living together.

00:10:05.030 --> 00:10:07.130
No, it's not forever.

00:10:07.270 --> 00:10:08.870
Just until the audition is over.

00:10:10.430 --> 00:10:12.070
Sakuma-san said it too.

00:10:12.700 --> 00:10:15.830
We are, for all intents and purposes, rivals.

00:10:18.300 --> 00:10:19.870
Rivals.

00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:22.500
At least, that's the mindset I want to have.

00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:29.330
I want to catch up to you,
Asami-san, as quickly as I can.

00:10:31.430 --> 00:10:33.930
Regardless of the audition's outcome...

00:10:34.370 --> 00:10:37.030
I want to be able to stand beside you
with my head held high.

00:10:39.270 --> 00:10:43.770
I can't just... switch gears that easily.

00:10:44.570 --> 00:10:45.930
If things stay as they are...

00:10:46.030 --> 00:10:48.700
I might end up just relying on you.

00:11:05.770 --> 00:11:07.270
I understand.

00:11:09.470 --> 00:11:11.870
If that's what you want, Shirasaki...

00:11:12.770 --> 00:11:14.130
then let's do it that way.

00:11:18.570 --> 00:11:20.370
Thank you.

00:11:20.700 --> 00:11:22.030
Asami-san.

00:11:50.930 --> 00:11:52.200
Well then...

00:11:53.070 --> 00:11:54.500
Good night.

00:11:56.670 --> 00:11:58.270
Asami-san.

00:12:03.200 --> 00:12:05.270
I don't want to lose to you, Asami-san.

00:12:12.770 --> 00:12:14.430
Asami-san...

00:12:17.030 --> 00:12:18.530
What are you thinking?

00:12:25.130 --> 00:12:26.300
It's nothing.

00:12:26.430 --> 00:12:28.070
Never mind.

00:12:28.370 --> 00:12:29.970
Good night.

00:13:02.130 --> 00:13:03.570
Morning.

00:13:04.170 --> 00:13:05.800
I'm heading out for work.

00:13:33.770 --> 00:13:36.000
Is there any point to this?

00:13:53.470 --> 00:13:56.170
I want to touch Shirasaki.

00:13:59.300 --> 00:14:01.870
It's been so long. I just want to touch him.

00:14:18.470 --> 00:14:19.570
Ta-da!

00:14:20.870 --> 00:14:23.700
I heard that for this brand's
new campaign...

00:14:23.830 --> 00:14:26.470
Shirasaki's name is on the list of candidates.

00:14:26.570 --> 00:14:28.370
- Huh? Me?
- Yep.

00:14:30.200 --> 00:14:31.300
The spokesperson for this brand...

00:14:31.430 --> 00:14:33.570
Asami-san used to be it, right?

00:14:33.700 --> 00:14:35.130
That's right.

00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:42.130
The person in charge also said...

00:14:42.270 --> 00:14:44.870
that when Hayama was the face of the brand,
it was a huge sensation.

00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:47.200
They said sales went up quite a bit.

00:14:50.700 --> 00:14:54.070
Being the spokesperson for the same ad as Hayama-san.

00:14:57.130 --> 00:14:58.130
If I actually get the part,

00:14:58.270 --> 00:15:00.070
the pressure would be insane, right?

00:15:00.700 --> 00:15:01.770
Huh?

00:15:01.870 --> 00:15:04.530
Because we'd definitely be compared.

00:15:04.870 --> 00:15:07.330
You're amazing too, Shirasaki.

00:15:07.930 --> 00:15:09.700
I don't think you'd lose.

00:15:13.470 --> 00:15:15.030
Thank you.

00:15:16.830 --> 00:15:18.430
Shinoda-san.

00:15:19.130 --> 00:15:21.270
I want this job.

00:15:23.300 --> 00:15:26.530
Let's work together and make you the spokesperson.

00:15:26.670 --> 00:15:28.430
- Yes.
- Mm-hmm.

00:15:32.970 --> 00:15:34.070
Okay.

00:15:40.570 --> 00:15:42.800
Look who's here. How long has it been?

00:15:42.930 --> 00:15:45.700
It's rare to see you here for a drink, Hayama.

00:15:45.830 --> 00:15:46.870
Sorry for coming before you opened.

00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:50.300
It's fine. I'll just be sure to charge you
the after-hours fee.

00:15:52.130 --> 00:15:53.830
That sounds expensive.

00:15:54.570 --> 00:15:56.870
I'll have a drink, too.

00:16:02.470 --> 00:16:03.300
Mihara.

00:16:03.430 --> 00:16:04.530
Yeah?

00:16:04.670 --> 00:16:06.530
Is there anyone you want to beat?

00:16:06.670 --> 00:16:07.630
Huh?

00:16:07.770 --> 00:16:09.370
Where did that come from?

00:16:09.700 --> 00:16:11.030
Well...

00:16:11.470 --> 00:16:12.870
Just wondering.

00:16:14.930 --> 00:16:16.630
Sure.

00:16:17.870 --> 00:16:19.170
- You do?
- Yeah.

00:16:20.270 --> 00:16:22.800
I want to beat the people who look down on me.

00:16:22.930 --> 00:16:25.300
Or anyone who gives me a hard time.

00:16:25.430 --> 00:16:26.700
I want to crush them completely.

00:16:26.830 --> 00:16:29.200
Beat them so badly they're left speechless.

00:16:30.930 --> 00:16:32.470
That's so you.

00:16:33.770 --> 00:16:35.000
Then...

00:16:35.130 --> 00:16:36.670
Is there anyone you "don't" want to lose to?

00:16:36.800 --> 00:16:38.800
Huh? What was that?

00:16:38.930 --> 00:16:39.570
What do you mean?

00:16:39.700 --> 00:16:41.300
Didn't I just answer that?

00:16:43.530 --> 00:16:45.670
Someone you want to beat.

00:16:45.800 --> 00:16:48.500
Is that the same as someone you don't want to lose to?

00:16:48.630 --> 00:16:50.070
Or is it different?

00:16:50.200 --> 00:16:51.530
Oh, that's what you mean.

00:16:52.930 --> 00:16:54.670
Hmm...

00:16:55.000 --> 00:16:57.500
What's the difference, anyway?

00:17:01.370 --> 00:17:03.330
I guess it's like this.

00:17:04.370 --> 00:17:06.500
- This is me.
- And...

00:17:07.770 --> 00:17:09.870
"Wanting to win"...

00:17:10.970 --> 00:17:12.500
is like this.

00:17:13.170 --> 00:17:15.000
"Wanting to win" is about surpassing them.

00:17:15.130 --> 00:17:17.930
Wanting to be stronger, to stand above them.

00:17:18.630 --> 00:17:22.200
And then, not wanting to lose...

00:17:24.300 --> 00:17:27.170
is about wanting to be their equal.

00:17:30.570 --> 00:17:32.270
Their equal.

00:17:34.330 --> 00:17:36.630
I want to catch up to Asami-san.

00:17:44.430 --> 00:17:45.800
Mihara.

00:17:46.770 --> 00:17:48.170
Thank you.

00:17:49.630 --> 00:17:51.170
I don't really know what that was about,

00:17:51.300 --> 00:17:52.800
but you're welcome.

00:18:01.700 --> 00:18:03.830
Huh? Leaving already?

00:18:05.200 --> 00:18:06.500
Don't worry about it.

00:18:06.630 --> 00:18:09.170
That drink I gave you...
was a cocktail I was practicing.

00:18:09.300 --> 00:18:10.430
Oh.

00:18:11.170 --> 00:18:12.330
Was it?

00:18:12.470 --> 00:18:14.530
I used you as a guinea pig.

00:18:14.670 --> 00:18:16.000
So it's on the house.

00:18:17.430 --> 00:18:19.470
You haven't changed a bit, Mihara.

00:18:20.130 --> 00:18:22.800
Is that a compliment or an insult?

00:18:23.300 --> 00:18:24.700
The former.

00:18:25.470 --> 00:18:26.830
Of course.

00:18:27.870 --> 00:18:30.430
Then I'll take you up on that.

00:18:30.630 --> 00:18:32.130
Thanks for the drink.

00:18:34.130 --> 00:18:36.170
You, on the other hand, have changed, Hayama.

00:18:38.500 --> 00:18:40.470
Uh...

00:18:40.570 --> 00:18:42.200
In what way?

00:18:43.200 --> 00:18:44.770
You've become human.

00:18:47.700 --> 00:18:49.500
I've always been human.

00:18:49.630 --> 00:18:52.330
I mean you seem more human now.

00:18:52.630 --> 00:18:54.270
It's a good thing.

00:19:01.670 --> 00:19:03.270
If you ask me.

00:19:03.370 --> 00:19:05.000
Excuse me...

00:19:09.000 --> 00:19:10.500
Shirasaki.

00:19:21.770 --> 00:19:23.030
Welcome back.

00:19:25.930 --> 00:19:27.370
I... I'm home.

00:19:27.930 --> 00:19:29.470
I know.

00:19:30.130 --> 00:19:32.270
We have to keep our distance, right?

00:19:32.630 --> 00:19:33.830
Yeah.

00:19:35.870 --> 00:19:37.570
There's just one thing

00:19:37.800 --> 00:19:40.470
I want to tell you.

00:19:43.300 --> 00:19:45.270
Just let me say it.

00:19:50.270 --> 00:19:51.570
It's the same for me.

00:19:52.630 --> 00:19:55.670
I don't want to lose to you either.

00:19:59.500 --> 00:20:01.070
Shirasaki.

00:20:01.200 --> 00:20:04.630
You might feel like you're always chasing me,

00:20:05.300 --> 00:20:07.000
but the truth is, it's the same for me.

00:20:08.030 --> 00:20:09.670
I'm also...

00:20:09.970 --> 00:20:12.430
always chasing you.

00:20:25.170 --> 00:20:26.800
I...

00:20:28.700 --> 00:20:31.830
I've always admired you, Asami-san.

00:20:32.770 --> 00:20:36.630
No, I thought you were incredible.

00:20:38.170 --> 00:20:39.770
Completely unreachable.

00:20:42.270 --> 00:20:44.570
But I always hoped that one day I could catch up.

00:20:45.470 --> 00:20:47.770
To stand by your side as an equal.

00:20:50.200 --> 00:20:51.830
So...

00:20:53.330 --> 00:20:55.570
even if you're lying

00:20:55.700 --> 00:20:57.800
about not wanting to lose to me,

00:20:57.930 --> 00:20:59.370
I'm still happy.

00:21:00.430 --> 00:21:02.030
I'm not lying.

00:21:02.570 --> 00:21:03.930
Huh?

00:21:05.130 --> 00:21:06.800
I've said it before.

00:21:06.930 --> 00:21:09.330
The reason I'm able to do this job now

00:21:09.470 --> 00:21:11.330
is all because of you.

00:21:18.330 --> 00:21:19.970
Asami-san...

00:21:24.830 --> 00:21:27.170
I made it to the final round of auditions.

00:21:39.830 --> 00:21:41.300
Congratulations.

00:21:43.370 --> 00:21:45.030
Asami-san.

00:21:45.870 --> 00:21:47.270
Me too.

00:21:48.800 --> 00:21:50.530
I made it too.

00:21:53.470 --> 00:21:55.470
Congratulations.

00:21:56.930 --> 00:21:58.930
But of course you did.

00:21:59.030 --> 00:22:00.470
You're Hayama Asami, after all.

00:22:06.770 --> 00:22:08.170
So now,

00:22:08.700 --> 00:22:12.530
we're officially rivals.

00:22:15.270 --> 00:22:16.700
Yes.

00:22:19.470 --> 00:22:20.970
But.

00:22:21.470 --> 00:22:23.330
Nothing will change.

00:22:25.000 --> 00:22:27.130
No matter the outcome.

00:22:27.530 --> 00:22:29.570
Between you and me,

00:22:30.300 --> 00:22:32.030
nothing will change.

00:22:37.270 --> 00:22:38.670
Okay.

00:22:50.130 --> 00:22:52.630
Sorry for calling you out here so suddenly.

00:22:52.770 --> 00:22:53.770
It's fine.

00:22:53.870 --> 00:22:55.570
Did something happen?

00:23:10.930 --> 00:23:12.630
Hayama.

00:23:13.370 --> 00:23:14.830
There's something I need to ask you.

00:23:14.970 --> 00:23:17.130
This audition...

00:23:22.000 --> 00:23:24.000
I need you to drop out.

00:23:26.430 --> 00:23:29.300
(This is a work of fiction.)

00:23:29.970 --> 00:23:34.170
(Next Episode)
I... want to see this audition through to the end.

00:23:34.300 --> 00:23:36.170
For your career,

00:23:36.300 --> 00:23:38.770
this is a critical turning point.

00:23:38.870 --> 00:23:41.130
I hope you'll lend me your strength, Hayama-san.

00:23:41.270 --> 00:23:43.700
If the job you want to do

00:23:43.830 --> 00:23:45.970
conflicts with the job you should do,

00:23:46.070 --> 00:23:47.530
what would you do, Sakuma?

00:23:47.670 --> 00:23:49.070
I think you have a choice.

00:23:49.200 --> 00:23:51.630
The choice to do what you really want, Hayama.

00:23:51.970 --> 00:23:53.270
Akeno-san.

00:23:53.370 --> 00:23:56.830
I... The audition results are in.

00:23:56.970 --> 00:23:58.930
Can I sleep with you tonight?
