00:00:06.678 --> 00:00:08.713
This apartment is our target's home.

00:00:09.380 --> 00:00:12.584
I want to park the truck here,
but it can't be there for too long.

00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:16.087
So I'm eyeing this park instead.

00:00:16.688 --> 00:00:20.692
Shinoda, I want you and Suzaki to pretend
to be a flirty couple.

00:00:22.026 --> 00:00:22.861
What?!

00:00:23.461 --> 00:00:26.798
A guy by himself invites suspicion
and may get questioned.

00:00:27.332 --> 00:00:29.400
He could always refuse to answer.

00:00:29.467 --> 00:00:32.036
But then he draws even more suspicion.

00:00:32.637 --> 00:00:34.172
Have you been questioned?

00:00:34.239 --> 00:00:35.573
No, I haven't.

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:37.542
The officer checks your ID.

00:00:37.609 --> 00:00:39.511
Yeah, I do know that.

00:00:40.311 --> 00:00:42.480
Are we about to do something illegal?

00:00:42.547 --> 00:00:43.848
Nothing that bad.

00:00:43.915 --> 00:00:45.583
Just taking some sneak shots.

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:47.118
Sneak shots?

00:00:47.185 --> 00:00:50.288
A different team was on this story.

00:00:50.355 --> 00:00:52.590
Yutaka Takagi and Kirari.

00:00:53.892 --> 00:00:55.126
-What?
-Who?

00:00:55.193 --> 00:00:56.060
You know them?

00:00:56.127 --> 00:00:58.796
Kirari is a former idol turned influencer.

00:00:58.863 --> 00:01:00.632
Her video streams are famous.

00:01:01.232 --> 00:01:02.100
I see.

00:01:02.167 --> 00:01:05.003
Her channel's subscriber amount is…

00:01:05.603 --> 00:01:06.804
-Three thousand?
-That's it?

00:01:06.871 --> 00:01:08.840
She's an influencer, right?

00:01:08.907 --> 00:01:10.241
A budding influencer.

00:01:10.308 --> 00:01:11.476
I've never heard of that.

00:01:11.543 --> 00:01:15.980
"Influencer" means they have influence,
what influence does a bud have?

00:01:16.047 --> 00:01:19.851
That's like saying there's an experienced
newcomer or new building with history.

00:01:19.918 --> 00:01:21.286
-So picky.
-Sorry.

00:01:21.352 --> 00:01:23.922
And Yutaka Takagi is a former Blue Ranger.

00:01:23.988 --> 00:01:24.856
No, Yellow.

00:01:24.923 --> 00:01:26.491
No, Blue. Right?

00:01:26.558 --> 00:01:29.060
-I think it was Green.
-Definitely not Green.

00:01:29.127 --> 00:01:30.495
Don't look it up!

00:01:30.562 --> 00:01:32.297
Let's bet on it!

00:01:32.363 --> 00:01:34.299
I think it's blue. You, Shinoda?

00:01:34.365 --> 00:01:36.267
It's definitely Yellow.

00:01:36.334 --> 00:01:37.302
Look, who cares.

00:01:37.368 --> 00:01:39.637
-Get back on topic.
-Right. Sorry.

00:01:40.271 --> 00:01:44.142
We got word that Yutaka Takagi
and Kirari both have the day off.

00:01:44.776 --> 00:01:46.711
We might catch them sleeping over.

00:01:48.546 --> 00:01:51.783
This would be so much easier to get
from a car.

00:01:51.849 --> 00:01:54.352
Maybe they're not that careful,
they're not big celebrities.

00:01:54.419 --> 00:01:55.920
That's a good point.

00:01:55.987 --> 00:01:59.591
The story's tiny,
but it could be good experience.

00:01:59.657 --> 00:02:00.792
Nice.

00:02:00.858 --> 00:02:02.961
Your first step as a journalist.

00:02:06.197 --> 00:02:08.233
Don't look so worried.

00:02:08.299 --> 00:02:09.434
You got this.

00:02:10.435 --> 00:02:11.536
What's your cover?

00:02:11.603 --> 00:02:14.472
-A normal couple.
-You snuck out of a party.

00:02:14.539 --> 00:02:15.673
That's a good one.

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:17.609
Maybe a jacket for Suzaki.

00:02:17.675 --> 00:02:19.344
And a gaudy Hawaiian shirt.

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:20.478
That's weird.

00:02:20.545 --> 00:02:23.648
Shinoda will be in
a go-getter party dress.

00:02:23.715 --> 00:02:24.782
It'd be like this.

00:02:24.849 --> 00:02:26.784
A skirt with a fancy blouse.

00:02:27.418 --> 00:02:28.820
Go buy that now.

00:02:28.886 --> 00:02:29.854
It'll be covered.

00:02:29.921 --> 00:02:32.090
Nice, you're getting free clothes.

00:02:32.991 --> 00:02:34.592
Okay, meeting adjourned.

00:02:34.659 --> 00:02:36.160
You guys know your jobs.

00:02:36.227 --> 00:02:37.462
-Got it.
-Yes, sir.

00:02:37.528 --> 00:02:38.429
Wait.

00:02:38.496 --> 00:02:40.598
Just don't look like a journalist.

00:02:41.599 --> 00:02:43.134
It's a tiny article, so no worries.

00:02:43.901 --> 00:02:47.805
An outfit to trick an up-and-coming
influencer and the Blue Ranger.

00:02:47.872 --> 00:02:48.740
Yellow!

00:02:48.806 --> 00:02:49.641
Blue!

00:02:49.707 --> 00:02:52.010
-I think it's Green.
-Definitely not Green.

00:02:52.076 --> 00:02:54.345
-Look it up, you're wrong.
-What?

00:02:55.847 --> 00:02:56.814
Look it up.

00:02:57.715 --> 00:02:58.916
I don't care.

00:03:02.987 --> 00:03:03.821
Tiny.

00:03:05.857 --> 00:03:06.791
Tiny?

00:03:23.608 --> 00:03:25.710
I found myself in the park

00:03:26.878 --> 00:03:28.646
before I was mentally prepared.

00:03:30.882 --> 00:03:31.749
Let's go.

00:03:35.186 --> 00:03:37.388
Urged I could do it
because it was a tiny story,

00:03:38.323 --> 00:03:40.058
I was made to wear this outfit,

00:03:41.092 --> 00:03:43.194
and got caught in the momentum.

00:03:43.261 --> 00:03:47.699
I'm just hoping I don't get too drunk.

00:03:50.301 --> 00:03:51.369
-Shinoda.
-Yes?

00:03:51.436 --> 00:03:53.271
Try not to drink.

00:03:53.338 --> 00:03:54.172
Huh?

00:03:54.939 --> 00:03:56.874
It's just for blending it.

00:03:58.109 --> 00:03:59.811
I can't help it, since it's in my hand,

00:03:59.877 --> 00:04:01.179
You can't get drunk.

00:04:03.481 --> 00:04:04.315
Also,

00:04:05.983 --> 00:04:08.386
can you act more like
you're having a fun time?

00:04:10.054 --> 00:04:11.022
Sorry.

00:04:23.034 --> 00:04:25.436
-So that's how it works.
-Don't peek.

00:04:26.237 --> 00:04:27.605
Who knows who's watching.

00:04:28.106 --> 00:04:29.006
Sorry.

00:04:35.079 --> 00:04:37.482
What do you usually talk about
during these times?

00:04:38.182 --> 00:04:40.885
I'm usually on my own,
so I don't have to chat.

00:04:42.019 --> 00:04:42.920
I see.

00:04:48.059 --> 00:04:50.328
I should probably use the swing.

00:04:50.395 --> 00:04:51.729
You don't need to.

00:04:52.263 --> 00:04:55.299
You don't need to do anything special,
just act natural.

00:04:57.735 --> 00:04:58.603
Okay.

00:05:02.940 --> 00:05:05.610
I should've brought a deck of cards
or something.

00:05:06.210 --> 00:05:08.279
But maybe not.

00:05:12.083 --> 00:05:13.985
What's your favorite equipment?

00:05:15.787 --> 00:05:16.621
What?

00:05:16.687 --> 00:05:19.524
For playgrounds. I like slides.

00:05:21.726 --> 00:05:22.994
Never thought about it.

00:05:24.395 --> 00:05:25.663
That makes sense.

00:05:29.700 --> 00:05:33.137
It's a pretty big place for Takagi
to live alone.

00:05:33.838 --> 00:05:36.140
Maybe they already live together.

00:05:38.609 --> 00:05:39.477
Maybe.

00:05:40.311 --> 00:05:42.880
I wonder how much rent is here.

00:05:45.683 --> 00:05:48.119
Don't you wonder
what the purchase price is?

00:05:50.188 --> 00:05:51.989
Is there a supermarket nearby?

00:06:10.074 --> 00:06:11.976
Could you be talking?

00:06:12.977 --> 00:06:14.679
I thought I was annoying you.

00:06:14.745 --> 00:06:18.649
You can't be too loud,
but it's weird if you're silent.

00:06:19.951 --> 00:06:21.285
You're right.

00:06:31.529 --> 00:06:32.630
What's your hobby?

00:06:36.100 --> 00:06:37.735
How do you feel?

00:06:38.703 --> 00:06:39.537
About what?

00:06:39.604 --> 00:06:43.174
Your pictures could ruin someone's life.

00:06:47.178 --> 00:06:49.780
It's the chief's decision
to publish it or not.

00:06:50.781 --> 00:06:52.517
Yamabuki said the same thing.

00:06:55.720 --> 00:06:58.089
I'm not doing this because I want to.

00:06:59.223 --> 00:07:01.726
I can't be picky if I want to eat.

00:07:03.027 --> 00:07:04.295
You're right.

00:07:04.362 --> 00:07:08.132
You're supposed to give me some
words of encouragement here!

00:07:08.199 --> 00:07:09.600
You're my client in this.

00:07:10.701 --> 00:07:12.036
I am?

00:07:12.103 --> 00:07:14.238
I'm exclusive, but a freelancer.

00:07:14.305 --> 00:07:16.340
But you're a Sengokusha employee.

00:07:17.408 --> 00:07:20.478
I work for the Sengoku Weekly
editing department.

00:07:21.145 --> 00:07:21.979
That's true.

00:07:22.580 --> 00:07:25.249
No point in asking my opinion
about taking secret pictures,

00:07:25.316 --> 00:07:27.184
or worrying about what we do.

00:07:27.952 --> 00:07:30.922
Your job is to support me and make sure

00:07:30.988 --> 00:07:35.326
the local residents or the police
don't find me suspicious.

00:07:36.160 --> 00:07:36.994
I'm sorry.

00:07:47.872 --> 00:07:48.739
They're here.

00:08:14.465 --> 00:08:15.466
What's wrong?

00:08:16.167 --> 00:08:17.168
Nothing.

00:08:28.846 --> 00:08:30.114
Did you get it?

00:08:30.181 --> 00:08:31.916
Got the money shot.

00:08:32.617 --> 00:08:33.818
It's them all right.

00:08:34.418 --> 00:08:35.353
Good work.

00:08:36.253 --> 00:08:38.322
-Now then.
-Time to go home.

00:08:38.889 --> 00:08:40.291
This is where it begins.

00:08:40.358 --> 00:08:41.158
Huh?

00:08:41.225 --> 00:08:42.893
We catch them coming out.

00:08:42.960 --> 00:08:44.228
Time is important.

00:08:44.295 --> 00:08:46.964
If she leaves right away,
it's not much of a scandal.

00:08:47.698 --> 00:08:50.901
Okay, we're in this for the long game.

00:09:01.812 --> 00:09:03.414
My heart's still racing.

00:09:04.582 --> 00:09:06.150
What is this feeling?

00:09:07.051 --> 00:09:08.052
Is it the scoop?

00:09:09.787 --> 00:09:10.855
Or the alcohol?

00:09:10.921 --> 00:09:11.822
No.

00:09:12.723 --> 00:09:14.558
Is it because of the hug?

00:09:16.761 --> 00:09:17.828
That can't be it.

00:09:18.396 --> 00:09:21.399
Yes, I can't remember
the last time I was hugged,

00:09:22.133 --> 00:09:27.171
but it must be my anxiety over
a potential police questioning.

00:09:30.541 --> 00:09:32.510
Crap, one really showed up.

00:09:33.110 --> 00:09:34.779
Why this timing?

00:09:36.080 --> 00:09:36.981
We locked eyes.

00:09:38.282 --> 00:09:39.483
I looked away!

00:09:40.184 --> 00:09:41.886
Why did I do that?

00:09:46.290 --> 00:09:47.158
Yup, he's coming.

00:09:47.224 --> 00:09:48.759
This sucks.

00:09:51.195 --> 00:09:52.997
What do I do? Hold on.

00:09:53.064 --> 00:09:55.800
I have no idea what to do
about the questioning.

00:09:56.534 --> 00:09:57.935
If I mess this up…

00:09:59.103 --> 00:10:00.171
Mr. Suzaki.

00:10:00.237 --> 00:10:02.707
Come back from the bathroom!

00:10:04.642 --> 00:10:05.576
You there.

00:10:07.311 --> 00:10:08.379
It's over.

00:10:14.685 --> 00:10:15.953
Can we talk?

00:10:17.722 --> 00:10:19.690
What do I do? Oh, crap!

00:10:20.291 --> 00:10:22.159
You know who I am, right?

00:10:24.829 --> 00:10:26.564
You're the Blue Ranger.

00:10:26.630 --> 00:10:27.665
I'm Yellow.

00:10:30.434 --> 00:10:31.702
What're you doing here?

00:10:31.769 --> 00:10:33.170
Well, I mean…

00:10:33.971 --> 00:10:36.407
I slipped out of a party with a guy.

00:10:36.474 --> 00:10:37.608
Stop lying.

00:10:37.675 --> 00:10:39.376
I'm not lying.

00:10:39.443 --> 00:10:41.479
You were hugging under the tree.

00:10:41.545 --> 00:10:43.180
Yes, we were.

00:10:43.247 --> 00:10:44.915
You didn't hug him back.

00:10:47.051 --> 00:10:49.220
Your hands were out like a frog.

00:10:49.820 --> 00:10:51.055
Taking pictures?

00:10:51.722 --> 00:10:54.525
Does the guy have the camera?

00:10:55.893 --> 00:10:58.295
What are you talking about?

00:10:58.362 --> 00:10:59.530
How long were you here?

00:11:00.498 --> 00:11:01.899
A while, right?

00:11:03.033 --> 00:11:04.101
Which tabloid?

00:11:04.735 --> 00:11:06.337
-Huh?
-Don't play dumb.

00:11:06.403 --> 00:11:08.272
You make a living on others' misery.

00:11:09.173 --> 00:11:11.242
Is doing that fun for you?

00:11:12.510 --> 00:11:13.811
It's a violation of privacy.

00:11:14.678 --> 00:11:16.814
That's how you make a living.

00:11:17.782 --> 00:11:18.983
You're the worst.

00:11:29.026 --> 00:11:30.294
Was that Yutaka Takagi?

00:11:32.696 --> 00:11:34.365
Crap, we're busted.

00:11:36.367 --> 00:11:38.102
Did you get any info?

00:11:39.136 --> 00:11:40.704
-Huh?
-What?

00:11:52.149 --> 00:11:53.284
Really?

00:11:53.350 --> 00:11:55.553
You made contact with the target!

00:11:56.554 --> 00:11:57.721
What did he say?

00:11:59.390 --> 00:12:01.692
That I hugged poorly.

00:12:02.860 --> 00:12:03.894
Say what?

00:12:03.961 --> 00:12:04.962
What else?

00:12:05.629 --> 00:12:06.730
That's all.

00:12:07.565 --> 00:12:10.301
Where's the recording
of this conversation? Any pictures?

00:12:13.237 --> 00:12:17.208
Anyway, we stuck around until
the afternoon, but they never came out.

00:12:17.775 --> 00:12:18.709
I see.

00:12:19.310 --> 00:12:20.644
The tip's solid?

00:12:21.212 --> 00:12:22.313
Yeah.

00:12:22.379 --> 00:12:25.049
Yutaka and Kirari were on set by morning.

00:12:25.115 --> 00:12:26.150
They slipped out.

00:12:26.984 --> 00:12:29.019
There's no back exit,

00:12:29.086 --> 00:12:32.489
so maybe they got help
from the building's janitor to get out.

00:12:33.057 --> 00:12:34.658
I see.

00:12:35.826 --> 00:12:38.162
I guess I gotta kill it.

00:12:38.229 --> 00:12:39.563
What, really?

00:12:40.130 --> 00:12:43.634
Getting caught going into
the same apartment can be a scandal,

00:12:43.701 --> 00:12:47.872
but I doubt the chief is gonna give
the green light for C-list celebrities.

00:12:47.938 --> 00:12:49.306
I think so too.

00:12:49.373 --> 00:12:50.574
I'm sorry!

00:12:51.175 --> 00:12:54.378
I mean, this was just a tiny scoop.

00:12:55.045 --> 00:12:56.513
No big deal, it happens.

00:12:56.580 --> 00:12:57.481
Yes.

00:12:57.548 --> 00:12:58.782
Moving on.

00:12:58.849 --> 00:13:03.487
Daisuke, you got something
that can fill half a page?

00:13:04.288 --> 00:13:05.289
Let's see.

00:13:05.356 --> 00:13:06.857
I've got a few in stock.

00:13:06.924 --> 00:13:08.158
Great, thanks.

00:13:08.826 --> 00:13:10.094
Anyway, good job.

00:13:13.697 --> 00:13:14.531
Come in.

00:13:15.799 --> 00:13:16.767
Can I have a moment?

00:13:17.534 --> 00:13:18.402
Thank you.

00:13:19.069 --> 00:13:20.037
Ms. Shinoda?

00:13:20.104 --> 00:13:20.938
Yes?

00:13:23.440 --> 00:13:25.042
I have a favor.

00:13:26.076 --> 00:13:28.612
I want you to support Akutsu
on his stakeout.

00:13:29.280 --> 00:13:31.749
Can you go take a nap now
and come back after?

00:13:32.483 --> 00:13:33.584
Okay.

00:13:35.686 --> 00:13:36.654
Thanks.

00:13:48.165 --> 00:13:49.199
I can't sleep.

00:13:50.534 --> 00:13:51.635
I can't sleep!

00:13:53.237 --> 00:13:57.241
If I only recorded that conversation
with Yutaka Takagi.

00:13:58.676 --> 00:14:02.980
If I only took a single picture
on my phone.

00:14:04.281 --> 00:14:08.085
If I only hugged Mr. Suzaki harder then!

00:14:16.493 --> 00:14:17.594
Are you okay?

00:14:19.830 --> 00:14:20.864
Ms. Shinoda?

00:14:30.908 --> 00:14:32.643
An all-night stakeout?

00:14:33.610 --> 00:14:34.611
That sounds tough.

00:14:35.379 --> 00:14:38.148
It's nothing compared to
what you did, Kuwabara.

00:14:38.215 --> 00:14:39.616
I heard from Asuka.

00:14:39.683 --> 00:14:43.287
You got stuck with a brutal story
as soon as you joined.

00:14:45.389 --> 00:14:46.590
You got it wrong.

00:14:50.260 --> 00:14:55.599
I was doing research for it,
but I was really just a lowly grunt.

00:14:57.301 --> 00:15:02.740
It was the kind of job I felt lucky
to get even a sentence published.

00:15:04.675 --> 00:15:08.345
I mean, I was being treated like
everyone's servant,

00:15:08.412 --> 00:15:10.447
doing things anyone could do.

00:15:12.349 --> 00:15:16.420
I just diligently carried out
trivial tasks.

00:15:18.422 --> 00:15:19.823
Something anyone could do?

00:15:21.425 --> 00:15:23.327
Like buying stuff
at the convenience store?

00:15:24.561 --> 00:15:25.396
Yeah.

00:15:25.462 --> 00:15:28.132
Then how did you get burnt out in a year?

00:15:28.198 --> 00:15:31.101
If it wasn't the trivial tasks,
did you get treated that badly?

00:15:32.169 --> 00:15:33.203
That's not it.

00:15:40.044 --> 00:15:43.647
I couldn't push the doorbell anymore.

00:15:45.883 --> 00:15:46.817
Doorbell?

00:15:52.022 --> 00:15:56.560
I pushed the doorbell, mentioned I was
from Sengokusha, and stated my business.

00:15:57.761 --> 00:16:02.733
Most would say they didn't know anything,
or had no idea.

00:16:03.300 --> 00:16:05.269
Get out of my way!

00:16:05.836 --> 00:16:06.703
It was fine.

00:16:07.371 --> 00:16:10.040
It was my job to go ask around.

00:16:10.107 --> 00:16:11.708
It wasn't pointless.

00:16:12.676 --> 00:16:15.179
I was sent to do it
because it was necessary.

00:16:15.245 --> 00:16:16.013
Sorry.

00:16:16.080 --> 00:16:17.481
Leave me alone!

00:16:17.548 --> 00:16:18.449
I knew it.

00:16:21.051 --> 00:16:24.755
I didn't get jaded from being made
to do boring work either.

00:16:25.689 --> 00:16:26.723
I understood.

00:16:28.659 --> 00:16:29.593
But one day…

00:16:37.334 --> 00:16:39.036
I couldn't push the doorbell.

00:16:43.073 --> 00:16:45.843
I thought pushing the doorbell
and being ignored,

00:16:45.909 --> 00:16:49.613
or getting blasted with insults
or sprayed with water was nothing.

00:16:59.156 --> 00:17:01.492
I HATE SENGOKU WEEKLY

00:17:02.426 --> 00:17:03.961
I shouldn't let it get to me.

00:17:04.561 --> 00:17:06.497
I knew it in my head.

00:17:10.167 --> 00:17:13.804
I thought I was
a stronger person than this.

00:17:17.941 --> 00:17:20.043
I learned how weak I was.

00:17:24.882 --> 00:17:27.551
Everyone has their
strengths and weaknesses.

00:17:28.886 --> 00:17:32.322
I left because I couldn't cut it.

00:17:34.191 --> 00:17:39.630
But you might be able to
keep your head down and push through.

00:17:41.465 --> 00:17:44.902
Besides, it's not like failing
means your life is over.

00:17:46.003 --> 00:17:49.339
I mean, I've started over
at a different department.

00:17:51.708 --> 00:17:56.013
Ms. Shinoda, I'm rooting for you!

00:17:57.381 --> 00:17:58.549
Kuwabara.

00:18:01.385 --> 00:18:03.320
I have to go to a meeting now.

00:18:03.387 --> 00:18:05.122
-Sure. Thank you.
-My pleasure.

00:18:09.193 --> 00:18:10.060
Good luck!

00:18:11.595 --> 00:18:12.563
I'll try.

00:18:36.086 --> 00:18:36.987
So sweet!

00:18:43.160 --> 00:18:45.529
SENGOKU WEEKLY EDITING DEPARTMENT

00:18:51.335 --> 00:18:52.569
Good work today.

00:18:52.636 --> 00:18:54.071
Shinoda.

00:18:54.137 --> 00:18:56.139
I heard you're supporting Akutsu.

00:18:56.206 --> 00:18:57.841
Yes, I'm heading there soon.

00:18:57.908 --> 00:18:59.576
Okay. Good luck to you.

00:19:00.844 --> 00:19:03.547
Mr. Murai, what happened with that story?

00:19:04.248 --> 00:19:05.282
Which?

00:19:05.349 --> 00:19:06.383
The teenage girl.

00:19:06.450 --> 00:19:10.587
We tried to meet this girl to talk to her,

00:19:10.654 --> 00:19:12.823
but somehow, she's gone missing.

00:19:12.889 --> 00:19:15.192
Her name is Madoka Hashimoto.

00:19:16.793 --> 00:19:19.363
Haven't received
any good information since.

00:19:19.963 --> 00:19:20.998
I see.

00:19:22.366 --> 00:19:24.234
Hey, Ms. Shinoda, did you get any sleep?

00:19:28.005 --> 00:19:29.506
Let's go to the meeting room.

00:19:30.507 --> 00:19:31.341
Excuse me.

00:19:31.942 --> 00:19:34.945
About Akutsu's stakeout, is it…

00:19:35.779 --> 00:19:36.780
You heard?

00:19:37.447 --> 00:19:38.482
It's a cemetery.

00:19:39.049 --> 00:19:40.284
I'll send the address.

00:19:41.285 --> 00:19:42.319
Cemetery.

00:19:46.523 --> 00:19:48.025
A cemetery at night?

00:19:49.293 --> 00:19:50.894
TO BE CONTINUED

00:19:51.461 --> 00:19:52.429
I'm scared.

00:19:52.496 --> 00:19:54.031
This is way too scary.

00:19:54.097 --> 00:19:58.035
She's an evil woman who tricked a man
to spend embezzled company money.

00:19:59.970 --> 00:20:04.308
There's a chance of getting caught up
in something and pursued by tabloids.

00:20:04.374 --> 00:20:06.877
