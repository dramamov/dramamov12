2025 National Civil Service Exam
Round One Written Examination

00:01:34.527 --> 00:01:40.100
Ministry of Education, Culture,
Sports, Science and Technology

00:01:55.648 --> 00:01:57.250
What exactly is going on here?

00:02:00.353 --> 00:02:01.554
Mr. Mikami.

00:02:02.222 --> 00:02:05.258
There was a stabbing
at the civil service exam venue.

00:02:05.758 --> 00:02:06.893
They stabbed a proctor?

00:02:06.993 --> 00:02:09.262
No, it was an examinee.

00:02:11.764 --> 00:02:12.765
I see.

00:02:21.841 --> 00:02:24.377
You don't seem interested.

00:02:25.311 --> 00:02:27.280
Should I be?

00:02:27.447 --> 00:02:28.748
You sound aloof.

00:02:29.249 --> 00:02:31.017
To think you're about to
work in education.

00:02:31.184 --> 00:02:33.953
Who's aloof now?

00:02:36.656 --> 00:02:41.528
Ministry of Education officials
dream of teaching at schools.

00:02:41.628 --> 00:02:42.829
I'd love to take your place.

00:02:42.896 --> 00:02:44.364
No way, not happening.

00:02:44.464 --> 00:02:46.699
You don't even have
a teaching license, Makino.

00:02:51.171 --> 00:02:52.305
Mr. Makino.

00:02:52.372 --> 00:02:54.474
The advance notice for tomorrow's
parliamentary questions has arrived.

00:02:54.574 --> 00:02:55.808
I'll be right there.

00:03:02.715 --> 00:03:03.950
You know...

00:03:04.517 --> 00:03:06.419
Honestly, I'm envious.

00:03:07.020 --> 00:03:08.021
Why?

00:03:08.154 --> 00:03:09.956
Because this is the first time

00:03:10.056 --> 00:03:12.258
a bureaucrat is dispatched
to a private high school.

00:03:12.592 --> 00:03:14.627
You're incredible, Mr. Mikami.

00:03:15.628 --> 00:03:16.863
It's a demotion.

00:03:19.232 --> 00:03:21.234
A convenient way to exile me.

00:03:25.071 --> 00:03:27.440
I was betrayed by a friend I trusted.

00:03:28.141 --> 00:03:29.142
What?

00:03:44.357 --> 00:03:45.358
Step back!

00:03:45.458 --> 00:03:51.397
Is it fate that
the murder happened today?

00:03:53.933 --> 00:03:56.169
Reforming education...

00:03:56.536 --> 00:04:02.709
Everyone knows it's necessary
to change this rigid society.

00:04:03.910 --> 00:04:06.045
And yet, this place,
the very heart of it all

00:04:06.145 --> 00:04:07.747
is making a spectacle of
the incident.

00:04:07.814 --> 00:04:10.516
They're getting oddly excited
like a crowd of onlookers.

00:04:13.753 --> 00:04:17.323
No one ever thinks
they'd play a part in such an event

00:04:18.224 --> 00:04:21.294
until it actually happens to them.

00:04:24.764 --> 00:04:25.898
Right now

00:04:26.666 --> 00:04:30.036
you alone bear the weight of
this society's distortions.

00:04:32.872 --> 00:04:34.507
You stand there, completely alone.

00:04:48.721 --> 00:04:51.124
I will not forsake that loneliness.

00:04:52.859 --> 00:04:54.727
National Civil Service Examinee
Stabbed to Death

00:04:57.797 --> 00:05:00.433
You, too, are searching
for a place to return to.

00:05:06.472 --> 00:05:10.276
The potential
sleeping within all of you guides me.

00:05:10.810 --> 00:05:13.946
Examinee Stabbing
Suspect Mayama Arrested in the Act

00:05:22.322 --> 00:05:25.024
If it means
wading through the mud, I'm ready.

00:05:39.906 --> 00:05:44.377
The arrested suspect is the examinee
Yuzuru Mayama, age 22.

00:05:44.477 --> 00:05:45.645
According to the police

00:05:45.712 --> 00:05:48.614
at 4:30 p.m., Suspect Mayama stabbed
fellow examinee Shibutani

00:05:48.715 --> 00:05:52.385
who had just finished his exam
and was about to leave the venue...

00:05:53.686 --> 00:05:57.323
I will not ignore
the voiceless screams within you.

00:06:03.796 --> 00:06:09.202
You taught me that love and hatred
exist so very close to each other.

00:06:36.329 --> 00:06:37.663
I'm going.

00:06:43.469 --> 00:06:49.075
MR. MIKAMI'S CLASSROOM

00:07:08.528 --> 00:07:10.563
Starting this term, I've been
assigned to this school.

00:07:10.663 --> 00:07:12.398
My name is Mikami Takashi.

00:07:12.899 --> 00:07:16.436
I will be your homeroom teacher
this year. Nice to meet you all.

00:07:16.536 --> 00:07:17.870
What?

00:07:17.970 --> 00:07:19.772
Homeroom teacher?
What's going on?

00:07:22.875 --> 00:07:24.544
– I...
– Excuse me.

00:07:25.578 --> 00:07:27.914
What is it, Sakurai?

00:07:28.014 --> 00:07:31.217
– He remembers her name?
– Wow. That's freaky.

00:07:31.317 --> 00:07:32.852
Does he already know all of us?

00:07:32.952 --> 00:07:35.955
Why isn't Ms. Koreeda
our homeroom teacher?

00:07:36.055 --> 00:07:39.358
Ms. Koreeda will be assisting
as the co-homeroom teacher.

00:07:39.859 --> 00:07:41.527
Isn't that strange?

00:07:43.362 --> 00:07:45.531
Shouldn't our homeroom teacher
be the same as last year?

00:07:45.631 --> 00:07:46.899
That's what I heard.

00:07:46.999 --> 00:07:48.501
I'd like to know the reason.

00:07:48.601 --> 00:07:50.336
I wasn't given an explanation.

00:07:50.703 --> 00:07:54.674
So they didn't even
tell you, Ms. Koreeda?

00:07:56.709 --> 00:07:59.779
I asked, but they wouldn't tell me.

00:08:00.079 --> 00:08:01.848
That's bad.

00:08:07.153 --> 00:08:10.523
This is our senior year.
It's a very important year.

00:08:12.091 --> 00:08:14.093
Something this irregular
is unsettling.

00:08:14.627 --> 00:08:17.196
I was dispatched here
from the Ministry of Education.

00:08:17.563 --> 00:08:20.399
– What?
– The Ministry of Education?

00:08:21.033 --> 00:08:22.068
Ministry of Education?

00:08:22.635 --> 00:08:24.403
Why is a bureaucrat here?

00:08:24.504 --> 00:08:26.806
The Ministry of Education
believes that bureaucrats

00:08:26.906 --> 00:08:28.541
should experience
the education field firsthand.

00:08:28.641 --> 00:08:31.344
As such, young bureaucrats
may be dispatched as teachers.

00:08:31.444 --> 00:08:35.381
And this year, the program has been
expanded to private high schools

00:08:35.481 --> 00:08:37.149
which is why I was assigned here.

00:08:37.250 --> 00:08:40.653
But as a homeroom teacher?
That's ridiculous.

00:08:40.786 --> 00:08:44.190
It's basic protocol to
give a bureaucrat a fitting role.

00:08:44.357 --> 00:08:47.960
A student from this school
should at least know that.

00:08:48.094 --> 00:08:49.795
The fact that I'm satisfied
being a homeroom teacher

00:08:49.896 --> 00:08:51.264
shows how humble I am.

00:08:59.305 --> 00:09:01.073
Can you even teach?

00:09:03.342 --> 00:09:05.444
You're Kanzaki
from the journalism club.

00:09:06.812 --> 00:09:07.813
What?

00:09:09.382 --> 00:09:11.350
"This class has Kanzaki in it."

00:09:11.784 --> 00:09:15.187
I was told to be wary of you
and not get taken for a fool.

00:09:15.288 --> 00:09:16.455
Please stop.

00:09:16.556 --> 00:09:17.623
It's fine.

00:09:17.690 --> 00:09:19.258
I don't fall for simple provocations.

00:09:19.392 --> 00:09:21.060
You're the one doing the provoking.

00:09:21.360 --> 00:09:24.630
That's true,
since I'm someone to be wary of.

00:09:28.601 --> 00:09:31.504
Then, I might as well take the bait.

00:09:31.604 --> 00:09:32.605
What?

00:09:32.672 --> 00:09:34.340
Based on the accuracy rate
of last year's final exams

00:09:34.473 --> 00:09:36.943
it's clear that question four
was the weakest.

00:09:37.610 --> 00:09:39.545
Do you remember question four?

00:09:46.485 --> 00:09:49.322
The question asks to find
the minimum value

00:09:49.422 --> 00:09:53.225
so most people try to solve it
using trigonometric functions.

00:09:54.460 --> 00:09:57.730
But this is actually
a geometry problem.

00:09:57.830 --> 00:10:00.933
If you draw it out, the answer
immediately becomes obvious.

00:10:07.940 --> 00:10:10.743
With this method, a certain
geometric figure emerges.

00:10:11.210 --> 00:10:15.247
Meaning the minimum value is reached
when Point P coincides with Point A.

00:10:15.348 --> 00:10:19.719
Once you understand that,
the solution becomes simple.

00:10:21.887 --> 00:10:24.890
What's important here is
algebra and geometry.

00:10:25.391 --> 00:10:27.526
This means math consists of
two intertwined fields

00:10:27.627 --> 00:10:28.628
functions and geometry.

00:10:28.728 --> 00:10:31.330
People have this strange belief
that they are separate

00:10:31.764 --> 00:10:33.966
but clinging to that idea will
make you miss solvable problems.

00:10:34.066 --> 00:10:35.668
The reason
they are studied alternately

00:10:35.735 --> 00:10:37.837
is because they are deeply connected.

00:10:38.204 --> 00:10:39.739
Don't forget this perspective.

00:10:53.419 --> 00:10:55.688
When people my age
were in high school

00:10:55.788 --> 00:10:58.691
each grade level had
about 1.1 million students.

00:10:59.191 --> 00:11:01.460
Meanwhile,
the number of people who passed

00:11:01.560 --> 00:11:02.895
the national civil service exam
was 1,370.

00:11:02.995 --> 00:11:05.097
That means
about one in a thousand made it.

00:11:06.365 --> 00:11:09.602
And that one person is me.

00:11:10.536 --> 00:11:13.205
I have never failed an exam.

00:11:13.706 --> 00:11:16.142
Every test I took,
I passed at the top.

00:11:16.242 --> 00:11:17.243
Do you know why?

00:11:18.744 --> 00:11:20.913
Because I knew how to study.

00:11:21.981 --> 00:11:24.817
When it comes to
entrance exam strategies

00:11:24.917 --> 00:11:27.186
there's no teacher
in this school who can beat me.

00:11:31.123 --> 00:11:35.161
Do you all
think of yourselves as elites?

00:11:38.397 --> 00:11:40.466
Rintoku Academy has
the highest number of students

00:11:40.566 --> 00:11:42.935
admitted to the Tokyo University
in the prefecture.

00:11:43.369 --> 00:11:47.173
Since most of you aim to
go to Tokyo University

00:11:47.406 --> 00:11:50.443
it's natural that
you consider yourselves as elites.

00:11:51.610 --> 00:11:54.680
But do you truly understand
what it means to be an elite?

00:11:56.082 --> 00:11:58.451
The word "elite" derives from Latin

00:11:58.551 --> 00:12:00.920
and originally means "chosen by God."

00:12:01.587 --> 00:12:04.290
In this country, people believe that
a high academic background

00:12:04.390 --> 00:12:07.293
a prestigious social status,
and a high income

00:12:07.393 --> 00:12:08.928
makes someone an elite.

00:12:11.263 --> 00:12:13.365
But that's not
what being an elite is.

00:12:21.173 --> 00:12:23.542
That's just being
a future upper-class citizen.

00:12:37.223 --> 00:12:42.161
Well then, I look forward to
working with you all this year.

00:12:48.768 --> 00:12:50.269
Mr. Mikami, a moment, please.

00:12:51.170 --> 00:12:52.605
What do you think you're doing?

00:12:52.705 --> 00:12:53.706
What do you mean?

00:12:53.806 --> 00:12:56.609
You were blatantly
provoking the students.

00:12:56.709 --> 00:12:59.011
– Is that a problem?
– Of course it is!

00:12:59.111 --> 00:13:01.781
Then, Ms. Koreeda, what do you expect
from the students?

00:13:01.881 --> 00:13:02.882
What?

00:13:02.982 --> 00:13:04.917
Do you want them to be
fearless warriors

00:13:05.017 --> 00:13:06.919
who conquer
the battlefield of entrance exams?

00:13:07.119 --> 00:13:08.654
That's not what I meant.

00:13:09.121 --> 00:13:10.890
However, entrance exams
waits for no one.

00:13:10.990 --> 00:13:13.993
If schools like Rintoku
don't cultivate true elites

00:13:14.093 --> 00:13:15.561
this country will collapse.

00:13:21.500 --> 00:13:22.935
No matter the reason

00:13:23.035 --> 00:13:25.604
calling students
"future upper-class citizens"

00:13:25.704 --> 00:13:27.573
to look down on them is unacceptable.

00:13:28.607 --> 00:13:30.075
What's so funny?

00:13:31.310 --> 00:13:32.745
Slow loris.

00:13:33.112 --> 00:13:34.113
What?

00:13:34.647 --> 00:13:36.282
They look cute

00:13:36.348 --> 00:13:39.351
but they're the only primates
that carry venom.

00:13:40.085 --> 00:13:42.922
Even with their tiny bodies,
which weigh just a few pounds

00:13:43.022 --> 00:13:45.958
they coat their fur with toxic saliva
and fight off predators.

00:13:46.492 --> 00:13:47.860
You remind me of them.

00:13:48.694 --> 00:13:51.063
– Are you mocking me?
– No, not at all.

00:13:51.163 --> 00:13:52.164
But...

00:13:52.264 --> 00:13:55.067
You were suddenly replaced
as the homeroom teacher.

00:13:55.901 --> 00:13:57.303
You should fight back.

00:13:59.271 --> 00:14:00.639
Mr. Mikami!

00:14:01.540 --> 00:14:03.676
Chairman Kodai!

00:14:05.778 --> 00:14:08.848
I'll consider it,
so let's talk again later.

00:14:08.948 --> 00:14:11.183
– Promise?
– Sure, I got it.

00:14:11.283 --> 00:14:14.420
– Please, Chairman!
– Chairman, please!

00:14:16.422 --> 00:14:19.491
They want to start
a Classic Poetry club.

00:14:19.592 --> 00:14:22.461
How nice. It's good to
learn about traditional culture.

00:14:22.561 --> 00:14:25.064
And they come directly
to the chairman himself?

00:14:25.931 --> 00:14:31.237
I want Rintoku to be a school
with open communication.

00:14:31.871 --> 00:14:34.907
I try to speak with the students
as much as possible.

00:14:35.474 --> 00:14:38.410
Because of that,
they come to me for everything.

00:14:38.510 --> 00:14:40.846
But getting students to
reveal their true thoughts

00:14:40.980 --> 00:14:42.281
isn't easy nowadays, is it?

00:14:42.381 --> 00:14:43.415
That's right.

00:14:43.482 --> 00:14:46.886
So, to make myself approachable

00:14:47.186 --> 00:14:49.688
I casually
wander around the school like this.

00:14:50.289 --> 00:14:51.724
Chairman Kodai!

00:14:54.493 --> 00:14:55.494
See?

00:14:56.262 --> 00:14:59.899
If there's anything,
don't hesitate to let me know.

00:14:59.999 --> 00:15:01.567
– Thank you.
– Well then.

00:15:01.667 --> 00:15:02.668
See you.

00:15:05.504 --> 00:15:07.806
– What's going on?
– Hello.

00:15:08.307 --> 00:15:11.210
We want to establish an e-sports club
under the student council.

00:15:11.310 --> 00:15:12.978
E-sports?

00:15:14.647 --> 00:15:16.248
There's something I want to ask.

00:15:17.816 --> 00:15:19.518
It's about Kanzaki Takuto.

00:15:20.419 --> 00:15:22.354
Is it true that he exposed
a teacher's affair

00:15:22.421 --> 00:15:26.258
published it in the school newspaper,
and forced them to resign?

00:15:26.358 --> 00:15:28.427
You mean the Rintoku Newspaper?

00:15:29.028 --> 00:15:30.129
It's true.

00:15:30.362 --> 00:15:31.630
You knew about it, didn't you?

00:15:31.730 --> 00:15:33.465
The teacher who resigned...

00:15:33.532 --> 00:15:35.701
Ms. Saejima, I believe?

00:15:35.935 --> 00:15:37.269
She's the one, right?

00:15:37.803 --> 00:15:41.774
– Wait, you know about it?
– Yes.

00:16:13.372 --> 00:16:15.207
Things are getting interesting,
isn't it?

00:16:16.542 --> 00:16:17.943
What part of this is interesting?

00:16:18.410 --> 00:16:20.412
Seeing you make that face.

00:16:24.283 --> 00:16:26.719
– What do you think?
– About what?

00:16:28.287 --> 00:16:29.321
Isn't this bad?

00:16:30.089 --> 00:16:32.291
His lesson was great

00:16:32.391 --> 00:16:34.693
but I don't like being
forced into submission like that.

00:16:34.793 --> 00:16:38.263
"Future upper-class citizens"
was a bit too much.

00:16:38.364 --> 00:16:39.365
Seriously.

00:16:39.465 --> 00:16:41.266
Well, he's the definition
of a bureaucrat.

00:16:41.467 --> 00:16:43.068
He's so irritating.

00:16:43.168 --> 00:16:44.870
I actually think he's fine.

00:16:44.970 --> 00:16:46.638
What? How?

00:16:46.739 --> 00:16:49.675
He didn't say anything
that was incorrect.

00:16:50.075 --> 00:16:51.076
Yeah, but still.

00:16:51.176 --> 00:16:52.378
Let's drop it.

00:16:53.712 --> 00:16:54.747
Why?

00:16:54.847 --> 00:16:57.783
If we start getting flustered,
we're playing right into his hands.

00:17:00.619 --> 00:17:03.822
Chigira, ask your dad to step in.

00:17:04.023 --> 00:17:05.024
What do you mean?

00:17:05.124 --> 00:17:06.258
That's right!

00:17:06.325 --> 00:17:08.861
The only way to beat a bureaucrat
is with a politician.

00:17:08.961 --> 00:17:11.230
– Exactly.
– Shut up already.

00:17:11.530 --> 00:17:13.332
Hey, what do you think, Fuyuki?

00:17:13.665 --> 00:17:16.602
– Yeah, I'm curious, too.
– Just ignore the guy.

00:17:17.770 --> 00:17:19.972
Just focus on submitting
your assignments properly.

00:17:22.074 --> 00:17:23.776
So, everything okay?

00:17:23.942 --> 00:17:26.278
Mr. Mizohata.
How can I help you?

00:17:26.378 --> 00:17:29.081
I'm talking about Ms. Koreeda.

00:17:29.281 --> 00:17:31.316
What about her?

00:17:32.317 --> 00:17:33.852
She's passionate.

00:17:34.119 --> 00:17:37.489
But sometimes, just sometimes...

00:17:37.790 --> 00:17:39.658
She goes too far.

00:17:40.092 --> 00:17:41.660
In what way?

00:17:42.728 --> 00:17:43.729
Excuse me.

00:17:48.100 --> 00:17:50.769
Well, she insists on
making the exams by herself.

00:17:50.869 --> 00:17:54.540
Right now, it's standard for
all subject teachers to

00:17:54.640 --> 00:17:56.975
collaborate on creating tests.

00:17:57.076 --> 00:17:58.110
Is Rintoku the same?

00:17:58.210 --> 00:18:02.014
Yes. A little personal touch
is fine, but...

00:18:02.147 --> 00:18:05.050
Creating an entirely original exam
is a problem?

00:18:05.951 --> 00:18:10.422
She's stubborn about it and
won't change, which is frustrating.

00:18:11.156 --> 00:18:13.959
Don't tell anyone, but she comes from
a distinguished family.

00:18:14.693 --> 00:18:20.632
Her parents donated a significant sum
when Chairman Kodai founded Rintoku.

00:18:21.266 --> 00:18:23.502
Even now, they continue to
support the school.

00:18:23.802 --> 00:18:27.172
That's how she got hired here.

00:18:27.439 --> 00:18:29.308
Basically, she's a nepotism hire.

00:18:29.975 --> 00:18:32.478
So we can't
push back on her too hard.

00:18:32.578 --> 00:18:34.279
Honestly, I'm at a loss.

00:18:35.781 --> 00:18:40.219
I was actually relieved when you
took over as homeroom teacher.

00:18:41.720 --> 00:18:43.322
It was a good exam, though.

00:18:43.422 --> 00:18:44.423
What?

00:18:45.057 --> 00:18:47.659
I tried solving last year's
final exam questions.

00:18:48.393 --> 00:18:51.296
– The one she made?
– Yes.

00:18:51.997 --> 00:18:54.933
University entrance exams these days
test a student's ability

00:18:55.067 --> 00:18:58.036
to think, reason,
and express themselves.

00:18:58.403 --> 00:19:01.607
Even the math questions
are needlessly long.

00:19:02.040 --> 00:19:04.209
Some are formatted like
short stories for no reason.

00:19:05.377 --> 00:19:08.447
Her long comprehension problems
are based on that trend.

00:19:08.547 --> 00:19:12.351
I think they're excellent for
testing fundamental understanding.

00:19:12.885 --> 00:19:15.020
What do you think, Mr. Mizohata?

00:19:17.222 --> 00:19:18.891
Well, if you put it that way...

00:19:20.459 --> 00:19:22.027
Wait, you haven't taken it yet?

00:19:24.363 --> 00:19:26.765
I haven't. I didn't need to.

00:19:27.566 --> 00:19:29.434
This part in particular.

00:19:29.801 --> 00:19:31.103
"Summarize from
the reverse perspective."

00:19:31.303 --> 00:19:33.105
Wow, things are getting tense
from day one.

00:19:33.205 --> 00:19:34.973
Stop, they can hear us!

00:19:35.073 --> 00:19:36.141
Did you know?

00:19:36.241 --> 00:19:38.677
Mr. Mizohata
failed the civil service exam

00:19:38.744 --> 00:19:40.212
and wound up being a teacher.

00:19:40.312 --> 00:19:41.713
Really?

00:19:41.813 --> 00:19:44.483
Male jealousy sure is terrifying,
isn't it?

00:19:44.783 --> 00:19:48.554
Her questions really do test
deep comprehension skills.

00:19:52.858 --> 00:19:54.893
You are truly impressive.

00:19:55.027 --> 00:19:56.361
You think on a different level.

00:19:56.428 --> 00:19:57.429
Not at all.

00:19:57.496 --> 00:20:00.699
Bureaucrats have to
be able to recall data instantly.

00:20:00.799 --> 00:20:03.268
If not, they're called incompetent.
It's a sad job.

00:20:03.569 --> 00:20:05.437
It's just a habit ingrained in me.

00:20:06.338 --> 00:20:10.075
Keep stimulating
the students like this.

00:20:13.378 --> 00:20:14.713
It's time for your first class.

00:20:15.948 --> 00:20:17.783
Don't make me more nervous.

00:20:19.551 --> 00:20:21.887
Alright, here I go.

00:20:29.294 --> 00:20:31.964
NURSE'S OFFICE
PLEASE KNOCK BEFORE ENTERING

00:20:32.464 --> 00:20:34.032
There's no need to push yourself

00:20:34.132 --> 00:20:36.535
just because it's the first day
of a new semester, Shiiba.

00:20:37.169 --> 00:20:39.471
If it's too much, just leave early.

00:20:40.839 --> 00:20:43.475
I'll be fine after a short rest.

00:20:43.575 --> 00:20:46.878
You're such a hard worker.

00:21:02.894 --> 00:21:05.130
– See you tomorrow.
– Thank you.

00:21:05.230 --> 00:21:06.231
Good work.

00:21:07.699 --> 00:21:09.101
Ms. Koreeda.

00:21:09.434 --> 00:21:11.837
Can't you come back
as our homeroom teacher?

00:21:12.004 --> 00:21:14.706
I'm happy you feel that way,
but it's probably impossible.

00:21:14.806 --> 00:21:18.477
That bureaucrat teacher
feels like an AI.

00:21:18.577 --> 00:21:20.512
– He is creepy, isn't he?
– Yeah.

00:21:21.046 --> 00:21:24.950
This is what
an AI teacher is like, right?

00:21:25.050 --> 00:21:26.852
– What?
– What?

00:21:33.425 --> 00:21:34.926
He's kind of cute when he smiles.

00:21:35.027 --> 00:21:36.628
Isn't this a bit creepy?

00:21:36.762 --> 00:21:38.830
I hereby name him "Okami."

00:21:38.930 --> 00:21:40.766
– What?
– What? Okami?

00:21:40.866 --> 00:21:44.469
I mean, isn't it actually
harder to read his name as Mikami?

00:21:45.003 --> 00:21:47.873
O-ka-mi.

00:21:49.741 --> 00:21:51.009
You're right!

00:21:51.109 --> 00:21:54.613
An elite bureaucrat
with that name feels like a joke.

00:21:54.713 --> 00:21:56.481
I thought the same thing.

00:21:56.548 --> 00:21:57.649
Nice one, Jigen!

00:21:58.617 --> 00:21:59.618
Right?

00:22:00.352 --> 00:22:03.989
Apparently, he already has data
on everyone in the class.

00:22:04.089 --> 00:22:05.557
– What?
– Data?

00:22:05.657 --> 00:22:08.093
Grades, desired universities,
family backgrounds...

00:22:08.193 --> 00:22:10.095
That's scary.

00:22:10.195 --> 00:22:12.998
Well, he is a bureaucrat.
So, he'd do something like that.

00:22:13.098 --> 00:22:14.666
But still, isn't that unsettling?

00:22:16.802 --> 00:22:20.539
That's unusual.
Kanzaki seems really annoyed.

00:22:20.972 --> 00:22:22.240
Isn't that good, though?

00:22:22.341 --> 00:22:25.243
Even the undefeated king
needs a rival.

00:22:27.446 --> 00:22:29.881
Even with AI's advancement,
teaching is still considered

00:22:29.948 --> 00:22:32.551
one of the seven jobs
that won't disappear.

00:22:32.651 --> 00:22:37.656
But in Okami's case,
he's the human turning into an AI.

00:22:42.928 --> 00:22:43.929
Sorry.

00:23:13.258 --> 00:23:14.259
What the hell?

00:23:16.495 --> 00:23:17.496
What?

00:23:18.864 --> 00:23:20.565
– Hello.
– Hello.

00:23:26.004 --> 00:23:28.039
It's about Mr. Mikami.

00:23:28.306 --> 00:23:29.341
What about him?

00:23:29.541 --> 00:23:32.043
He seems different
from what I was told.

00:23:32.377 --> 00:23:33.645
What do you mean?

00:23:33.745 --> 00:23:35.814
Like he's hiding something

00:23:35.914 --> 00:23:37.883
and there's
a troublesome aura about him.

00:23:37.983 --> 00:23:40.085
He seemed like a bright and
cheerful young man.

00:23:40.185 --> 00:23:41.686
Really?

00:23:41.753 --> 00:23:44.489
He was completely different
when I met him.

00:23:44.589 --> 00:23:47.926
Maybe it's just because
you're in battle mode, Mr. Mizobata?

00:23:48.026 --> 00:23:49.027
What?

00:23:50.495 --> 00:23:51.997
It's "Mizohata."

00:23:52.230 --> 00:23:54.533
Rintoku accepted
a bureaucrat dispatch

00:23:54.599 --> 00:24:00.105
so we could receive favors
from the Ministry of Education.

00:24:01.440 --> 00:24:04.543
If this backfires,
that would be a problem.

00:24:04.643 --> 00:24:07.312
That's true.
You are exactly right, sir.

00:24:07.412 --> 00:24:09.314
Then do something,
Principal Katagiri.

00:24:09.414 --> 00:24:12.184
Well, when a bureaucrat comes in

00:24:12.284 --> 00:24:15.487
you have to give them
at least a vice-principal role.

00:24:15.854 --> 00:24:18.390
But, Mr. Mikami humbly said

00:24:18.490 --> 00:24:21.693
he wanted to
face the students as a teacher.

00:24:22.461 --> 00:24:24.729
At the very least,
making him a homeroom teacher

00:24:24.930 --> 00:24:26.798
was necessary to
save face with the Ministry.

00:24:26.865 --> 00:24:28.200
I understand that, but...

00:24:28.300 --> 00:24:30.035
If you want people to accept you

00:24:30.135 --> 00:24:33.805
you need to
make an effort first, Mr. Mizobata.

00:24:35.674 --> 00:24:37.442
It's "Mizohata."

00:24:38.677 --> 00:24:39.678
What?

00:24:40.612 --> 00:24:44.549
Kanzaki, are you planning to
put Okami in his place?

00:24:44.950 --> 00:24:46.551
Don't you think it's odd, Tominaga?

00:24:46.651 --> 00:24:47.652
What is?

00:24:47.819 --> 00:24:49.821
The fact that
our homeroom teacher was changed.

00:24:51.957 --> 00:24:53.792
It's like those detective dramas.

00:24:53.925 --> 00:24:55.660
The veteran detectives
get bossed around

00:24:55.727 --> 00:24:58.330
by some young elite recruit.

00:24:59.130 --> 00:25:01.032
You know, adult politics.

00:25:01.833 --> 00:25:03.368
And you're okay with that?

00:25:04.369 --> 00:25:06.771
Not really, but...

00:25:06.872 --> 00:25:08.139
Not really, but?

00:25:08.740 --> 00:25:13.545
I don't know.
Okami seems kind of interesting.

00:25:14.646 --> 00:25:15.647
What?

00:25:16.715 --> 00:25:17.916
Based on what?

00:25:19.718 --> 00:25:21.286
Just a hunch.

00:25:24.222 --> 00:25:25.490
That makes no sense.

00:25:40.505 --> 00:25:43.275
You were suddenly replaced
as the homeroom teacher.

00:25:43.942 --> 00:25:45.210
You should fight back.

00:26:49.474 --> 00:26:52.243
There's this phrase,
"The personal is political."

00:26:52.444 --> 00:26:55.080
Personal? What's that?

00:26:55.780 --> 00:26:58.850
It means personal struggles
are political issues.

00:26:59.551 --> 00:27:00.552
What does that mean?

00:27:01.720 --> 00:27:03.154
There's a phrase like that.

00:27:05.023 --> 00:27:06.091
What does that mean?

00:27:07.926 --> 00:27:11.563
People's difficulties are often
treated as personal problems.

00:27:11.663 --> 00:27:13.732
But in reality,
they're societal issues.

00:27:13.832 --> 00:27:18.036
In other words, they're problems
that politics should be solving.

00:27:19.471 --> 00:27:21.006
Does that explanation
make sense?

00:27:22.273 --> 00:27:23.675
Well...

00:27:24.376 --> 00:27:26.111
I get the meaning, but...

00:27:26.211 --> 00:27:27.312
Yeah.

00:27:27.912 --> 00:27:30.315
This is probably
still too difficult for you, Takashi.

00:27:30.548 --> 00:27:35.120
But, it's a phrase I value a lot.

00:27:37.355 --> 00:27:40.258
Someday, you'll understand
what it means.

00:27:43.028 --> 00:27:44.029
Yeah.

00:28:11.856 --> 00:28:12.924
Makino.

00:28:12.991 --> 00:28:16.194
From now on, there are a lot of
things I'd like to ask of you.

00:28:16.294 --> 00:28:19.698
"A lot"? That sounds a bit scary.

00:28:20.965 --> 00:28:22.300
What are you saying?

00:28:22.367 --> 00:28:24.269
You were expecting this, weren't you?

00:28:24.536 --> 00:28:26.971
Of course. I'll do
anything you need me to.

00:28:27.072 --> 00:28:31.376
Good. So, have you been
in touch with Mikami?

00:28:31.676 --> 00:28:34.012
No, I haven't.

00:28:34.112 --> 00:28:35.647
Is that so?

00:28:35.747 --> 00:28:36.748
Yes.

00:28:36.815 --> 00:28:39.984
Apparently, he told Tsubuki
I betrayed him

00:28:40.085 --> 00:28:43.154
and sold him out to you
to get him demoted.

00:28:43.722 --> 00:28:46.391
Well, I never intended for it
to be a demotion.

00:28:46.725 --> 00:28:51.563
That said, when you suggested
Mikami as the first bureaucrat

00:28:52.030 --> 00:28:53.898
to be dispatched to a private school

00:28:54.232 --> 00:28:57.335
I almost whistled at
how great an idea it was.

00:28:59.070 --> 00:29:01.973
It's quite convenient for
cooling down the suspicion

00:29:02.073 --> 00:29:03.808
over the revolving door
brokering scandal.

00:29:03.908 --> 00:29:05.210
Exactly.

00:29:05.276 --> 00:29:07.479
That's why I need you two to make up.

00:29:07.912 --> 00:29:10.482
If my subordinates are at odds

00:29:10.615 --> 00:29:13.284
it reflects poorly
on my management skills.

00:29:14.452 --> 00:29:15.587
What's this?

00:29:16.354 --> 00:29:18.723
Are you actually concerned
about how Mikami feels?

00:29:20.391 --> 00:29:21.392
What do you mean?

00:29:21.659 --> 00:29:25.697
Mr. Tsukada, I thought you chose me.

00:29:26.798 --> 00:29:28.099
What are you saying?

00:29:28.166 --> 00:29:30.735
You're both my valuable subordinates.

00:29:31.169 --> 00:29:34.038
I never even thought about
choosing one over the other.

00:29:35.406 --> 00:29:36.674
Thank you very much.

00:29:36.741 --> 00:29:37.742
Excuse me.

00:29:49.754 --> 00:29:51.222
Dinosaurs

00:30:22.420 --> 00:30:24.856
As an explanation for
"The Era Without Gods"...

00:30:24.923 --> 00:30:26.558
Due to scientific development

00:30:26.658 --> 00:30:29.327
people became unable to fully believe
in the existence of gods.

00:30:29.561 --> 00:30:32.263
They lost their religious
moral consciousness.

00:30:32.497 --> 00:30:36.868
Adding such statements
makes the answer more complete.

00:30:49.814 --> 00:30:51.216
With the exams approaching

00:30:51.282 --> 00:30:54.819
it's easy to
rely on convenient techniques.

00:30:55.553 --> 00:30:59.057
But that's exactly why you should be
engaging with good texts.

00:31:00.058 --> 00:31:02.493
Simply picking out words
like "however" and "by the way"

00:31:02.594 --> 00:31:04.195
is just a technique.

00:31:04.662 --> 00:31:07.966
True reading comprehension
comes from understanding

00:31:08.066 --> 00:31:10.168
the fundamental meaning of words.

00:31:12.003 --> 00:31:14.105
Now we'll move on to
an essay question

00:31:14.205 --> 00:31:16.574
from the 2003 Tokyo University
entrance exam.

00:31:17.442 --> 00:31:20.144
The passage you just read
is closely related to this topic.

00:31:20.545 --> 00:31:21.980
Why did Okami come in?

00:31:22.213 --> 00:31:24.415
Apparently, he's been going around
observing classes.

00:31:24.849 --> 00:31:27.352
Yeah, I saw that mentioned
in my club's group chat.

00:31:27.452 --> 00:31:30.622
He just randomly shows up,
regardless of grade level or class.

00:31:31.256 --> 00:31:32.357
How unsettling.

00:31:32.457 --> 00:31:34.492
Could he be a spy
from the Ministry of Education?

00:31:34.559 --> 00:31:36.394
Honestly, that's a real possibility.

00:31:36.995 --> 00:31:40.698
Rintoku probably
accepted him to get grants

00:31:40.798 --> 00:31:43.034
and other benefits
from the government.

00:31:43.534 --> 00:31:45.103
But it seems like it's backfiring.

00:31:45.203 --> 00:31:46.371
Is that what happened?

00:31:46.938 --> 00:31:48.172
Hey, Kanzaki.

00:31:48.239 --> 00:31:49.340
What do you think?

00:31:51.409 --> 00:31:53.044
Don't know, don't care.

00:31:53.144 --> 00:31:54.846
Kanzaki, are you leaving already?

00:31:54.979 --> 00:31:55.980
What about school prep course?

00:31:56.080 --> 00:31:58.016
I get enough from regular classes.
Tokyo University is no big deal.

00:31:58.116 --> 00:31:59.250
Oh, excuse me!

00:31:59.317 --> 00:32:01.152
Unlike you, some of us attend
both school prep and cram school

00:32:01.219 --> 00:32:03.154
and are still
not making the rankings.

00:32:03.254 --> 00:32:05.056
That's not my fault, is it?

00:32:05.290 --> 00:32:06.424
What?

00:32:06.691 --> 00:32:07.992
Wow.

00:32:08.793 --> 00:32:09.894
He said it.

00:32:10.595 --> 00:32:13.097
You caught him at a bad time.

00:32:16.367 --> 00:32:18.136
Mr. Mikami, can we talk for a moment?

00:33:03.715 --> 00:33:05.016
Mr. Mikami.

00:33:05.850 --> 00:33:08.186
If you're going to show up,
at least give me a heads-up.

00:33:08.252 --> 00:33:09.387
Was it a problem?

00:33:09.520 --> 00:33:11.756
Did Mr. Mizohata tell you
to keep an eye on me?

00:33:11.856 --> 00:33:13.858
No, I just wanted to observe.

00:33:14.025 --> 00:33:16.627
– That's quite sarcastic.
– Sarcastic? Why?

00:33:16.928 --> 00:33:18.062
Because...

00:33:18.463 --> 00:33:20.898
Is this how things work now?

00:33:21.065 --> 00:33:22.066
What do you mean?

00:33:22.800 --> 00:33:25.370
Students grading their teachers.

00:33:26.337 --> 00:33:28.639
It even affects
our performance reviews.

00:33:28.873 --> 00:33:31.909
Teachers get salaries,
so it makes sense.

00:33:32.677 --> 00:33:36.014
You are rated
overwhelmingly high, Ms. Koreeda.

00:33:36.347 --> 00:33:39.717
Yes, because I work incredibly hard.

00:33:44.455 --> 00:33:47.425
– Hey, it's a honey badger.
– You know what this is?

00:33:47.525 --> 00:33:50.395
It's said to be
the world's most fearless animal.

00:33:50.561 --> 00:33:52.964
So aggressive that
it even steals food from lions.

00:33:54.298 --> 00:33:56.300
Are you saying that
I'm a honey badger

00:33:56.534 --> 00:33:59.037
and the food I stole was
the homeroom teacher's position?

00:33:59.137 --> 00:34:01.072
Yes, that's right.

00:34:01.906 --> 00:34:04.308
Is this how you're choosing
to fight back?

00:34:06.177 --> 00:34:07.178
What?

00:34:07.412 --> 00:34:10.782
– I'm not your enemy.
– I know that.

00:34:10.915 --> 00:34:13.251
Then maybe you should
learn from the slow loris.

00:34:14.652 --> 00:34:16.320
I don't understand what you mean.

00:34:17.855 --> 00:34:22.493
Even a weak creature can win
if it knows how to fight.

00:34:28.633 --> 00:34:29.934
Ms. Isshiki?

00:34:34.372 --> 00:34:35.540
Could this be...

00:34:35.640 --> 00:34:38.042
Yes, this is Mr. Mikami.

00:34:38.142 --> 00:34:40.511
He's dispatched here as a bureaucrat
from the Ministry of Education.

00:34:41.646 --> 00:34:44.549
– I'm Isshiki, the school nurse.
– Nice to meet you.

00:34:44.649 --> 00:34:47.018
Seniors tend to be
emotionally unstable.

00:34:47.118 --> 00:34:48.753
Let's work closely together.

00:34:49.020 --> 00:34:50.855
Yes, looking forward to it.

00:34:51.422 --> 00:34:52.423
Please excuse me.

00:35:04.202 --> 00:35:05.903
Shall we have some tea?

00:35:06.904 --> 00:35:07.972
Yes, please.

00:35:12.376 --> 00:35:13.611
ANNUAL FACULTY ASSIGNMENTS

00:35:13.711 --> 00:35:14.912
CLASS 2 HOMEROOM TEACHER
MIKAMI TAKASHI

00:35:15.012 --> 00:35:16.347
CO-HOMEROOM TEACHER
KOREEDA FUMIKA

00:35:17.415 --> 00:35:20.017
– Here you go.
– Thank you.

00:35:20.818 --> 00:35:21.886
What is that?

00:35:26.524 --> 00:35:29.160
– Do I look like this?
– What?

00:35:30.528 --> 00:35:31.896
I do, don't I?

00:35:31.996 --> 00:35:34.599
No, you don't.

00:35:35.166 --> 00:35:37.135
Wait, what's going on with you?

00:35:38.302 --> 00:35:41.072
He showed me this picture
and said that's what I look like.

00:35:42.073 --> 00:35:43.941
Then, he told me to
stand up and fight

00:35:44.041 --> 00:35:45.276
since I was demoted.

00:35:46.310 --> 00:35:49.013
His coming here is the reason
I got replaced

00:35:49.147 --> 00:35:51.149
so how can he even say that?

00:35:51.716 --> 00:35:54.252
And he keeps provoking
the students too.

00:35:54.752 --> 00:35:58.089
It's rare to see you
get this worked up.

00:36:03.261 --> 00:36:04.395
I'm frustrated.

00:36:06.264 --> 00:36:09.700
I finally got to be
a homeroom teacher in my fifth year.

00:36:12.370 --> 00:36:14.705
I wanted to
see them through to graduation.

00:36:16.574 --> 00:36:18.142
I completely understand that.

00:36:20.678 --> 00:36:23.748
Honestly, I don't know.

00:36:26.050 --> 00:36:29.987
Is he an enemy or an ally?

00:36:37.562 --> 00:36:38.896
How is that going?

00:36:38.963 --> 00:36:41.332
Anybody came to your counseling room?

00:36:42.567 --> 00:36:44.202
Quite a few, actually.

00:36:44.302 --> 00:36:49.340
Even at a school
full of rich kids like ours

00:36:49.440 --> 00:36:53.644
there are plenty of students
with complicated family situations.

00:36:54.779 --> 00:36:58.449
Some tie their self-worth
to their test scores.

00:36:58.916 --> 00:37:00.785
Some are crushed under

00:37:00.851 --> 00:37:02.620
their parents'
overwhelming expectations.

00:37:03.654 --> 00:37:07.425
But, they all try so hard.

00:37:08.526 --> 00:37:11.796
All I can do is listen to them,
and that frustrates me.

00:37:15.066 --> 00:37:18.436
Yet, the Basic Act on Education
starts with

00:37:18.536 --> 00:37:22.373
"Education must aim to cultivate
citizens who are mentally

00:37:22.473 --> 00:37:24.909
and physically healthy."

00:37:26.677 --> 00:37:30.481
Completely unfazed by
the changes in the past 80 years

00:37:30.581 --> 00:37:32.783
with no consideration given to
issues like declining birth rates

00:37:32.883 --> 00:37:34.318
or the pressures of entrance exams

00:37:34.418 --> 00:37:37.288
a robust educational curriculum
has been established.

00:37:38.222 --> 00:37:40.691
Three years in an environment
where showing any weakness...

00:37:40.758 --> 00:37:41.859
CONFECTIONARY SHOP
SHIINOHA

00:37:41.926 --> 00:37:45.529
...whether in grades or family
background, means losing...

00:37:46.631 --> 00:37:48.399
Of course their mental health
would suffer.

00:37:49.467 --> 00:37:51.068
It's no surprise.

00:37:53.371 --> 00:37:55.273
APRIL 10 IS TEXTBOOK DAY

00:37:55.373 --> 00:37:58.209
Even if you
don't understand Mr. Mikami

00:37:58.909 --> 00:38:01.779
perhaps you can at least
believe in the word "fight."

00:38:19.263 --> 00:38:22.433
Hey, can I ask you something?

00:38:23.434 --> 00:38:25.803
It's about that new teacher,
Mr. Mikami.

00:38:27.605 --> 00:38:28.606
What would you like?

00:38:29.106 --> 00:38:31.142
Thank you for waiting.

00:38:31.475 --> 00:38:32.910
Thank you.

00:38:33.077 --> 00:38:35.313
Long time no see, Mikami.

00:38:35.680 --> 00:38:37.415
I'm not in Kasumigaseki anymore.

00:38:37.515 --> 00:38:38.716
What? You got transferred?

00:38:38.849 --> 00:38:40.084
It's not exactly a transfer.

00:38:40.451 --> 00:38:42.053
It's more like
a bureaucratic dispatch.

00:38:42.119 --> 00:38:43.587
I'm teaching at a high school.

00:38:43.721 --> 00:38:45.456
Really?

00:38:45.556 --> 00:38:47.625
The Ministry of Education
sure does some interesting things.

00:38:47.725 --> 00:38:48.993
Yeah, I guess.

00:38:49.593 --> 00:38:50.728
Hello!

00:38:50.828 --> 00:38:52.063
Welcome.

00:38:53.431 --> 00:38:54.732
Hey, Mikami.

00:38:56.567 --> 00:38:58.436
What are you doing here?

00:38:59.503 --> 00:39:01.706
I had some business in the city.

00:39:01.806 --> 00:39:05.276
Dinner? Or a late lunch?

00:39:05.676 --> 00:39:07.345
Late lunch, unfortunately.

00:39:07.945 --> 00:39:11.248
Why don't you join us?
Can we get a table?

00:39:11.415 --> 00:39:12.683
Of course.

00:39:22.426 --> 00:39:23.828
So, how's school?

00:39:25.529 --> 00:39:27.598
It hasn't even been a week yet.

00:39:27.798 --> 00:39:30.067
Teaching still feels
like playing pretend.

00:39:30.167 --> 00:39:32.737
Oh, you're already teaching?

00:39:32.803 --> 00:39:34.071
Makes sense, I guess.

00:39:34.505 --> 00:39:35.506
Yeah.

00:39:36.841 --> 00:39:38.943
Good thing my subject is math.

00:39:39.076 --> 00:39:41.278
Does that matter?

00:39:41.379 --> 00:39:42.580
It's a super elite school

00:39:42.646 --> 00:39:44.482
with lots of kids
who came back from abroad.

00:39:44.982 --> 00:39:47.518
If it were English,
there are probably lots of students

00:39:47.585 --> 00:39:49.053
who are better than the teachers.

00:39:49.153 --> 00:39:50.421
That sounds terrifying.

00:39:50.654 --> 00:39:53.023
They can't be smarter
than you, Mikami.

00:39:53.657 --> 00:39:54.859
I wonder.

00:39:58.129 --> 00:40:00.364
Rintoku has been the top school
in the prefecture for years, right?

00:40:00.464 --> 00:40:02.700
In terms of Tokyo University
acceptance rate, that is.

00:40:03.000 --> 00:40:04.001
Yeah.

00:40:04.101 --> 00:40:06.437
It's only been around
for 20 years or so.

00:40:06.537 --> 00:40:08.706
That's pretty remarkable.

00:40:08.806 --> 00:40:12.276
Right. The founder, Mr. Kodai,
has been praised as

00:40:12.410 --> 00:40:15.913
a charismatic chairman.
He's been on TV a lot lately.

00:40:16.013 --> 00:40:17.815
But there's a reason for it.

00:40:18.449 --> 00:40:19.450
A reason?

00:40:19.550 --> 00:40:23.087
The school itself
runs prep courses after school.

00:40:23.187 --> 00:40:25.022
They call it an
"on-campus cram school."

00:40:25.222 --> 00:40:28.692
Right, I've heard of those.
They've become more common lately.

00:40:28.793 --> 00:40:31.729
The school buys lectures
from cram schools

00:40:31.829 --> 00:40:35.332
so students can take
prep courses without leaving campus.

00:40:35.433 --> 00:40:39.003
Rintoku started as a cram school
called "Rintoku Seminar."

00:40:39.203 --> 00:40:41.272
They provide full support

00:40:41.372 --> 00:40:43.340
so it's way more extensive
than other schools.

00:40:43.441 --> 00:40:45.276
Now is the time!

00:40:45.376 --> 00:40:47.678
That's why it's so popular now.

00:40:47.778 --> 00:40:49.980
No wonder Rintoku is so competitive.

00:40:51.982 --> 00:40:53.784
Look, enough about that.

00:40:54.151 --> 00:40:55.152
Instead of talking about a school

00:40:55.252 --> 00:40:56.987
that buys its way
into Tokyo University

00:40:57.221 --> 00:40:59.323
shouldn't you be
focusing on something else?

00:40:59.824 --> 00:41:00.825
What?

00:41:01.492 --> 00:41:05.129
Is that really what you think about
the school you were assigned to?

00:41:11.035 --> 00:41:12.770
– Thanks for the meal.
– Leaving already?

00:41:12.870 --> 00:41:14.205
It's fine, I'll pay.

00:41:14.305 --> 00:41:15.873
We're celebrating your new position.

00:41:16.507 --> 00:41:17.508
What?

00:41:17.741 --> 00:41:20.010
You got your position
by selling me out, didn't you?

00:41:20.244 --> 00:41:21.612
So I should congratulate you.

00:41:22.413 --> 00:41:24.114
– It's 4,500 yen.
– Here you go.

00:41:25.883 --> 00:41:27.785
– See you.
– Thank you.

00:41:30.955 --> 00:41:32.857
He's got a bad attitude.

00:41:34.658 --> 00:41:36.560
Was he always like that?

00:41:36.694 --> 00:41:39.597
Well, he was never
the super-friendly type.

00:41:39.697 --> 00:41:41.966
Considering how much he wanted to
see things on the ground

00:41:42.099 --> 00:41:44.602
he should be grateful, if anything.

00:41:47.371 --> 00:41:48.372
Excuse me...

00:41:48.472 --> 00:41:49.573
Yeah, what?

00:41:50.374 --> 00:41:54.044
You weren't the one
who reported Mr. Mikami, were you?

00:41:57.047 --> 00:42:01.619
And if I were,
would there be a problem?

00:42:02.386 --> 00:42:03.387
Well...

00:42:04.855 --> 00:42:06.223
I'm kidding.

00:42:06.323 --> 00:42:08.959
But with that attitude,
even the mild-mannered Mr. Makino

00:42:09.059 --> 00:42:10.394
would get irritated.

00:42:10.961 --> 00:42:14.031
Come on. Don't scare me like that!

00:42:30.748 --> 00:42:32.449
I'm home.

00:42:32.550 --> 00:42:34.785
Hi, Fumika. Have you eaten?

00:42:34.885 --> 00:42:36.153
Yes, I have.

00:42:36.754 --> 00:42:38.322
If you're eating out, let us know.

00:42:39.189 --> 00:42:40.291
That's common sense.

00:42:40.591 --> 00:42:41.592
Yes.

00:42:41.692 --> 00:42:42.960
It's fine.

00:42:43.661 --> 00:42:46.063
As someone in a teaching position

00:42:46.430 --> 00:42:48.966
you need to conduct
yourself accordingly.

00:42:51.602 --> 00:42:53.270
I apologize.

00:43:40.184 --> 00:43:41.819
Shall we?

00:44:06.777 --> 00:44:08.045
All right!

00:44:14.985 --> 00:44:16.020
Do you come here often?

00:44:17.688 --> 00:44:19.023
Wait, were you following me?

00:44:19.123 --> 00:44:20.424
No, of course not.

00:44:21.525 --> 00:44:23.961
Since we're here,
can we talk for a bit?

00:44:26.163 --> 00:44:28.432
Buy me a crepe.

00:44:42.680 --> 00:44:44.314
– Here you go.
– Thank you.

00:44:44.415 --> 00:44:46.717
– No problem.
– Let's eat!

00:44:51.855 --> 00:44:53.557
Do you play games every day?

00:44:54.158 --> 00:44:55.259
Is that bad?

00:44:55.392 --> 00:44:57.194
No, I didn't say that.

00:44:57.795 --> 00:45:00.998
It's not like
I don't have a place at home

00:45:01.065 --> 00:45:03.067
so you needn't worry.

00:45:03.467 --> 00:45:06.870
For me, this is just to
shift gears up here.

00:45:07.271 --> 00:45:10.140
Fighting games
do stimulate the brain.

00:45:10.240 --> 00:45:11.742
Especially when played
face-to-face.

00:45:13.477 --> 00:45:17.681
But right now, Okami, you're not
stimulating my brain cells at all.

00:45:17.781 --> 00:45:18.849
"Okami"?

00:45:18.982 --> 00:45:20.084
Your nickname.

00:45:20.184 --> 00:45:22.419
It's bound to happen if you're
a bureaucrat with a name like Mikami.

00:45:22.786 --> 00:45:24.822
Everyone calls you that
behind your back.

00:45:27.524 --> 00:45:30.661
Okami, huh? Really?

00:45:32.529 --> 00:45:34.598
Makes sense.

00:45:36.734 --> 00:45:38.802
So, is this about Kanzaki?

00:45:40.504 --> 00:45:42.005
You two are childhood friends, right?

00:45:42.072 --> 00:45:45.776
Yeah. But that doesn't mean
I have anything to say about him.

00:45:45.943 --> 00:45:49.646
You probably already have
more data on him than I do.

00:45:51.181 --> 00:45:52.783
Was he always like that?

00:45:53.217 --> 00:45:54.218
No way.

00:45:54.284 --> 00:45:56.353
If there were a kid like that,
it'd be terrifying.

00:45:57.888 --> 00:45:59.823
So there was a time
when he was innocent?

00:46:00.290 --> 00:46:04.661
No, I don't think I ever saw
an innocent side to Kanzaki.

00:46:05.729 --> 00:46:06.864
So he acted like an adult?

00:46:06.930 --> 00:46:08.966
Not quite that either.

00:46:10.067 --> 00:46:12.936
He was good at
wearing the mask of an adult?

00:46:13.070 --> 00:46:15.873
Wow, that's a
stylishly perfect answer!

00:46:17.975 --> 00:46:20.511
You're worried about him,
aren't you, Tominaga?

00:46:20.778 --> 00:46:22.880
Well, we were childhood friends.

00:46:23.847 --> 00:46:26.483
But Kanzaki doesn't really
understand himself.

00:46:26.583 --> 00:46:27.718
I feel uneasy watching him.

00:46:27.785 --> 00:46:29.052
He's always acting tough.

00:46:31.555 --> 00:46:33.090
Care for a rematch?

00:46:33.290 --> 00:46:34.291
Sure.

00:46:34.658 --> 00:46:36.994
But you'll have to step up your game.

00:46:37.127 --> 00:46:39.730
If you don't,
it won't be worth it for me.

00:46:39.830 --> 00:46:40.831
Got it.

00:46:43.667 --> 00:46:44.802
Thanks for this.

00:47:12.296 --> 00:47:13.997
– Good morning.
– Morning.

00:47:18.936 --> 00:47:20.170
Wait. He's a criminal?

00:47:29.046 --> 00:47:31.348
– Mr. Mikami!
– Yes?

00:47:31.815 --> 00:47:32.816
Come with me.

00:47:34.518 --> 00:47:36.687
Is this true?

00:47:41.291 --> 00:47:42.526
Please explain yourself.

00:47:42.626 --> 00:47:45.062
– I'll explain in the classroom.
– What?

00:47:47.598 --> 00:47:49.700
– No way!
– Seriously?

00:47:49.800 --> 00:47:52.135
– That's nuts!
– I can't believe it.

00:47:52.536 --> 00:47:53.537
Look at this!

00:47:55.239 --> 00:47:58.208
I knew it.

00:47:58.742 --> 00:48:00.110
It was only a matter of time.

00:48:00.210 --> 00:48:01.211
What's going on?

00:48:06.083 --> 00:48:10.587
Rintoku Newspaper
Mr. Mikami is a Criminal!

00:48:10.687 --> 00:48:14.224
Darkness Within
the Ministry of Education

00:48:20.964 --> 00:48:22.666
Hey, Okami is coming!

00:48:33.911 --> 00:48:34.945
Good morning.

00:48:36.847 --> 00:48:38.348
I'll get straight to the point.

00:48:40.417 --> 00:48:42.019
This article is mostly true.

00:48:42.352 --> 00:48:43.353
What?

00:48:45.522 --> 00:48:49.826
Last year, there were
three illicit retiree placements

00:48:49.927 --> 00:48:52.062
from the Ministry of Education
to a private research institution.

00:48:52.129 --> 00:48:53.163
Are you aware of that?

00:48:54.331 --> 00:48:57.734
It didn't lead to criminal charges
due to a lack of evidence

00:48:58.235 --> 00:49:00.237
but someone in the ministry
leaked that

00:49:00.337 --> 00:49:02.306
I was the one
brokering those placements.

00:49:03.140 --> 00:49:05.242
So, I was dispatched to this school

00:49:05.342 --> 00:49:08.078
through the bureaucratic system
until things settle down.

00:49:11.048 --> 00:49:13.317
The person who wrote this article

00:49:14.151 --> 00:49:15.285
was you, Kanzaki.

00:49:17.254 --> 00:49:19.623
Is there anyone else
who could have dug this deep?

00:49:20.490 --> 00:49:21.558
How did you get this information?

00:49:21.692 --> 00:49:24.161
A journalist never reveals
their sources. It's basic journalism.

00:49:25.629 --> 00:49:28.265
Well, in a school like this,
I'm sure there are bureaucrats

00:49:28.365 --> 00:49:30.634
among your parents,
siblings, and alumni.

00:49:36.840 --> 00:49:40.644
Kanzaki, what exactly do you
want to achieve in journalism?

00:49:42.579 --> 00:49:43.580
What?

00:49:43.680 --> 00:49:47.184
Your father is a renowned
newspaper journalist, isn't he?

00:49:47.351 --> 00:49:49.586
Hold on, that's
personal information...

00:49:49.686 --> 00:49:52.255
He is the one who brought up
my personal information first.

00:49:55.192 --> 00:49:56.560
So what if he is?

00:49:57.461 --> 00:50:01.131
Are you writing articles like that
out of rebellion against your father?

00:50:02.332 --> 00:50:05.135
You know about
the press clubs, right?

00:50:05.235 --> 00:50:06.236
Of course.

00:50:07.771 --> 00:50:08.972
There are press clubs

00:50:09.072 --> 00:50:11.074
in both the National Diet
and the police force

00:50:11.174 --> 00:50:14.177
where the media sits obediently,
waiting for official announcements.

00:50:15.078 --> 00:50:16.947
They then publish
near-identical articles

00:50:17.047 --> 00:50:19.716
just with slight variations
in wording.

00:50:20.484 --> 00:50:22.319
Of course they would, right?

00:50:22.552 --> 00:50:24.254
After all, they all
have the same source.

00:50:24.321 --> 00:50:27.691
Exactly. It's Japan's unique
and wonderful system.

00:50:27.924 --> 00:50:30.427
Thanks to that, Japan ranks
dead last in press freedom

00:50:30.527 --> 00:50:32.262
among the G7 countries.

00:50:32.963 --> 00:50:36.566
My father spends his days
just standing around

00:50:36.700 --> 00:50:38.468
waiting for news
in one of those clubs.

00:50:38.702 --> 00:50:40.303
No point rebelling against
someone like that.

00:50:40.370 --> 00:50:41.371
So?

00:50:42.539 --> 00:50:44.141
I refuse to be like him.

00:50:45.542 --> 00:50:47.878
Press clubs are ridiculous.

00:50:47.944 --> 00:50:49.179
They need to be abolished.

00:50:49.279 --> 00:50:52.015
Things would have changed easily
if ideals are all that's needed.

00:50:52.115 --> 00:50:54.151
How will you change a system
that has remained unchanged

00:50:54.251 --> 00:50:55.852
for over a hundred years
dating back to the Meiji era?

00:50:56.987 --> 00:51:00.590
By conducting proper investigations
and writing original articles.

00:51:01.691 --> 00:51:03.093
I'll become a journalist
worthy of signing my own name

00:51:03.193 --> 00:51:04.594
at the end of my articles.

00:51:04.694 --> 00:51:06.863
By doing that, I will change
Japan's press system.

00:51:06.963 --> 00:51:08.732
You claim to have such high ideals

00:51:08.799 --> 00:51:12.269
yet you didn't bother
to interview me or fact-check.

00:51:12.669 --> 00:51:15.272
What you wound up writing
was this gossip article.

00:51:15.639 --> 00:51:17.107
Don't you think that's strange?

00:51:18.542 --> 00:51:20.811
Gossip article?
What part of it is gossip?

00:51:21.044 --> 00:51:22.846
Why don't you interview me now?

00:51:23.013 --> 00:51:24.347
I'll answer anything.

00:51:25.649 --> 00:51:28.552
What? This is ridiculous.

00:51:29.553 --> 00:51:31.555
It's quite the rare opportunity

00:51:31.721 --> 00:51:33.723
for a bureaucrat to
answer everything willingly.

00:51:33.824 --> 00:51:36.626
Are you really going to
dismiss it as ridiculous?

00:51:57.114 --> 00:52:02.252
Earlier, you said,
"Most of it is true," didn't you?

00:52:02.619 --> 00:52:04.654
Then which parts aren't true?

00:52:05.555 --> 00:52:07.924
It's true that I took responsibility
for the illegal retiree placements

00:52:08.024 --> 00:52:09.025
and came here.

00:52:09.459 --> 00:52:13.864
But strangely enough, I have
no memory of actually doing it.

00:52:13.997 --> 00:52:15.999
Do you really think
that lie is going to fly?

00:52:17.300 --> 00:52:18.502
Think about it.

00:52:20.070 --> 00:52:21.138
About what?

00:52:21.972 --> 00:52:25.775
If what I'm saying is true,
what really happened?

00:52:26.510 --> 00:52:28.478
Are you suggesting
someone framed you?

00:52:28.578 --> 00:52:29.946
It's a reasonable assumption.

00:52:30.247 --> 00:52:31.815
Then, why did you accept it?

00:52:32.015 --> 00:52:33.783
Because I wanted to stay
in the Ministry of Education.

00:52:34.084 --> 00:52:35.485
Why did you want to stay?

00:52:36.119 --> 00:52:39.823
I joined the Ministry of Education
to reform the education system.

00:52:39.990 --> 00:52:43.126
I wasn't going to leave
without accomplishing anything.

00:52:45.028 --> 00:52:46.062
I see.

00:52:46.763 --> 00:52:49.599
And the first thing you did was
cover for someone else's corruption?

00:52:50.500 --> 00:52:51.735
Isn't that contradictory?

00:52:53.203 --> 00:52:54.804
I told you.

00:52:54.871 --> 00:52:58.108
Things would have changed easily
if ideals are all you need.

00:52:58.842 --> 00:53:00.377
If a bureaucrat
wants to climb the ranks

00:53:00.443 --> 00:53:02.345
they can't do it with clean hands.

00:53:02.445 --> 00:53:05.081
They need to
master bureaucratic doublespeak

00:53:05.182 --> 00:53:07.484
and handle
political orders instantly.

00:53:08.018 --> 00:53:10.987
They push their ideals aside to
finally earn the right

00:53:11.087 --> 00:53:14.357
to participate in
this country's administration.

00:53:16.960 --> 00:53:18.161
Maybe.

00:53:22.566 --> 00:53:24.167
Kanzaki.

00:53:24.634 --> 00:53:29.573
The things you exposed
weren't some grand conspiracy.

00:53:33.410 --> 00:53:34.945
They're just everyday occurrences.

00:53:38.181 --> 00:53:41.084
Like those
morning routine videos on YouTube.

00:53:45.922 --> 00:53:48.925
When it's as plain as day,
you don't call it "darkness."

00:54:00.203 --> 00:54:01.671
Let me ask all of you something.

00:54:04.007 --> 00:54:06.643
The female teacher Kanzaki exposed
for having an affair...

00:54:07.110 --> 00:54:09.980
She resigned voluntarily
and later got divorced.

00:54:10.580 --> 00:54:11.681
As for the male teacher--

00:54:11.748 --> 00:54:14.184
He was transferred to
an affiliated prep school.

00:54:14.918 --> 00:54:18.054
Why was it the female teacher
who quit and not the male teacher?

00:54:18.154 --> 00:54:20.156
What does that
have to do with anything?

00:54:20.290 --> 00:54:22.325
It's about the life you destroyed.

00:54:22.459 --> 00:54:25.262
I couldn't care less about the life
of a teacher who has an affair.

00:54:28.098 --> 00:54:29.933
"The personal is political."

00:54:31.601 --> 00:54:32.602
What?

00:54:34.004 --> 00:54:36.373
The personal is political.

00:54:38.642 --> 00:54:39.976
I know that phrase.

00:54:40.076 --> 00:54:41.978
Then why did you just spread gossip?

00:54:42.078 --> 00:54:43.613
Why didn't you use your imagination?

00:54:52.889 --> 00:54:54.124
I already told you.

00:54:55.925 --> 00:54:58.261
This so-called "elite"
you all are striving to become

00:54:58.328 --> 00:55:00.430
is just a future upper-class citizen.

00:55:04.334 --> 00:55:06.569
How do you all feel
while studying for these exams?

00:55:09.239 --> 00:55:14.010
You push through
an impossibly brutal competition

00:55:14.144 --> 00:55:16.446
only to become
an upper-class citizen at the end.

00:55:16.546 --> 00:55:17.814
Are you fine with that?

00:55:22.018 --> 00:55:23.119
I told you before.

00:55:24.854 --> 00:55:27.324
"Elite" means "chosen by God."

00:55:28.458 --> 00:55:29.893
And why are they chosen?

00:55:31.828 --> 00:55:34.798
Because they can resist
the desires and egos

00:55:34.898 --> 00:55:36.766
that would make
an ordinary person falter.

00:55:37.033 --> 00:55:39.769
Because they dedicate themselves
to others and to a greater cause

00:55:39.836 --> 00:55:41.304
not just their own gain.

00:55:43.540 --> 00:55:45.408
And to that,
I'd like to add one more thing.

00:55:47.944 --> 00:55:50.380
A true elite would
dedicate themselves

00:55:52.615 --> 00:55:54.317
to helping the weak.

00:55:59.923 --> 00:56:01.758
A political journalist
who panders to politicians

00:56:01.825 --> 00:56:03.960
and a journalist who disregards
the life of a teacher

00:56:04.027 --> 00:56:05.161
caught in an affair...

00:56:07.530 --> 00:56:10.633
I don't see how
they're any different.

00:56:20.844 --> 00:56:22.879
I'm done with this farce.

00:56:23.980 --> 00:56:27.350
Kanzaki, don't you want
to reveal the darkness?

00:56:30.387 --> 00:56:31.388
What?

00:56:31.855 --> 00:56:34.624
If you do, you couldn't find
a better source than me.

00:56:39.362 --> 00:56:40.563
Don't let me go.

00:56:46.503 --> 00:56:48.972
If you really want a glimpse
into the darkness

00:56:49.639 --> 00:56:52.542
meet me here after school today.

00:57:07.190 --> 00:57:08.892
I sincerely apologize.

00:57:09.025 --> 00:57:11.394
I never expected this
to be exposed in such a way.

00:57:11.494 --> 00:57:14.964
– What did the parents say?
– They haven't arrived yet.

00:57:15.064 --> 00:57:16.566
This won't just go away.

00:57:18.134 --> 00:57:20.203
Should we have him step down
as homeroom teacher?

00:57:20.336 --> 00:57:23.072
That's not an option.
I told you already.

00:57:23.173 --> 00:57:24.507
Yes, I understand.

00:57:28.978 --> 00:57:30.880
Put out this fire.

00:57:31.080 --> 00:57:34.150
Otherwise, there will be
no reason for you to be here.

00:57:35.485 --> 00:57:36.486
Understood.

00:57:43.493 --> 00:57:45.662
That's all for today.
See you next week.

00:57:46.062 --> 00:57:47.664
Thank you very much.

00:57:51.801 --> 00:57:53.169
Will I be okay for the test?

00:57:57.607 --> 00:57:58.942
So, Kanzaki is really leaving?

00:57:59.776 --> 00:58:01.611
After getting called out
like that, yeah.

00:58:04.881 --> 00:58:07.217
Someone from
Mikami's homeroom class did this.

00:58:07.317 --> 00:58:09.719
Wow, impressive.

00:58:10.253 --> 00:58:12.055
They've got
great investigative skills.

00:58:12.822 --> 00:58:15.992
But if we just let this go

00:58:16.259 --> 00:58:18.294
Pandora's Box might open,
don't you think?

00:58:19.629 --> 00:58:23.132
What? Pandora's Box?
What do you mean?

00:58:23.233 --> 00:58:25.502
I think you already know.

00:58:25.935 --> 00:58:30.740
The box that contains
all misfortunes and calamities.

00:58:32.775 --> 00:58:34.511
You're devious.

00:58:36.346 --> 00:58:38.715
Don't say such ominous things.

00:58:38.915 --> 00:58:43.219
So, before it opens,
I'll take care of it.

00:58:44.988 --> 00:58:46.122
All right.

00:58:48.324 --> 00:58:50.059
There's someone I want you to meet.

00:58:50.727 --> 00:58:52.795
I think they can be of help.

00:58:56.366 --> 00:58:57.634
Understood, sir.

00:59:38.641 --> 00:59:41.144
Bureaucrats really
are the worst, aren't they?

00:59:41.244 --> 00:59:43.580
Wasn't it Kanzaki
who broke the scoop again?

00:59:43.646 --> 00:59:44.647
He's amazing.

00:59:44.781 --> 00:59:49.085
But is this really a scoop, though?

00:59:49.185 --> 00:59:50.787
It's a huge scoop.

01:01:26.115 --> 01:01:27.116
Have a seat.

01:01:47.770 --> 01:01:49.739
How was that even gossip?

01:01:51.741 --> 01:01:55.545
I've sat through countless
press conferences in my line of work.

01:01:56.779 --> 01:01:59.415
No bureaucrat would be
kind enough to tell you the truth

01:01:59.515 --> 01:02:00.850
if you ask like that.

01:02:03.252 --> 01:02:07.657
But now, I happen to be
an exceptionally kind teacher.

01:02:27.477 --> 01:02:29.011
Ms. Saejima.

01:02:32.248 --> 01:02:34.884
After her affair was exposed,
she was forced out of the school.

01:02:34.984 --> 01:02:37.386
Her husband divorced her
and now she works there.

01:02:39.455 --> 01:02:42.091
These photos prove that the life
you dismissed as insignificant

01:02:42.191 --> 01:02:44.761
is still quietly going on.

01:02:53.603 --> 01:02:54.704
So what?

01:02:56.806 --> 01:02:58.775
You've heard about
the murder that occurred

01:02:58.875 --> 01:03:01.077
during this year's
national civil service exam, right?

01:03:02.979 --> 01:03:04.881
Some third-rate university student
took the exam

01:03:04.947 --> 01:03:07.183
she had no chance of passing,
and ended up killing

01:03:07.283 --> 01:03:09.819
a Tokyo University student
who was a shoo-in to pass.

01:03:11.754 --> 01:03:15.024
What if that case is
connected to your article?

01:03:18.127 --> 01:03:19.128
What?

01:03:19.862 --> 01:03:21.564
I realized something.

01:03:23.232 --> 01:03:24.634
Right there, in the darkness.

01:03:26.335 --> 01:03:29.205
That the incident,
my misconduct, this school

01:03:30.506 --> 01:03:31.874
and the Ministry of Education...

01:03:34.043 --> 01:03:36.112
They might all be connected.

01:03:41.717 --> 01:03:43.586
The Butterfly Effect.

01:03:44.387 --> 01:03:45.922
You've heard of it, haven't you?

01:03:47.456 --> 01:03:49.458
A butterfly flaps its wings in Brazil

01:03:50.092 --> 01:03:51.828
and a tornado forms in Texas.

01:03:52.929 --> 01:03:54.564
Small events can trigger
a chain reaction

01:03:54.630 --> 01:03:56.966
leading to something much bigger.

01:03:57.733 --> 01:04:00.102
It's a well-known chaos theory.

01:04:01.404 --> 01:04:05.908
But the most important part
is that the butterfly in Brazil

01:04:06.409 --> 01:04:09.111
has no idea that its wings
might have caused a tornado...

01:04:09.178 --> 01:04:13.649
killing many people and animals.

01:04:17.753 --> 01:04:19.288
People can take lives

01:04:20.690 --> 01:04:22.558
without even realizing it.

01:04:24.227 --> 01:04:26.462
Because the butterfly is
just flapping its wings.

01:04:29.665 --> 01:04:30.867
I told you, didn't I?

01:04:32.668 --> 01:04:35.905
If you really want to see into
the darkness, do not let me go.

01:04:46.849 --> 01:04:52.722
Why do you even care about me?

01:05:02.965 --> 01:05:04.533
Maybe it's because you are like him.

01:05:06.135 --> 01:05:07.136
What?

01:05:09.972 --> 01:05:11.540
You really are like him.

01:05:14.010 --> 01:05:16.812
I meant to right what is wrong.

01:05:26.188 --> 01:05:28.858
That's why I can't abandon you.

01:07:57.506 --> 01:07:59.675
I wouldn't die over
something like that.

01:07:59.775 --> 01:08:01.110
Let me think about it with you.

01:08:01.210 --> 01:08:04.180
This should be considered part of
Japan's education system as a whole.

01:08:04.280 --> 01:08:07.116
What education needs now
is not an upgrade, but a rebuild.
