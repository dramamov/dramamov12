00:01:44.851 --> 00:01:47.410
(Adapted from the Jinjiang novel
"Light Beyond the Reed" by Mo Shubai)

00:01:48.220 --> 00:01:51.220
=Episode 13=

00:01:52.410 --> 00:01:53.250
Mom.

00:01:56.850 --> 00:01:57.130
Mom.

00:01:57.130 --> 00:01:58.100
Come in, quickly.

00:01:58.930 --> 00:02:00.210
- Dad.
- Have you eaten?

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:00.770
Sit down.

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:01.980
- What happened?
- Sit down.

00:02:01.980 --> 00:02:02.660
Come, sit.

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:04.330
Sit, and I'll tell you.

00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:05.170
Sit.

00:02:05.844 --> 00:02:06.660
It's nothing serious.

00:02:06.660 --> 00:02:08.100
- What's wrong?
- It's fine.

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:09.260
It's fine.

00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:13.170
Nianwen's been

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:15.610
acting a bit strange lately.

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:17.260
He's not eating well

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:18.340
and not sleeping well.

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:20.450
All he thinks about
is his sister's matter.

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:22.850
He keeps saying
he must seek justice for her.

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:24.410
He's right to feel that way.

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:25.730
But you know,

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:26.490
we...

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:29.260
We can't fight those
who have power, can we?

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:30.540
I'm just worried that if he...

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:31.380
Mom.

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:32.600
Please don't worry too much.

00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:35.170
I'll go and talk to Nianwen later.

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:36.260
That's good.

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:39.340
How's Sibei doing now?

00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:41.570
She...

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:43.100
She's a bit tired.

00:02:43.711 --> 00:02:44.940
She hasn't got much strength.

00:02:45.820 --> 00:02:46.850
But don't worry, Mom.

00:02:47.044 --> 00:02:48.540
We've already been to the hospital.

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:50.380
The doctor said it's nothing serious.

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:51.780
See?

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:52.610
I told her...

00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:53.500
Don't talk.

00:02:56.220 --> 00:02:58.340
She's just keeping
everything bottled up.

00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:00.890
I know her too well.

00:03:01.511 --> 00:03:03.170
She's been stubborn
since she was little.

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:04.540
When she gets in a mood,

00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:06.450
she won't talk for days.

00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:07.380
I had no choice.

00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:08.500
I'd buy her an apple,

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:10.200
steam it for her, and she'd eat...

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:13.450
How could I forget that?

00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:15.260
I'll go and buy some apples now.

00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:16.450
- Sit here.
- Mom.

00:03:16.450 --> 00:03:16.940
I'll go now.

00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:18.060
She can't eat anything.

00:03:18.290 --> 00:03:19.130
She has to eat.

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:20.220
We all have to eat.

00:03:20.488 --> 00:03:22.066
Our whole family needs to let this go

00:03:22.088 --> 00:03:23.010
as soon as possible.

00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:24.220
You wait here.

00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:25.100
I'll be right back.

00:03:33.450 --> 00:03:34.340
Busy right now.

00:03:37.340 --> 00:03:38.540
Wangwang.

00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:43.130
Wangwang's back.

00:04:12.220 --> 00:04:12.980
Guifen.

00:04:12.980 --> 00:04:14.060
Doing some grocery shopping?

00:04:15.780 --> 00:04:16.730
Ms. Li.

00:04:16.755 --> 00:04:18.340
Why are you running the stall today?

00:04:18.340 --> 00:04:19.340
Where's Zhang?

00:04:19.850 --> 00:04:22.290
Guifen, he hasn't been able
to get up early lately.

00:04:22.290 --> 00:04:23.290
So we swapped shifts.

00:04:23.410 --> 00:04:24.250
What would you like?

00:04:24.980 --> 00:04:25.820
Some apples.

00:04:25.911 --> 00:04:27.177
- Sure.
- Which one's better?

00:04:30.980 --> 00:04:32.490
Pick the big ones.

00:04:33.700 --> 00:04:34.580
Alright.

00:04:35.980 --> 00:04:37.250
Sixteen yuan fifty.

00:04:37.730 --> 00:04:38.850
Just make it sixteen.

00:04:42.170 --> 00:04:43.020
Thanks.

00:04:45.460 --> 00:04:46.300
All set.

00:04:46.980 --> 00:04:48.730
Take care, Guifen.

00:04:51.900 --> 00:04:53.250
You know her family well?

00:04:53.610 --> 00:04:54.980
Yeah, quite well.

00:04:55.088 --> 00:04:56.410
Well, about her daughter's case...

00:04:56.410 --> 00:04:57.250
Is it true?

00:04:57.460 --> 00:04:58.660
The court's already ruled.

00:04:58.850 --> 00:05:00.370
Her daughter, Sibei,

00:05:00.370 --> 00:05:01.980
has never been obedient.

00:05:01.980 --> 00:05:04.140
Always talking back to her mom.

00:05:04.140 --> 00:05:05.290
Wild sort of girl.

00:05:05.290 --> 00:05:06.130
Li Mingyu!

00:05:07.400 --> 00:05:08.570
What did you just say?

00:05:09.050 --> 00:05:10.290
Guifen.

00:05:10.290 --> 00:05:11.580
I didn't say anything.

00:05:13.410 --> 00:05:14.250
Say that again.

00:05:15.100 --> 00:05:16.460
What's the matter?

00:05:16.460 --> 00:05:17.730
Can't we even talk now?

00:05:19.340 --> 00:05:21.660
Huang Guifen, stop causing trouble here!

00:05:23.370 --> 00:05:24.540
Over there.

00:05:27.250 --> 00:05:28.250
Stop fighting! Stop!

00:05:29.490 --> 00:05:30.580
Here, this way!

00:05:31.250 --> 00:05:32.540
Excuse me.

00:05:33.022 --> 00:05:33.730
Stop fighting!

00:05:33.730 --> 00:05:34.490
Mom!

00:05:34.490 --> 00:05:35.330
Stop fighting!

00:05:35.490 --> 00:05:36.370
Stop it, Mom!

00:05:37.140 --> 00:05:38.290
So you've brought backup too?

00:05:38.290 --> 00:05:38.930
Stop it!

00:05:38.930 --> 00:05:39.770
Guifen!

00:05:42.370 --> 00:05:43.900
You've no conscience left, have you?

00:05:45.140 --> 00:05:45.980
Tell me.

00:05:46.220 --> 00:05:48.290
I must've been blind.

00:05:48.290 --> 00:05:50.460
Others badmouth Sibei,

00:05:50.460 --> 00:05:51.660
and you join in, do you?

00:05:51.660 --> 00:05:53.610
Do you even know what's right or wrong?

00:05:53.610 --> 00:05:55.730
Even if others don't know Sibei, you do!

00:05:55.730 --> 00:05:57.580
My Sibei's been a good child

00:05:57.580 --> 00:05:58.810
since the day she was born!

00:05:58.810 --> 00:06:00.290
She's always done well at school!

00:06:00.290 --> 00:06:02.020
She's always been a model student!

00:06:02.020 --> 00:06:03.490
She's always come top of her class!

00:06:04.540 --> 00:06:06.850
When your family
first moved into the city,

00:06:06.850 --> 00:06:08.400
your child couldn't keep up at school.

00:06:08.400 --> 00:06:09.580
Who tutored your kid?

00:06:09.580 --> 00:06:11.660
How long did your kid
eat at our table?

00:06:11.660 --> 00:06:13.050
You've forgotten that, haven't you?

00:06:13.050 --> 00:06:13.850
And now you...

00:06:13.850 --> 00:06:15.490
- Have you no conscience left?
- Mom!

00:06:15.980 --> 00:06:17.140
Do you have any shame at all?

00:06:17.340 --> 00:06:19.100
Look at the mess
you've made of my stall!

00:06:19.100 --> 00:06:20.239
You'll pay for that!

00:06:20.240 --> 00:06:21.410
Fine, how much? I'll pay you!

00:06:21.410 --> 00:06:22.290
At least five hundred!

00:06:22.290 --> 00:06:23.850
Money's all you care about, isn't it?

00:06:29.810 --> 00:06:30.650
Here!

00:06:35.220 --> 00:06:36.060
Mom.

00:06:37.100 --> 00:06:37.940
Move aside.

00:06:39.930 --> 00:06:41.088
Li Mingyu, listen to me.

00:06:42.020 --> 00:06:43.020
My daughter

00:06:43.700 --> 00:06:44.540
has been wronged.

00:06:45.250 --> 00:06:46.660
We'll keep appealing.

00:06:47.700 --> 00:06:50.290
Until that scum ends up in prison.

00:06:50.930 --> 00:06:51.930
Do you hear me?

00:06:57.610 --> 00:06:58.450
Mom.

00:06:58.777 --> 00:07:00.444
- Let's go home.
- And all of you!

00:07:01.340 --> 00:07:02.930
I'm warning every single one of you!

00:07:03.540 --> 00:07:06.540
From now on, if anyone dares

00:07:06.540 --> 00:07:08.290
to speak ill of my daughter again,

00:07:08.930 --> 00:07:10.540
I'll tear your mouth apart!

00:07:12.290 --> 00:07:13.340
Mom, let's go home.

00:07:13.610 --> 00:07:14.450
Let's go home.

00:07:18.490 --> 00:07:20.100
- Stop staring, everyone.
- Calm down.

00:07:20.610 --> 00:07:21.450
Forget it.

00:07:22.100 --> 00:07:22.900
Calm down, Ms. Li.

00:07:22.900 --> 00:07:24.000
Alright, disperse now.

00:07:24.490 --> 00:07:26.930
- Calm down.
- Nothing to see. Move along.

00:07:27.490 --> 00:07:28.610
Go on.

00:07:28.610 --> 00:07:29.450
It's over now.

00:07:32.220 --> 00:07:32.930
Mom.

00:07:32.930 --> 00:07:34.220
Have a sip of water. Calm down.

00:07:34.220 --> 00:07:34.980
I'm fine.

00:07:34.980 --> 00:07:36.460
Put it there. Sit down.

00:07:37.140 --> 00:07:37.980
Sit.

00:07:39.490 --> 00:07:40.490
Guifen,

00:07:40.930 --> 00:07:43.340
you and Ms. Li are usually so close.

00:07:43.955 --> 00:07:45.900
So why are you fighting with her
in public today?

00:07:46.930 --> 00:07:48.490
Aren't you ashamed?

00:07:48.490 --> 00:07:50.930
After all, I was a teacher once.

00:07:51.580 --> 00:07:53.900
Consider my reputation, will you?

00:07:53.900 --> 00:07:54.900
Fine, call me a shrew.

00:07:55.644 --> 00:07:56.930
I've embarrassed you, have I?

00:07:57.580 --> 00:07:58.810
You always side

00:07:58.810 --> 00:07:59.900
with whoever's doing well

00:07:59.900 --> 00:08:01.190
and go with whoever flatters you.

00:08:01.220 --> 00:08:02.140
What are you saying?

00:08:02.980 --> 00:08:03.980
Unreasonable.

00:08:05.340 --> 00:08:06.180
Ye Ling.

00:08:06.610 --> 00:08:07.660
I'm unreasonable, am I?

00:08:08.100 --> 00:08:09.050
When I married you,

00:08:09.050 --> 00:08:10.100
was I like this?

00:08:10.177 --> 00:08:12.644
If I'd been like this back then,
would you have married me?

00:08:13.290 --> 00:08:14.340
I'm unreasonable?

00:08:14.340 --> 00:08:15.250
I'll tell you this.

00:08:15.810 --> 00:08:17.140
If anyone again, in front of me,

00:08:17.140 --> 00:08:18.140
speaks ill of Ye Sibei,

00:08:18.140 --> 00:08:19.610
I'll still make a scene.

00:08:19.610 --> 00:08:20.490
What's the big deal?

00:08:20.490 --> 00:08:22.050
I don't care about saving face anymore.

00:08:22.050 --> 00:08:23.340
What do I care about?

00:08:23.340 --> 00:08:23.730
No.

00:08:23.730 --> 00:08:25.580
There are many people
saying such things.

00:08:25.580 --> 00:08:26.688
You can't go after each one

00:08:26.733 --> 00:08:27.977
and argue with them, can you?

00:08:28.140 --> 00:08:28.490
Look,

00:08:28.490 --> 00:08:29.777
because you argued today,

00:08:29.844 --> 00:08:30.940
you lost five hundred yuan.

00:08:32.940 --> 00:08:34.890
That's what you'd say as her father.

00:08:35.220 --> 00:08:35.890
Do you know

00:08:35.890 --> 00:08:37.460
how they spoke about Ye Sibei?

00:08:37.460 --> 00:08:39.650
Do you know how awful those words were?

00:08:39.650 --> 00:08:40.940
Sibei is a victim.

00:08:40.940 --> 00:08:42.340
She was forced!

00:08:42.340 --> 00:08:44.100
Do you know how scared she was then?

00:08:44.100 --> 00:08:45.580
Who cared?

00:08:45.580 --> 00:08:47.340
How can you be the same as them?

00:08:47.644 --> 00:08:48.466
I ask you!

00:08:48.488 --> 00:08:50.100
Back then,
you were full of righteous anger.

00:08:50.100 --> 00:08:51.220
You wanted to call the police.

00:08:51.220 --> 00:08:53.220
Now Fan Jiancheng is
swaggering around again.

00:08:53.220 --> 00:08:54.610
What have you done?

00:08:54.610 --> 00:08:57.100
You just cower at home!

00:08:57.650 --> 00:08:59.220
You good for nothing.

00:08:59.490 --> 00:09:00.340
What can I do?

00:09:00.733 --> 00:09:02.220
I could take a knife and kill him?

00:09:02.888 --> 00:09:04.080
If I'd known it'd come to this,

00:09:04.080 --> 00:09:06.511
I might have taken the money
and settled it privately back then.

00:09:07.610 --> 00:09:08.490
Ye Ling.

00:09:08.490 --> 00:09:09.130
Get out.

00:09:09.130 --> 00:09:09.820
Wait, Mom.

00:09:09.820 --> 00:09:10.650
Mom!

00:09:10.650 --> 00:09:12.820
I really can't stand you anymore!

00:09:12.820 --> 00:09:14.610
- What have you done for this family?
- I...

00:09:14.610 --> 00:09:15.980
What have you ever done?

00:09:15.980 --> 00:09:17.130
I was just agreeing with you!

00:09:17.130 --> 00:09:18.220
Answer me!

00:09:18.220 --> 00:09:19.610
Ye Ling, I'm asking you!

00:09:19.610 --> 00:09:20.460
Ye Sibei's

00:09:20.460 --> 00:09:21.370
innocence and dignity...

00:09:21.370 --> 00:09:23.220
How much are they worth?
Name your price!

00:09:23.220 --> 00:09:24.490
Alright.

00:09:25.010 --> 00:09:25.850
I was wrong.

00:09:27.700 --> 00:09:28.370
Mom.

00:09:28.490 --> 00:09:29.490
Let's not argue with him.

00:09:40.890 --> 00:09:42.010
Dad.

00:09:42.010 --> 00:09:43.490
How could you say something like that?

00:09:43.490 --> 00:09:44.330
You...

00:09:45.066 --> 00:09:47.220
I just spoke without thinking,
and followed her words.

00:09:48.300 --> 00:09:49.250
I was wrong.

00:09:52.620 --> 00:09:54.500
(Jinyan Law Firm)

00:09:54.530 --> 00:09:55.370
It's him.

00:09:56.700 --> 00:09:57.540
Alright.

00:09:57.940 --> 00:09:58.780
I understand.

00:10:11.300 --> 00:10:12.130
Nianwen.

00:10:12.250 --> 00:10:13.130
Stop waiting.

00:10:13.200 --> 00:10:14.733
Lawyer Meng is away on a business trip.

00:10:14.755 --> 00:10:15.911
He won't be back for now.

00:10:39.610 --> 00:10:40.450
Nianwen!

00:10:47.980 --> 00:10:48.700
Meng Xin!

00:10:48.700 --> 00:10:49.420
Open the door!

00:10:49.420 --> 00:10:50.530
I just saw you!

00:10:51.490 --> 00:10:52.610
You're hiding on purpose.

00:10:52.610 --> 00:10:53.730
Feeling guilty, aren't you?

00:10:53.730 --> 00:10:55.010
Open the door! Open it!

00:10:55.010 --> 00:10:55.850
Nianwen!

00:10:56.730 --> 00:10:58.130
Stop coming here to make a scene!

00:10:58.130 --> 00:10:59.300
As for your sister's case,

00:10:59.300 --> 00:11:02.010
there's nothing new
we can work out by talking here.

00:11:02.010 --> 00:11:03.650
Since you chose to file a lawsuit,

00:11:03.650 --> 00:11:05.300
you must be ready to face the outcome!

00:11:06.300 --> 00:11:07.650
Then tell me,

00:11:07.650 --> 00:11:08.730
how did Fan Jiancheng get

00:11:08.730 --> 00:11:10.390
that photo of my sister
with her eyes open?

00:11:11.820 --> 00:11:13.580
Say something!

00:11:13.580 --> 00:11:15.060
Open the door!

00:11:15.060 --> 00:11:15.900
Open up!

00:11:16.730 --> 00:11:18.100
Nianwen!

00:11:18.100 --> 00:11:19.890
Did you take
the judicial exam for nothing?

00:11:19.890 --> 00:11:21.890
Defense lawyers,
in the course of their practice,

00:11:21.890 --> 00:11:24.420
have the right to keep their clients'

00:11:24.420 --> 00:11:25.940
information confidential!

00:11:25.940 --> 00:11:27.220
We are lawyers!

00:11:27.220 --> 00:11:29.010
We must be loyal to our clients!

00:11:29.010 --> 00:11:30.250
That's the iron rule!

00:11:30.250 --> 00:11:31.490
Is that how you interpret it?

00:11:32.130 --> 00:11:34.130
There's nothing wrong
with loyalty to a client,

00:11:34.130 --> 00:11:36.010
but your client is a rapist!

00:11:36.010 --> 00:11:37.820
He should be punished as he deserves,

00:11:37.820 --> 00:11:39.420
not helped to forge evidence!

00:11:39.420 --> 00:11:40.300
You're aiding evil!

00:11:40.730 --> 00:11:42.100
Do you even deserve to be a lawyer?

00:11:42.100 --> 00:11:42.977
Do you?

00:11:42.977 --> 00:11:44.644
- Do you deserve to be a lawyer?
- Nianwen!

00:11:44.666 --> 00:11:45.440
Let go of me!

00:11:45.444 --> 00:11:46.530
Tell me!

00:11:46.530 --> 00:11:47.650
- Tell me!
- Let go!

00:11:47.650 --> 00:11:49.820
How can you call yourself a lawyer?

00:11:51.010 --> 00:11:51.850
Get out.

00:11:52.010 --> 00:11:52.850
Enough!

00:11:53.130 --> 00:11:54.730
Let go!

00:11:54.730 --> 00:11:56.100
What are you two doing?

00:11:57.650 --> 00:11:58.530
Nianwen.

00:12:00.730 --> 00:12:02.100
Mr. Qin, you came just in time.

00:12:02.650 --> 00:12:04.100
Please take Nianwen home.

00:12:04.820 --> 00:12:06.420
He laid hands on me today.

00:12:06.420 --> 00:12:07.730
If he comes again,

00:12:08.300 --> 00:12:09.220
I'll call the police.

00:12:10.820 --> 00:12:13.200
Nianwen. We've worked together
as mentor and student.

00:12:13.244 --> 00:12:15.088
I'll give you one last piece of advice.

00:12:15.370 --> 00:12:17.250
Coming here to vent your anger

00:12:17.250 --> 00:12:18.530
won't help you at all.

00:12:18.530 --> 00:12:20.010
What you should do now

00:12:20.010 --> 00:12:22.220
is go home and comfort your family.

00:12:22.610 --> 00:12:24.730
If you believe the verdict is wrong,

00:12:24.730 --> 00:12:26.530
use your training
to appeal for your sister.

00:12:26.530 --> 00:12:27.940
Coming here to shout at me

00:12:27.940 --> 00:12:29.420
only shows you've lost your head!

00:12:37.220 --> 00:12:38.100
Let's go.

00:12:40.820 --> 00:12:41.890
Come on.

00:12:41.890 --> 00:12:42.730
It's over. Go.

00:13:08.300 --> 00:13:09.140
Nianwen.

00:13:10.730 --> 00:13:12.650
You really can't
keep going on like this.

00:13:13.800 --> 00:13:16.133
Do you know
how worried your parents are?

00:13:28.650 --> 00:13:30.610
Give it back!

00:13:40.820 --> 00:13:42.130
Nan.

00:13:43.340 --> 00:13:45.340
I can't help it, you know?

00:13:46.730 --> 00:13:47.890
I...

00:13:47.890 --> 00:13:49.340
I could only go to Meng Xin.

00:13:49.340 --> 00:13:51.700
I really had no other choice.

00:13:51.700 --> 00:13:53.610
I just hoped that maybe

00:13:53.610 --> 00:13:56.250
he'd feel a bit of pity for me.

00:13:56.980 --> 00:13:58.980
Even just give me a small hint.

00:13:59.460 --> 00:14:02.610
But there's no hope at all.

00:14:03.890 --> 00:14:05.488
Nothing left.

00:14:07.130 --> 00:14:07.970
I know.

00:14:09.580 --> 00:14:11.490
I failed my sister.

00:14:12.130 --> 00:14:15.370
When she wanted to call the police,
I stopped her...

00:14:18.850 --> 00:14:21.130
Why did I stop her?

00:14:23.130 --> 00:14:23.970
I really...

00:14:24.180 --> 00:14:25.130
Nianwen!

00:14:25.700 --> 00:14:26.540
Nianwen!

00:14:27.250 --> 00:14:28.090
Enough, Nianwen!

00:14:48.610 --> 00:14:49.980
I know you're in pain.

00:14:51.610 --> 00:14:52.890
We all are.

00:14:56.180 --> 00:14:58.130
But life has to go on.

00:15:11.130 --> 00:15:12.250
Mom and Dad are getting old.

00:15:13.044 --> 00:15:14.140
Their health's not good.

00:15:16.180 --> 00:15:18.180
If we both fall apart now,

00:15:18.180 --> 00:15:19.300
who will they rely on?

00:15:23.490 --> 00:15:25.300
Just do me this favor.

00:15:26.010 --> 00:15:27.460
I'll look after your sister.

00:15:28.610 --> 00:15:30.130
You take care of Mom and Dad.

00:15:31.340 --> 00:15:33.490
Together, we'll hold this family up.

00:15:41.010 --> 00:15:41.850
Don't worry.

00:15:42.460 --> 00:15:43.610
This isn't over.

00:15:44.730 --> 00:15:46.850
We'll get justice in the end.

00:15:47.490 --> 00:15:49.370
But it'll take time.

00:15:50.088 --> 00:15:51.250
It might be a long while

00:15:51.250 --> 00:15:52.890
before we get the answers we want.

00:15:55.060 --> 00:15:56.010
That's why we must

00:15:56.010 --> 00:15:57.730
stand up like grown men,

00:15:58.700 --> 00:16:00.250
protect our family,

00:16:00.730 --> 00:16:02.490
and protect those we care about.

00:16:04.060 --> 00:16:05.730
We have to keep living.

00:16:31.420 --> 00:16:33.140
(Labor Termination Notice)
Ming.

00:16:33.300 --> 00:16:34.370
What's the meaning of this?

00:16:36.300 --> 00:16:37.890
We're not that intimate.

00:16:37.890 --> 00:16:39.020
I don't deserve it.

00:16:39.460 --> 00:16:40.300
Fine.

00:16:41.130 --> 00:16:42.340
Then I'll call you Mr. Zhao.

00:16:43.610 --> 00:16:44.530
Mr. Zhao.

00:16:44.980 --> 00:16:46.610
I've worked at Fuqiang for years.

00:16:46.610 --> 00:16:48.770
Maybe no great achievements,
but plenty of hard work.

00:16:48.850 --> 00:16:50.010
Don't tell me you've forgotten

00:16:50.010 --> 00:16:51.533
how you made all that money.

00:16:51.730 --> 00:16:53.340
You want to use me and then cut me off,

00:16:54.010 --> 00:16:55.730
at least give me an explanation!

00:16:56.377 --> 00:16:57.733
Doing it on purpose, are you?

00:16:58.000 --> 00:16:59.088
Afraid people can't hear?

00:16:59.088 --> 00:16:59.980
That's right!

00:16:59.980 --> 00:17:01.890
I just want everyone to see

00:17:01.890 --> 00:17:04.490
how you, Mr Zhao,
use people and then ditch them!

00:17:04.490 --> 00:17:05.900
How you threw out

00:17:05.900 --> 00:17:08.010
the man who helped you
start this business

00:17:08.010 --> 00:17:09.330
like he was nothing!

00:17:10.290 --> 00:17:11.490
Do you even realize

00:17:12.380 --> 00:17:14.380
how much your dirty mess
costs the company?

00:17:14.380 --> 00:17:15.290
Don't you?

00:17:16.250 --> 00:17:17.380
I've helped you

00:17:17.380 --> 00:17:18.700
when I should,

00:17:18.700 --> 00:17:19.860
and when I shouldn't.

00:17:19.860 --> 00:17:22.010
Now the shareholders
are furious with me.

00:17:22.010 --> 00:17:23.390
I can't help you this time.

00:17:23.890 --> 00:17:26.250
Don't talk to me about shareholders.

00:17:26.250 --> 00:17:28.490
You've really
lost your mind, haven't you?

00:17:28.490 --> 00:17:29.700
Forgot everything?

00:17:30.570 --> 00:17:33.620
Who helped you grab
your first plot of land?

00:17:33.620 --> 00:17:36.570
Who built your first building for you?

00:17:36.570 --> 00:17:38.140
If it weren't for me, Fan Jiancheng,

00:17:38.140 --> 00:17:39.010
your shareholders

00:17:40.010 --> 00:17:41.620
would be left with nothing to eat!

00:17:44.730 --> 00:17:45.570
Jiancheng,

00:17:46.900 --> 00:17:48.140
you're stuck in a pit.

00:17:48.700 --> 00:17:50.140
Stop struggling.

00:17:50.140 --> 00:17:51.490
Someone gave you a hand,

00:17:51.490 --> 00:17:53.250
and you just
took the chance to climb out.

00:17:53.250 --> 00:17:54.460
If you take the money and go,

00:17:54.460 --> 00:17:55.466
we're still relatives.

00:17:55.860 --> 00:17:57.460
Now you remember we're relatives.

00:17:58.010 --> 00:17:59.180
My wife calls you brother.

00:17:59.700 --> 00:18:01.290
My daughter calls you uncle.

00:18:02.730 --> 00:18:04.860
Let me tell you something, Zhao Ming.

00:18:04.860 --> 00:18:06.490
Ten percent of the shares,

00:18:06.490 --> 00:18:08.050
three million in compensation,

00:18:08.050 --> 00:18:09.180
one penny less,

00:18:09.180 --> 00:18:11.730
and I'll expose
every filthy thing you've done.

00:18:12.490 --> 00:18:13.330
Come on.

00:18:16.330 --> 00:18:17.860
You know

00:18:18.730 --> 00:18:19.980
who's backing me.

00:18:21.330 --> 00:18:23.250
You know what your

00:18:23.250 --> 00:18:24.460
reputation is now?

00:18:26.490 --> 00:18:27.980
You really do scare me.

00:18:29.140 --> 00:18:30.860
Listen, Zhao Ming.

00:18:30.860 --> 00:18:32.620
When I call you Mr. Zhao,

00:18:32.620 --> 00:18:33.900
you're a boss.

00:18:35.050 --> 00:18:36.290
When I don't,

00:18:36.290 --> 00:18:37.860
you're nothing but rubbish!

00:18:37.860 --> 00:18:38.700
Pah!

00:18:48.290 --> 00:18:50.050
I've got far more class than you.

00:19:08.460 --> 00:19:11.100
(Labor Termination Notice)

00:19:22.730 --> 00:19:23.570
Mr. Fan.

00:19:25.460 --> 00:19:27.140
Did you finish the task I gave you?

00:19:28.620 --> 00:19:29.460
Alright.

00:19:30.066 --> 00:19:31.555
Help her sit down and rest for a bit.

00:19:31.730 --> 00:19:33.250
With your drinking capacity, Mr. Zheng,

00:19:33.250 --> 00:19:35.490
how could they possibly outdrink you?

00:19:35.490 --> 00:19:36.777
Xiaoyang, come on.

00:19:36.800 --> 00:19:37.980
Mr. Zhao's been waiting for you.

00:19:37.980 --> 00:19:39.490
Where did you two disappear to?

00:19:39.490 --> 00:19:41.330
I just went to the toilet.

00:19:42.290 --> 00:19:45.250
Mr. Zheng, look,
our table is round tonight,

00:19:45.250 --> 00:19:46.290
and our glasses are full.

00:19:48.010 --> 00:19:49.140
Thank you.

00:19:49.140 --> 00:19:50.620
Thank you, ladies.

00:19:50.620 --> 00:19:52.490
No more for me. Don't pour.

00:19:52.490 --> 00:19:54.050
Three more glasses.

00:19:54.050 --> 00:19:55.050
I'll take the penalty.

00:19:55.050 --> 00:19:55.980
Penalty...

00:19:56.333 --> 00:19:58.050
Alright then, Mr. Zheng, I'll drink.

00:19:58.333 --> 00:19:59.311
I accept the penalty.

00:19:59.490 --> 00:20:00.330
Mr. Zheng...

00:20:04.980 --> 00:20:06.490
Come on. More liquor.

00:20:11.860 --> 00:20:12.700
Waiter.

00:20:13.980 --> 00:20:14.820
Yes, sir?

00:20:15.330 --> 00:20:16.180
Please

00:20:17.140 --> 00:20:18.220
take this glass of water

00:20:18.220 --> 00:20:20.730
to my colleague over there.
She's had a bit too much to drink.

00:20:20.730 --> 00:20:22.460
She's the one wearing the coat.

00:20:22.911 --> 00:20:24.090
It'll help her sober up.

00:20:24.250 --> 00:20:24.930
Of course.

00:20:25.050 --> 00:20:25.900
Thank you.

00:20:27.460 --> 00:20:28.300
Have some water.

00:20:32.900 --> 00:20:33.740
Tao Jie.

00:20:33.900 --> 00:20:34.740
Mr. Fan.

00:20:36.570 --> 00:20:38.330
I just finished signing these documents.

00:20:38.570 --> 00:20:39.460
They're very important.

00:20:40.140 --> 00:20:41.140
Handle them quickly.

00:20:51.980 --> 00:20:54.060
(Room 208. Wu Meili)

00:20:59.290 --> 00:21:00.860
All done. Don't worry.

00:21:25.290 --> 00:21:26.290
Feeling any better?

00:21:28.460 --> 00:21:31.010
I brought
your favorite steamed apples.

00:21:31.010 --> 00:21:32.980
See if it still tastes like
when you were little.

00:21:36.620 --> 00:21:38.730
You used to love
steamed apples as a child.

00:21:40.140 --> 00:21:41.900
You lost
your baby teeth later than most.

00:21:42.620 --> 00:21:44.250
Once, when you were eating an apple,

00:21:44.250 --> 00:21:45.490
you suddenly called me.

00:21:45.490 --> 00:21:46.620
You were crying.

00:21:46.620 --> 00:21:47.490
"Mom.

00:21:47.490 --> 00:21:48.570
The apple's grown a tooth."

00:21:49.490 --> 00:21:50.330
I looked,

00:21:50.330 --> 00:21:52.180
and your tooth

00:21:52.180 --> 00:21:53.490
was stuck in the apple.

00:21:56.730 --> 00:21:59.490
Then you still insisted,
"I want to eat it."

00:21:59.490 --> 00:22:00.700
So I steamed one for you.

00:22:01.980 --> 00:22:03.250
And you told me,

00:22:05.330 --> 00:22:07.250
it was the best apple you'd ever eaten.

00:22:09.660 --> 00:22:11.460
Back then, life was hard.

00:22:13.180 --> 00:22:14.700
You only got one when you were ill.

00:22:15.330 --> 00:22:17.290
Later, things got better as you grew up.

00:22:19.250 --> 00:22:20.380
And I forgot...

00:22:22.290 --> 00:22:23.180
Sibei.

00:22:25.250 --> 00:22:26.940
You've always been a good daughter.

00:22:28.860 --> 00:22:30.460
No matter how hard I've been on you,

00:22:30.460 --> 00:22:31.810
whatever I asked you to do,

00:22:31.810 --> 00:22:33.290
you'd say you didn't want to,

00:22:34.290 --> 00:22:36.420
but you'd still do it for me.

00:22:36.420 --> 00:22:38.930
From now on,
I won't ask you to do anything.

00:22:39.890 --> 00:22:41.660
Do whatever you want.

00:22:42.700 --> 00:22:43.730
I support you.

00:22:45.380 --> 00:22:46.860
Sibei, have a bite.

00:22:48.010 --> 00:22:49.490
See if it still tastes the same.

00:22:50.250 --> 00:22:51.090
Just one bite.

00:22:54.570 --> 00:22:55.660
Come on.

00:22:56.250 --> 00:22:57.940
Isn't it the same as before?

00:23:03.420 --> 00:23:04.700
Have a bite.

00:23:18.810 --> 00:23:20.530
I won't force you anymore.

00:23:20.530 --> 00:23:21.940
If you don't want it, that's fine.

00:23:32.380 --> 00:23:34.010
I'll come see you another day.

00:23:38.090 --> 00:23:38.940
Mom.

00:23:39.380 --> 00:23:40.250
Did she eat?

00:23:53.730 --> 00:23:54.570
Qin Nan.

00:23:55.730 --> 00:23:57.180
I've got an idea for you.

00:23:58.250 --> 00:23:59.530
When Sibei

00:23:59.530 --> 00:24:00.490
gets a bit better,

00:24:01.050 --> 00:24:01.900
why don't you two

00:24:02.420 --> 00:24:03.700
move somewhere else for a while?

00:24:04.570 --> 00:24:05.410
Mom.

00:24:06.010 --> 00:24:07.460
You know what Sibei's like.

00:24:08.290 --> 00:24:09.460
She won't just walk away.

00:24:10.090 --> 00:24:11.490
If she did that,

00:24:11.490 --> 00:24:13.250
she'd feel like she was running away.

00:24:14.290 --> 00:24:16.460
Then everything she's fought for

00:24:16.460 --> 00:24:17.460
would be for nothing.

00:24:23.730 --> 00:24:26.220
See later if she can eat a little.

00:24:26.570 --> 00:24:27.980
If not, you eat it.

00:24:27.980 --> 00:24:29.290
It can't sit too long.

00:24:29.290 --> 00:24:30.220
I'm heading off.

00:24:31.311 --> 00:24:32.355
Mom, let me walk you out.

00:24:32.377 --> 00:24:33.250
No need.

00:24:48.570 --> 00:24:49.700
Ms. Jin.

00:24:49.700 --> 00:24:50.460
Have some tea.

00:24:50.460 --> 00:24:51.300
Thank you.

00:24:52.460 --> 00:24:53.350
Ms. Jin,

00:24:53.580 --> 00:24:54.700
did you come today

00:24:54.700 --> 00:24:55.844
because something happened

00:24:55.844 --> 00:24:57.140
to Wenwen at school?

00:24:57.570 --> 00:24:58.530
Ms. Zhao,

00:24:58.530 --> 00:24:59.700
here's the situation.

00:24:59.700 --> 00:25:00.980
Wenwen used to be

00:25:00.980 --> 00:25:02.700
a very lively and cheerful child.

00:25:03.100 --> 00:25:04.890
But lately,

00:25:05.140 --> 00:25:07.210
she's been sitting alone in class.

00:25:07.540 --> 00:25:09.980
She doesn't go out
to play during breaks.

00:25:09.980 --> 00:25:10.860
Sometimes,

00:25:10.860 --> 00:25:12.980
she doesn't speak all day.

00:25:12.980 --> 00:25:14.100
Other teachers

00:25:14.100 --> 00:25:15.340
have also told me

00:25:15.340 --> 00:25:17.140
that she often zones out in class,

00:25:17.140 --> 00:25:18.460
lost in thought.

00:25:18.560 --> 00:25:20.280
They're not sure
what she's thinking about.

00:25:21.020 --> 00:25:21.740
Oh, right.

00:25:21.740 --> 00:25:24.780
This is the drawing Wenwen made
during a psychology session.

00:25:24.780 --> 00:25:26.140
Please take a look.

00:25:26.140 --> 00:25:27.780
This is her drawing?

00:25:27.780 --> 00:25:29.140
The counselor asked the children

00:25:29.140 --> 00:25:30.980
to draw something

00:25:30.980 --> 00:25:33.460
that best shows how they feel inside.

00:25:33.460 --> 00:25:35.740
Some drew birds in the sky,

00:25:35.740 --> 00:25:37.740
some drew sunflowers,

00:25:37.740 --> 00:25:39.980
and others drew their parents.

00:25:39.980 --> 00:25:41.980
But Wenwen's picture

00:25:41.980 --> 00:25:44.460
really surprised the teachers.

00:25:44.460 --> 00:25:45.300
Combined with

00:25:45.300 --> 00:25:46.740
her recent behavior,

00:25:46.740 --> 00:25:47.740
which is very unusual,

00:25:48.140 --> 00:25:50.420
the psychology teacher

00:25:50.420 --> 00:25:52.140
asked me to keep an eye on her.

00:25:53.860 --> 00:25:55.180
Ms. Jin, I understand.

00:25:55.860 --> 00:25:56.980
Sorry to trouble you

00:25:56.980 --> 00:25:58.220
for coming all the way here.

00:26:19.511 --> 00:26:20.259
(This rice here)

00:26:20.260 --> 00:26:21.820
(is the one many of you
kept asking about)

00:26:21.820 --> 00:26:23.420
(in the comments under my video.)

00:26:23.420 --> 00:26:25.100
(It's fifty-one yuan a bag
on the official website.)

00:26:25.100 --> 00:26:25.940
(But today, I won't even charge)

00:26:25.940 --> 00:26:27.500
(fifty-one for two bags. Here we go!)

00:26:27.640 --> 00:26:29.220
(Thirty-nine ninety! Add to cart!)

00:26:29.220 --> 00:26:30.180
(Two bags, everyone.)

00:26:30.180 --> 00:26:31.820
(Two bags! Remember! Two bags!)

00:26:31.820 --> 00:26:33.600
(The link's live.
Hurry and place your orders.)

00:26:33.620 --> 00:26:35.400
(Not much stock left.
We're out of stock already.)

00:26:35.400 --> 00:26:37.220
(How come some
of you say you missed it?)

00:26:37.220 --> 00:26:38.100
(One thousand orders gone.)

00:26:38.100 --> 00:26:39.140
(- Yes.)
(- Oh my goodness.)

00:26:39.140 --> 00:26:41.140
(You guys are amazing, really!)

00:26:46.140 --> 00:26:47.140
You've arrived, Madam.

00:26:47.140 --> 00:26:47.980
Alright, thank you.

00:26:47.980 --> 00:26:49.980
If you don't mind,
could you leave me a good review?

00:26:49.980 --> 00:26:50.840
Sure, no problem.

00:26:50.840 --> 00:26:51.940
- Of course.
- Thanks.

00:26:51.940 --> 00:26:52.540
No worries.

00:26:52.540 --> 00:26:53.380
Take care.

00:26:58.740 --> 00:26:59.620
(Order Completed)

00:27:19.180 --> 00:27:21.540
(The court has cleared my name!)

00:27:21.540 --> 00:27:23.380
Yes, I am innocent!

00:27:23.380 --> 00:27:24.980
(I am not guilty!)

00:27:24.980 --> 00:27:26.380
(Ye Sibei's family beat someone up!)

00:27:40.580 --> 00:27:42.180
Where's Wenwen's parent?

00:27:42.180 --> 00:27:43.780
Dad.

00:28:03.380 --> 00:28:04.220
Captain Zhang.

00:28:05.900 --> 00:28:06.740
Captain Zhang.

00:28:07.133 --> 00:28:07.930
What a coincidence.

00:28:07.930 --> 00:28:08.740
It really is you.

00:28:09.180 --> 00:28:10.180
What are you doing here?

00:28:10.320 --> 00:28:11.177
Waiting for someone?

00:28:11.180 --> 00:28:12.222
Me?

00:28:12.380 --> 00:28:12.900
No.

00:28:12.900 --> 00:28:14.740
I just dropped off a passenger.

00:28:15.620 --> 00:28:16.700
A passenger?

00:28:17.380 --> 00:28:17.980
Yes.

00:28:17.980 --> 00:28:19.380
I'm driving

00:28:19.400 --> 00:28:20.577
for a ride-hailing app now.

00:28:20.800 --> 00:28:21.711
Really?

00:28:21.866 --> 00:28:23.200
Captain Zhang, where are you heading?

00:28:23.200 --> 00:28:24.066
I can give you a lift.

00:28:25.100 --> 00:28:25.700
Alright.

00:28:25.700 --> 00:28:26.580
Well then...

00:28:26.580 --> 00:28:27.420
How...

00:28:27.420 --> 00:28:28.644
How do I place the order?

00:28:29.300 --> 00:28:30.180
No need to book.

00:28:30.700 --> 00:28:32.420
Just hop in.

00:28:32.420 --> 00:28:33.180
Is that proper?

00:28:33.180 --> 00:28:34.644
What's improper about it? Come on.

00:28:34.700 --> 00:28:35.180
Alright.

00:28:35.180 --> 00:28:36.690
I'm not holding back with you anymore.

00:28:54.940 --> 00:28:55.860
Nianwen.

00:28:56.380 --> 00:28:58.140
Do you really like driving?

00:28:59.180 --> 00:29:00.020
I...

00:29:00.955 --> 00:29:02.511
You were doing well as a lawyer.

00:29:02.511 --> 00:29:03.644
Why did you quit?

00:29:03.860 --> 00:29:05.933
What made you
suddenly decide to drive instead?

00:29:05.940 --> 00:29:07.180
No particular reason.

00:29:07.180 --> 00:29:08.620
I just think I'm

00:29:09.700 --> 00:29:10.900
not that clever,

00:29:10.900 --> 00:29:11.860
not good with words.

00:29:12.500 --> 00:29:13.540
Not cut out to be a lawyer.

00:29:14.620 --> 00:29:15.540
Maybe

00:29:15.650 --> 00:29:16.940
I chose the wrong career.

00:29:18.980 --> 00:29:20.020
Nianwen.

00:29:20.020 --> 00:29:21.300
Don't be so pessimistic.

00:29:22.311 --> 00:29:25.044
You can't just stop walking
because you sprained your ankle.

00:29:26.444 --> 00:29:27.911
Evil never triumphs over good.

00:29:28.180 --> 00:29:29.100
After all,

00:29:29.540 --> 00:29:30.700
the truth

00:29:30.700 --> 00:29:32.140
will always come to light.

00:29:35.260 --> 00:29:36.100
Captain Zhang,

00:29:37.460 --> 00:29:39.022
will you keep investigating?

00:29:41.660 --> 00:29:42.500
Watch the road.

00:29:42.820 --> 00:29:43.780
Captain Zhang,

00:29:43.780 --> 00:29:45.180
the last time I saw Chuchu,

00:29:45.180 --> 00:29:46.020
I got a lead.

00:29:46.460 --> 00:29:48.420
That night, she did get
a message from my sister

00:29:48.420 --> 00:29:49.733
saying she'd gotten home safely.

00:29:49.755 --> 00:29:51.260
But when we checked my sister's phone,

00:29:51.260 --> 00:29:52.300
there was no record of it.

00:29:52.300 --> 00:29:53.380
So I believe

00:29:53.380 --> 00:29:55.060
Fan Jiancheng used my sister's phone

00:29:55.060 --> 00:29:56.700
to send that message to Chuchu.

00:29:56.700 --> 00:29:57.620
Then he deleted it.

00:29:57.620 --> 00:29:59.060
Clearly out of guilt.

00:29:59.500 --> 00:30:00.060
He just wanted

00:30:00.060 --> 00:30:02.540
to stop Chuchu
from asking about my sister that night.

00:30:02.540 --> 00:30:04.620
But deleting the message

00:30:04.620 --> 00:30:05.820
made him look even guiltier.

00:30:06.300 --> 00:30:07.100
So...

00:30:07.100 --> 00:30:08.500
So we can follow this lead further...

00:30:08.500 --> 00:30:09.340
Nianwen.

00:30:11.460 --> 00:30:13.980
I have to tell you this seriously.

00:30:13.980 --> 00:30:15.540
We police handle the cases.

00:30:16.380 --> 00:30:17.980
Don't do what you shouldn't do.

00:30:19.020 --> 00:30:20.540
If you want to keep driving,

00:30:20.540 --> 00:30:21.620
I won't stop you.

00:30:22.060 --> 00:30:23.540
But let me give you some advice.

00:30:24.780 --> 00:30:26.260
Don't let one incident

00:30:27.300 --> 00:30:29.020
make you abandon your career

00:30:29.620 --> 00:30:31.300
and change your whole path.

00:30:32.220 --> 00:30:33.420
Your life

00:30:33.420 --> 00:30:34.500
belongs to you.

00:30:37.220 --> 00:30:38.380
Live it well.

00:30:57.640 --> 00:30:58.500
If it were you...

00:30:58.500 --> 00:30:59.460
Master.

00:30:59.460 --> 00:31:00.300
What would you do?

00:31:02.220 --> 00:31:03.700
Master, you're finally here.

00:31:06.660 --> 00:31:07.660
Have a look.

00:31:07.660 --> 00:31:10.660
This is Fan Jiancheng's
activity record for the past month.

00:31:10.660 --> 00:31:12.220
Nothing unusual.

00:31:12.220 --> 00:31:14.500
See if I've missed anything.

00:31:16.700 --> 00:31:17.660
Eat. Eat while I read.

00:31:28.620 --> 00:31:29.460
How?

00:31:30.500 --> 00:31:31.460
Looks fine.

00:31:32.500 --> 00:31:33.620
No problem?

00:31:35.660 --> 00:31:37.020
Then what do we do about the case?

00:31:37.980 --> 00:31:39.780
For now, there's nothing we can do.

00:31:41.460 --> 00:31:42.300
How...

00:31:43.020 --> 00:31:44.260
How can that be?

00:31:45.022 --> 00:31:46.980
You forgot what you said before?

00:31:47.460 --> 00:31:49.866
You said this case wasn't over.

00:31:55.060 --> 00:31:55.900
Yes.

00:31:56.460 --> 00:31:57.420
But right now,

00:31:58.222 --> 00:32:00.480
it's been less than a month
since the first trial ended.

00:32:00.820 --> 00:32:01.980
Think about it.

00:32:01.980 --> 00:32:03.820
He'll definitely
be keeping his head down now.

00:32:03.820 --> 00:32:05.180
Even if you keep digging,

00:32:06.100 --> 00:32:07.180
you won't find anything.

00:32:18.100 --> 00:32:19.260
Enough.

00:32:23.460 --> 00:32:24.300
So

00:32:25.940 --> 00:32:26.980
the direction's wrong.

00:32:28.660 --> 00:32:29.500
What do you mean?

00:32:30.540 --> 00:32:32.260
What we should be looking into now

00:32:33.100 --> 00:32:33.980
isn't Fan Jiancheng.

00:32:37.980 --> 00:32:39.180
Why did Zhao Shuhui

00:32:39.180 --> 00:32:40.977
suddenly produce that piece of evidence?

00:32:41.266 --> 00:32:42.620
Can you make sense of that?

00:32:45.820 --> 00:32:46.940
That day,

00:32:47.380 --> 00:32:48.500
at the court,

00:32:49.500 --> 00:32:51.380
Fan Jiancheng was released on the spot.

00:32:52.020 --> 00:32:54.260
And Zhao Shuhui's reaction was odd.

00:32:54.700 --> 00:32:56.820
She didn't look happy at all.

00:32:57.066 --> 00:32:58.020
That's not how someone

00:32:58.020 --> 00:32:59.900
who truly believes
her husband is innocent

00:32:59.900 --> 00:33:00.820
would react.

00:33:02.980 --> 00:33:04.260
But actually,

00:33:05.020 --> 00:33:06.780
what confuses me most is

00:33:08.460 --> 00:33:12.060
that Ye Sibei believed she was assaulted

00:33:12.060 --> 00:33:13.460
because she'd drunk too much

00:33:13.460 --> 00:33:14.460
and blacked out.

00:33:15.460 --> 00:33:17.980
But everyone there
said she didn't drink much.

00:33:18.940 --> 00:33:20.220
And

00:33:20.220 --> 00:33:21.620
that photo of her

00:33:21.620 --> 00:33:24.020
with her eyes open but no memory of it

00:33:24.020 --> 00:33:25.180
proves the inconsistency.

00:33:27.700 --> 00:33:28.540
Yes.

00:33:31.780 --> 00:33:33.260
But why?

00:33:36.500 --> 00:33:37.340
Boss.

00:33:37.940 --> 00:33:38.940
The drinks!

00:33:38.940 --> 00:33:41.020
How many times have I told you,
no more drinking?

00:33:41.020 --> 00:33:42.100
Let's drink another day.

00:33:42.100 --> 00:33:43.780
Sit down.

00:33:43.780 --> 00:33:45.260
- What?
- You've had enough.

00:33:45.260 --> 00:33:46.260
Enough drinking.

00:33:46.260 --> 00:33:47.100
What drink?

00:33:50.540 --> 00:33:51.380
Oh my god.

00:33:52.180 --> 00:33:53.100
Li.

00:33:53.100 --> 00:33:54.260
Quick, mop it up.

00:33:54.260 --> 00:33:54.820
Coming.

00:33:54.820 --> 00:33:55.700
Hurry.

00:33:55.700 --> 00:33:57.020
Sorry...

00:33:57.420 --> 00:33:58.420
You're still drinking?

00:34:01.980 --> 00:34:03.500
Here, have some water.

00:34:03.500 --> 00:34:04.460
Drink some water.

00:34:05.180 --> 00:34:05.900
Here.

00:34:06.020 --> 00:34:06.860
Drink a little first.

00:34:07.300 --> 00:34:08.140
Master.

00:34:09.260 --> 00:34:10.100
Master.

00:34:10.822 --> 00:34:12.700
Why are you
always so curious about trouble?

00:34:14.900 --> 00:34:16.420
Told you to drink less.

00:34:18.060 --> 00:34:19.260
Stop eating.

00:34:19.260 --> 00:34:21.500
Go back and review every statement

00:34:22.644 --> 00:34:23.940
from all involved parties.

00:34:24.022 --> 00:34:25.155
Waiter, the bill, please.

00:34:29.660 --> 00:34:30.460
Table two, right?

00:34:30.460 --> 00:34:31.260
That's 158 yuan.

00:34:41.500 --> 00:34:42.340
Master.

00:34:42.622 --> 00:34:44.700
I've gone through
all the witness and suspect statements

00:34:44.700 --> 00:34:46.780
dozens of times already.

00:34:48.540 --> 00:34:49.380
I really can't find

00:34:49.380 --> 00:34:50.900
anything strange.

00:34:56.460 --> 00:34:58.820
We're not looking for
what's in the statements.

00:34:59.980 --> 00:35:00.820
We're looking for

00:35:02.620 --> 00:35:03.500
what's missing.

00:35:04.540 --> 00:35:05.540
What's missing?

00:35:07.660 --> 00:35:08.500
Water.

00:35:10.380 --> 00:35:12.260
So, guys, what do you
want to hear next?

00:35:12.260 --> 00:35:13.620
I will keep chatting with you.

00:35:19.420 --> 00:35:20.300
This matter...

00:35:21.700 --> 00:35:23.020
It's all in the past.

00:35:23.020 --> 00:35:24.020
Right?

00:35:24.020 --> 00:35:25.666
No need to bring it up again.

00:35:25.866 --> 00:35:28.420
Besides, the court
has already cleared my name.

00:35:29.260 --> 00:35:31.020
As for those malicious rumors,

00:35:31.020 --> 00:35:32.380
I won't pursue them.

00:35:32.380 --> 00:35:33.260
After all,

00:35:33.260 --> 00:35:35.244
everyone deserves a chance
to make things right.

00:35:36.780 --> 00:35:37.540
Alright then,

00:35:37.540 --> 00:35:38.540
time's about up.

00:35:38.540 --> 00:35:40.700
I should get back
and spend time with my wife.

00:35:40.700 --> 00:35:44.020
Everyone, tap a little heart for me.

00:35:44.020 --> 00:35:44.940
Five.

00:35:44.940 --> 00:35:46.020
Four.

00:35:46.020 --> 00:35:46.980
Three.

00:35:46.980 --> 00:35:47.980
Two.

00:35:47.980 --> 00:35:49.020
One.

00:35:49.020 --> 00:35:49.940
Alright.

00:35:49.940 --> 00:35:51.020
Goodbye, everyone.

00:35:51.020 --> 00:35:51.860
See you next time.

00:35:53.780 --> 00:35:54.620
Fan Jiancheng.

00:35:57.444 --> 00:35:59.220
You've got some nerve
doing live streams.

00:36:00.260 --> 00:36:02.620
Are you afraid the whole city
doesn't know who you are?

00:36:03.460 --> 00:36:04.260
Or afraid

00:36:04.260 --> 00:36:05.900
the whole country doesn't?

00:36:07.980 --> 00:36:09.500
What do I have to be afraid of?

00:36:11.300 --> 00:36:13.540
The court already cleared my name.

00:36:13.540 --> 00:36:15.020
I'm innocent.

00:36:15.020 --> 00:36:16.500
You know how scary public opinion

00:36:16.500 --> 00:36:17.700
can be, don't you?

00:36:18.540 --> 00:36:19.780
If you keep this up,

00:36:20.300 --> 00:36:21.540
how will Wenwen face people?

00:36:22.100 --> 00:36:23.460
How will she face her classmates?

00:36:23.820 --> 00:36:25.060
Have you thought about her?

00:36:26.260 --> 00:36:28.660
I am thinking about Wenwen.

00:36:28.660 --> 00:36:30.660
I'm thinking about our family.

00:36:30.660 --> 00:36:32.100
Look,

00:36:32.100 --> 00:36:34.260
your brother cut off
my source of income.

00:36:34.260 --> 00:36:36.620
If I don't make money, how do we live?

00:36:36.620 --> 00:36:37.460
Right?

00:36:38.460 --> 00:36:39.300
Fine.

00:36:39.700 --> 00:36:40.780
You can earn money,

00:36:41.460 --> 00:36:42.300
but

00:36:42.660 --> 00:36:44.220
you must never hurt Wenwen.

00:36:45.260 --> 00:36:46.260
Come on.

00:36:46.260 --> 00:36:47.620
I'm her father.

00:36:48.020 --> 00:36:50.020
How could I hurt her?

00:36:50.020 --> 00:36:50.860
And besides,

00:36:52.180 --> 00:36:53.020
you're my wife,

00:36:53.020 --> 00:36:53.980
and I'm your husband.

00:36:54.460 --> 00:36:56.460
Stop calling me "Fan Jiancheng".

00:36:56.460 --> 00:36:57.820
Call me Jiancheng.

00:36:59.780 --> 00:37:00.780
Alright, fine.

00:37:00.780 --> 00:37:01.420
From now on,

00:37:01.420 --> 00:37:03.700
I won't bring this up again, alright?

00:37:04.260 --> 00:37:05.100
Come on.

00:37:05.540 --> 00:37:06.260
Let's go to bed.

00:37:06.260 --> 00:37:06.660
Okay.

00:37:06.660 --> 00:37:08.080
No need to pull me. I can go myself.

00:38:27.700 --> 00:38:28.540
You're back.

00:38:31.700 --> 00:38:32.780
Why did you get out of bed?

00:38:33.820 --> 00:38:35.020
I feel much better.

00:38:36.900 --> 00:38:38.220
I want to get some fresh air.

00:38:40.133 --> 00:38:41.400
Where do you want to go?

00:38:42.220 --> 00:38:43.700
To my parents' place.

00:38:43.700 --> 00:38:44.980
So they won't worry.

00:38:45.900 --> 00:38:46.740
Alright.

00:39:17.980 --> 00:39:18.540
Qin Nan.

00:39:18.540 --> 00:39:19.659
You don't need to do that.

00:39:19.660 --> 00:39:20.780
- Leave it to us.
- It's fine.

00:39:20.780 --> 00:39:21.980
It's fine, Mom. I'll give you a hand.

00:39:21.980 --> 00:39:23.020
Go. Rest inside.

00:39:23.020 --> 00:39:25.155
Go on, good boy.

00:39:32.100 --> 00:39:32.980
Sibei.

00:39:34.020 --> 00:39:35.220
I want to talk to you.

00:39:38.260 --> 00:39:39.540
I know this matter

00:39:39.540 --> 00:39:41.660
is extremely important to you right now.

00:39:43.260 --> 00:39:44.380
But your life with Qin Nan

00:39:44.380 --> 00:39:45.700
is important too, isn't it?

00:39:46.866 --> 00:39:48.980
You have to think
about your future together.

00:39:51.260 --> 00:39:52.220
Listen to my advice.

00:39:52.800 --> 00:39:54.220
If it doesn't work out, just go.

00:39:54.500 --> 00:39:55.420
Leave this place.

00:39:56.020 --> 00:39:57.180
Go anywhere you like.

00:39:57.700 --> 00:39:58.540
I trust you,

00:39:58.980 --> 00:39:59.900
and I trust Qin Nan.

00:39:59.900 --> 00:40:01.180
Wherever you go, you'll be fine.

00:40:01.700 --> 00:40:02.540
What do you think?

00:40:03.460 --> 00:40:04.500
Mom, why should I leave?

00:40:08.540 --> 00:40:10.500
Why won't you listen to me?

00:40:11.840 --> 00:40:14.260
Think about it,
the rest of your life belongs to you.

00:40:14.260 --> 00:40:15.420
You have to live it well.

00:40:17.180 --> 00:40:17.980
It's all my fault.

00:40:17.980 --> 00:40:19.300
I shouldn't have let you come back.

00:40:19.300 --> 00:40:21.044
Otherwise, none
of this would've happened.

00:40:23.900 --> 00:40:25.020
Sibei.

00:40:25.020 --> 00:40:26.180
Give me a bank card.

00:40:26.780 --> 00:40:27.980
If you ever need money,

00:40:29.020 --> 00:40:30.100
I will find a way.

00:40:30.100 --> 00:40:31.180
Please listen to me.

00:40:31.180 --> 00:40:32.060
Leave this place.

00:40:33.020 --> 00:40:34.020
I'm begging you.

00:40:35.100 --> 00:40:35.940
I can't leave.

00:40:37.780 --> 00:40:38.620
If I go,

00:40:39.620 --> 00:40:41.220
I'll carry this stigma for life.

00:40:43.300 --> 00:40:44.140
But if you stay...

00:40:46.820 --> 00:40:48.940
You'll sacrifice the rest of your life.

00:40:48.940 --> 00:40:50.380
Which is worth it?

00:40:54.580 --> 00:40:56.060
(Hello, fans of Nancheng Stories.)

00:40:56.060 --> 00:40:56.820
(How are you all?)

00:40:56.820 --> 00:40:57.840
(I'm Jie.)

00:40:58.660 --> 00:41:00.140
(Many of you must've been following)

00:41:00.140 --> 00:41:01.555
(the Nancheng sexual assault case.)

00:41:01.860 --> 00:41:02.420
(Especially)

00:41:02.420 --> 00:41:04.620
(after I published my article
on WeChat.)

00:41:04.620 --> 00:41:05.660
(Many of my fans)

00:41:05.660 --> 00:41:07.060
(came to comment)

00:41:07.060 --> 00:41:08.180
(and share your views.)

00:41:10.060 --> 00:41:10.820
(So today,)

00:41:10.820 --> 00:41:12.780
(we've invited the person
involved in the case,)

00:41:12.780 --> 00:41:13.580
(Mr. Fan,)

00:41:13.580 --> 00:41:14.700
(and his lawyer,)

00:41:14.700 --> 00:41:15.700
(Mr. Meng Xin.)

00:41:16.300 --> 00:41:18.540
(They actually invited Fan Jiancheng!)
(Hello everyone, I'm Fan.)

00:41:18.540 --> 00:41:20.844
(He looks like a tough one.)
(One of the people involved in the case.)

00:41:20.866 --> 00:41:22.180
(So that's what
Fan Jiancheng looks like.)

00:41:22.180 --> 00:41:23.020
(Hello, everyone.)

00:41:23.260 --> 00:41:24.820
(Meng Xin is a big-shot lawyer.)
(I'm his lawyer, Meng Xin.)

00:41:25.460 --> 00:41:26.380
(Welcome to you both.)

00:41:26.540 --> 00:41:28.420
(Since this incident happened,)

00:41:28.420 --> 00:41:30.540
(it's stirred up
widespread social discussion.)

00:41:31.340 --> 00:41:32.260
(We've found)

00:41:32.260 --> 00:41:34.540
(that people online
hold very different views)

00:41:34.540 --> 00:41:35.380
(and opinions.)

00:41:35.900 --> 00:41:36.660
(Mr. Meng,)

00:41:36.660 --> 00:41:39.180
(what are your thoughts on this matter?)

00:41:40.860 --> 00:41:42.180
(This isn't simple. There's more to it.)

00:41:42.180 --> 00:41:43.180
(As a lawyer,)

00:41:43.180 --> 00:41:44.820
(Why do people doubt the victim first?)
(I truly dislike seeing)

00:41:44.820 --> 00:41:48.020
(I support Sibei. Hope she stays strong.)
(such issues spiraling endlessly online.)

00:41:48.580 --> 00:41:50.260
(I think, as onlookers,)

00:41:50.260 --> 00:41:53.180
(Fan Jiancheng must have an agenda.)
(we shouldn't insult suspects,)

00:41:53.180 --> 00:41:55.020
(nor should we insult victims.)

00:41:55.020 --> 00:41:56.900
(Victims suffer immense mental stress.)
(We must stay aware of our actions,)

00:41:56.900 --> 00:41:59.060
(to avoid hurting others.)

00:41:59.060 --> 00:42:00.180
(Because of how this has spread,)

00:42:00.180 --> 00:42:02.860
(it's already caused great harm.)

00:42:02.860 --> 00:42:04.660
(I believe some people out there)

00:42:04.660 --> 00:42:06.420
(still misunderstand me.)

00:42:06.420 --> 00:42:07.220
(So I hope)

00:42:07.220 --> 00:42:09.260
(when facing similar situations,)

00:42:09.260 --> 00:42:11.660
(everyone can think for themselves.)

00:42:11.660 --> 00:42:14.900
(At the same time,
I'd like to take this chance)

00:42:14.900 --> 00:42:16.260
(This kind of thing takes two.)
(to appeal to everyone)

00:42:16.260 --> 00:42:17.780
(Both sides bear responsibility.)
(to please)

00:42:17.780 --> 00:42:18.860
(Fan Jiancheng is shameless.)
(give Ms. Ye)

00:42:18.860 --> 00:42:21.940
(How dare he say that?)
(a chance to turn over a new leaf,)

00:42:21.940 --> 00:42:23.620
(to find her way back,)

00:42:23.620 --> 00:42:24.780
(and start anew.)

00:42:28.220 --> 00:42:29.820
Mom!

00:42:31.580 --> 00:42:32.420
Mom!

00:42:33.340 --> 00:42:34.180
Mom!

00:42:34.333 --> 00:42:35.140
Call an ambulance!

00:42:35.140 --> 00:42:36.140
Dial 120!

00:42:36.140 --> 00:42:37.020
Dad, call an ambulance!

00:42:37.020 --> 00:42:37.860
Mom!

00:42:54.820 --> 00:43:00.420
(Emergency Room. Rescue Area.
No Unauthorized Entry)

00:43:16.540 --> 00:43:17.620
Miss, how is she?

00:43:17.620 --> 00:43:19.460
Miss, how's my wife?

00:43:19.644 --> 00:43:20.780
Sudden cerebral infarction.

00:43:20.888 --> 00:43:22.660
Fortunately, you brought her in quickly.

00:43:23.420 --> 00:43:24.420
For now,

00:43:24.420 --> 00:43:25.420
she's stabilized.

00:43:25.420 --> 00:43:27.022
Please go and complete her admission.

00:43:29.260 --> 00:43:29.980
Dad.

00:43:30.100 --> 00:43:30.980
Nianwen.

00:43:30.980 --> 00:43:31.820
I'll go handle it.

00:43:32.500 --> 00:43:33.380
You stay here.

00:43:34.220 --> 00:43:35.060
Alright.

00:43:36.420 --> 00:43:36.980
Dad.

00:43:36.980 --> 00:43:37.820
Sit down first.
