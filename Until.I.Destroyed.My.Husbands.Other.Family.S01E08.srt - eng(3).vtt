WEBVTT

00:00:03.837 --> 00:00:04.838
You and I...

00:00:08.508 --> 00:00:09.743
are getting a divorce.

00:00:17.884 --> 00:00:20.754
No, please, Minori. Don't say that.

00:00:22.355 --> 00:00:25.892
You're the only one I love!
You have to believe me!

00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:34.401
Liar.

00:00:41.274 --> 00:00:42.275
Minori?

00:00:42.842 --> 00:00:44.811
Tsubasa and I will leave tomorrow.

00:00:46.012 --> 00:00:47.247
Sign the papers.

00:00:47.881 --> 00:00:48.882
Minori, wait...

00:00:58.024 --> 00:01:00.794
So, where are you staying now?

00:01:03.396 --> 00:01:05.265
At a hotel with Tsubasa.

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:09.335
You held on.

00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:11.571
I'm proud of you.

00:01:13.673 --> 00:01:14.674
But...

00:01:16.876 --> 00:01:18.344
But it's not over yet.

00:01:21.848 --> 00:01:22.849
Wataru.

00:01:29.989 --> 00:01:30.990
Wataru!

00:01:33.526 --> 00:01:34.527
You...

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:38.531
What do you want?

00:02:26.713 --> 00:02:31.818
UNTIL I DESTROYED
MY HUSBAND'S OTHER FAMILY

00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:35.955
Are you here to ridicule me?

00:02:38.391 --> 00:02:39.392
Ridicule you?

00:02:41.661 --> 00:02:42.662
Why?

00:02:44.164 --> 00:02:45.565
Isn't this enough?

00:02:50.203 --> 00:02:51.538
Give me back my Wataru.

00:02:53.473 --> 00:02:54.741
Give you back?

00:02:55.608 --> 00:02:57.343
Stop it!

00:02:58.211 --> 00:03:00.580
You took my son from me!

00:03:03.016 --> 00:03:04.083
I took him?

00:03:05.185 --> 00:03:06.719
Yes, you did!

00:03:07.487 --> 00:03:10.423
You flirted with him
to trick him, didn't you?!

00:03:10.490 --> 00:03:14.027
It's not my fault that Wataru
doesn't want to come home, is it?

00:03:20.166 --> 00:03:22.268
Don't you say his name!

00:03:24.671 --> 00:03:26.339
It's all your fault!

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:28.308
He's changed

00:03:29.042 --> 00:03:30.877
ever since he met you.

00:03:32.212 --> 00:03:34.280
What you're doing is a crime.

00:03:35.782 --> 00:03:37.383
You manipulated a high schooler

00:03:38.851 --> 00:03:40.386
and even kidnapped him!

00:03:50.763 --> 00:03:51.764
So...

00:03:57.070 --> 00:03:59.572
Adultery is not a crime?

00:04:02.408 --> 00:04:03.409
What?

00:04:06.312 --> 00:04:07.347
Isn't it a crime

00:04:09.282 --> 00:04:13.453
to have an affair
and wreck someone's family?

00:04:20.627 --> 00:04:21.794
Hey, Riko.

00:04:25.465 --> 00:04:28.334
How does it feel
to have lost your precious family?

00:04:32.538 --> 00:04:33.840
Stop messing with me!

00:04:39.045 --> 00:04:41.648
You're the one messing with me!

00:04:49.922 --> 00:04:51.357
Damn it.

00:04:52.992 --> 00:04:56.796
Damn it!

00:05:07.740 --> 00:05:09.742
Just tell me where Wataru is.

00:05:11.210 --> 00:05:12.211
Please.

00:05:19.185 --> 00:05:20.720
I'm sorry!

00:05:22.288 --> 00:05:25.158
I apologize for everything I did!

00:05:32.231 --> 00:05:34.367
Please give me back my son!

00:05:57.757 --> 00:05:58.758
Wataru!

00:06:00.593 --> 00:06:03.663
Where have you been?
I've been so worried!

00:06:05.698 --> 00:06:07.667
She did something to you?

00:06:08.835 --> 00:06:10.303
Minori did nothing.

00:06:12.772 --> 00:06:14.440
I just ran off.

00:06:15.775 --> 00:06:16.776
So...

00:06:17.944 --> 00:06:19.245
don't blame her.

00:06:20.880 --> 00:06:23.683
Why are you defending this woman?

00:06:24.550 --> 00:06:28.054
I get it.
She's threatening you, right?

00:06:28.121 --> 00:06:29.122
No.

00:06:30.390 --> 00:06:31.591
It's all my doing.

00:06:33.726 --> 00:06:35.361
I just fell in love with her.

00:06:39.665 --> 00:06:41.134
Fell in love?

00:06:43.269 --> 00:06:45.004
You're joking!

00:06:47.907 --> 00:06:50.510
Stop it!

00:06:54.414 --> 00:06:57.917
Why, why her, of all people?

00:06:59.719 --> 00:07:02.021
A pathetic woman,
fooled by her husband!

00:07:02.088 --> 00:07:03.089
Mom!

00:07:03.689 --> 00:07:04.690
Wataru.

00:07:07.393 --> 00:07:08.394
Do you know

00:07:10.730 --> 00:07:11.731
it was your mom

00:07:13.966 --> 00:07:16.035
who cut my hair?

00:07:18.237 --> 00:07:19.238
What?

00:07:20.673 --> 00:07:21.674
But you...

00:07:24.510 --> 00:07:26.779
didn't tell Yudai, did you?

00:07:32.018 --> 00:07:34.687
I wondered

00:07:36.155 --> 00:07:37.156
why you didn't.

00:07:40.993 --> 00:07:42.295
But I realized.

00:07:47.800 --> 00:07:49.068
Were you afraid?

00:07:51.604 --> 00:07:55.208
Did you think that if he found out
I knew about the affair

00:07:57.410 --> 00:08:00.012
he'd drop you in a heartbeat

00:08:01.314 --> 00:08:04.951
because what he really wanted
was my money?

00:08:06.819 --> 00:08:07.820
You did, didn't you?

00:08:10.790 --> 00:08:12.124
For Yudai

00:08:13.793 --> 00:08:17.296
you're nothing more than a mistress.

00:08:20.199 --> 00:08:21.200
So...

00:08:23.669 --> 00:08:24.737
you couldn't tell him.

00:08:24.871 --> 00:08:25.938
No!

00:08:27.106 --> 00:08:29.375
Yudai has loved only me!

00:08:29.442 --> 00:08:31.377
Not you! Me!

00:08:31.777 --> 00:08:33.779
He promised he'd marry me

00:08:34.480 --> 00:08:36.549
no matter what!

00:08:43.756 --> 00:08:44.757
Maybe he did.

00:08:48.761 --> 00:08:52.265
Money or not,
Yudai might have chosen you.

00:08:54.333 --> 00:08:55.334
That's right.

00:08:56.335 --> 00:08:58.204
He'd never--

00:08:58.271 --> 00:09:00.339
But can you choose him?

00:09:04.377 --> 00:09:05.578
What does that mean?

00:09:07.847 --> 00:09:08.848
Mom.

00:09:10.583 --> 00:09:11.584
I...

00:09:12.151 --> 00:09:13.419
I'll come home...

00:09:17.723 --> 00:09:20.126
if you break up with Yudai.

00:09:25.031 --> 00:09:26.032
He can't...

00:09:31.537 --> 00:09:33.739
make you truly happy.

00:09:38.744 --> 00:09:39.879
You choose me

00:09:41.547 --> 00:09:42.882
or him.

00:09:45.518 --> 00:09:46.686
It's up to you.

00:10:08.040 --> 00:10:09.041
How have you been?

00:10:11.110 --> 00:10:12.111
Okay.

00:10:13.212 --> 00:10:15.615
I'm glad I finally got a hold of you.

00:10:16.682 --> 00:10:19.485
I'm sorry I made you worry.

00:10:23.122 --> 00:10:24.357
It's finally over.

00:10:27.326 --> 00:10:28.327
Riko.

00:10:29.762 --> 00:10:31.030
I'm sorry for the wait.

00:10:31.664 --> 00:10:32.798
Now we can--

00:10:32.865 --> 00:10:33.933
We should break up.

00:10:37.870 --> 00:10:38.871
What?

00:10:44.076 --> 00:10:45.077
It's time

00:10:47.246 --> 00:10:48.247
we ended this.

00:10:49.415 --> 00:10:51.417
What are you talking about?

00:10:52.551 --> 00:10:55.087
I divorced for you and Wataru.

00:10:56.922 --> 00:10:58.057
Yudai.

00:10:58.858 --> 00:10:59.859
Yes?

00:11:02.728 --> 00:11:03.896
Have you really

00:11:07.299 --> 00:11:08.367
loved me?

00:11:11.203 --> 00:11:12.571
Of course!

00:11:15.675 --> 00:11:18.344
Riko, you have to believe me.

00:11:19.278 --> 00:11:22.415
We've always loved each other.

00:11:25.651 --> 00:11:26.686
I loved you.

00:11:27.553 --> 00:11:28.788
- Or
- Please pick it up.

00:11:28.854 --> 00:11:31.257
- I wanted someone to love me.
- I don't want to!

00:11:31.323 --> 00:11:32.324
Watch it!

00:11:33.592 --> 00:11:34.694
I'm sorry.

00:11:38.364 --> 00:11:41.267
- Here.
- Thank you.

00:11:42.702 --> 00:11:43.703
Miyake?

00:11:45.771 --> 00:11:46.939
Kisaragi?

00:11:54.814 --> 00:11:55.815
Are you okay?

00:11:57.383 --> 00:12:00.386
I let myself depend on him.

00:12:01.454 --> 00:12:02.455
Hey.

00:12:05.357 --> 00:12:07.259
Aren't you going to leave her?

00:12:08.928 --> 00:12:09.929
I am.

00:12:11.230 --> 00:12:12.231
But...

00:12:13.733 --> 00:12:14.734
I have to

00:12:16.001 --> 00:12:17.236
take care of something.

00:12:18.871 --> 00:12:20.673
What are you saying?

00:12:24.310 --> 00:12:26.779
Use this money to start your salon.

00:12:29.381 --> 00:12:30.683
That woman

00:12:31.650 --> 00:12:35.121
is going to come into a fortune.

00:12:36.322 --> 00:12:37.323
A fortune?

00:12:37.389 --> 00:12:41.393
Until then, my son cannot
divorce her. Please be patient.

00:12:49.101 --> 00:12:50.469
Even so

00:12:51.537 --> 00:12:54.106
he had become someone
I couldn't live without.

00:12:57.076 --> 00:12:58.911
Can I see you tonight?

00:12:59.845 --> 00:13:02.882
What, tonight? Why? What's wrong?

00:13:03.215 --> 00:13:04.950
Nothing.

00:13:06.252 --> 00:13:08.187
I just want to see you.

00:13:10.456 --> 00:13:12.057
I want to see you, too

00:13:12.424 --> 00:13:14.160
but I told her I'd come home early.

00:13:18.197 --> 00:13:21.300
Okay. That's fine.
I'm sorry about that.

00:13:22.535 --> 00:13:26.272
Is money really the only reason
he won't divorce?

00:13:27.072 --> 00:13:28.440
I've kept pretending

00:13:29.375 --> 00:13:31.477
not to see that fear.

00:13:36.282 --> 00:13:37.416
That's not true.

00:13:39.685 --> 00:13:41.787
I couldn't see you when I needed you

00:13:42.955 --> 00:13:44.790
for more than ten years.

00:13:47.626 --> 00:13:49.995
How could you say I've been loved?

00:13:50.262 --> 00:13:52.531
Well, that's because the money...

00:13:52.832 --> 00:13:53.866
Liar.

00:14:00.506 --> 00:14:01.507
You...

00:14:03.642 --> 00:14:05.244
love your wife.

00:14:09.782 --> 00:14:10.950
No!

00:14:13.219 --> 00:14:14.753
Did Wataru say something?

00:14:15.521 --> 00:14:18.724
He showed up at my office
to tell me to break up with you.

00:14:20.526 --> 00:14:21.527
Wataru did?

00:14:22.461 --> 00:14:26.999
It turned into a real issue at work,
and I got suspended because of it.

00:14:32.404 --> 00:14:33.739
Pathetic.

00:14:34.807 --> 00:14:35.808
What?

00:14:43.349 --> 00:14:44.617
We're pathetic

00:14:46.118 --> 00:14:48.654
both you and me.

00:14:59.832 --> 00:15:00.866
Goodbye.

00:15:02.334 --> 00:15:03.369
Wait!

00:15:05.504 --> 00:15:07.106
What about the baby?

00:15:08.974 --> 00:15:11.477
You needed my help to raise Wataru.

00:15:11.543 --> 00:15:13.245
I don't need your help!

00:15:19.251 --> 00:15:21.520
You're not part of my family,
you know.

00:15:39.471 --> 00:15:41.407
That was a big sigh.

00:15:43.042 --> 00:15:45.844
What's up? She dumped you?

00:15:47.212 --> 00:15:49.782
- Nothing like that.
- Really?

00:15:50.616 --> 00:15:52.151
I wish she would already.

00:15:55.421 --> 00:15:56.922
Just tell her you like her.

00:15:59.291 --> 00:16:00.893
Then you'll crash and burn.

00:16:03.362 --> 00:16:04.363
What?

00:16:05.931 --> 00:16:07.099
Wataru.

00:16:08.200 --> 00:16:09.268
You have no idea...

00:16:11.603 --> 00:16:14.139
what it's like to love someone

00:16:14.907 --> 00:16:16.041
you shouldn't.

00:16:22.047 --> 00:16:23.782
- I know!
- No, you don't.

00:16:23.849 --> 00:16:25.217
I do, goddamn it!

00:16:31.824 --> 00:16:32.891
I'm sorry.

00:16:38.630 --> 00:16:39.631
Well...

00:16:40.799 --> 00:16:41.800
do what you want.

00:16:43.569 --> 00:16:45.404
If you can take the punishment.

00:16:52.344 --> 00:16:53.946
Here, I'm giving this back.

00:16:56.148 --> 00:16:57.149
What?

00:17:07.092 --> 00:17:08.093
Bye.

00:17:41.894 --> 00:17:43.062
Goddamn it!

00:17:45.964 --> 00:17:47.099
Are you okay?

00:17:59.745 --> 00:18:01.647
I don't think it's bad.

00:18:02.881 --> 00:18:03.882
Adultery.

00:18:04.349 --> 00:18:05.951
- What?
- Because

00:18:06.318 --> 00:18:08.153
you can't help falling in love.

00:18:13.125 --> 00:18:14.126
Thank you.

00:18:15.160 --> 00:18:18.430
Only you would take
my side like this.

00:18:19.598 --> 00:18:21.433
After my suspension,
let's get dinner.

00:18:24.536 --> 00:18:25.938
I don't think

00:18:26.939 --> 00:18:28.173
I'm on your side.

00:18:29.241 --> 00:18:30.242
What?

00:18:30.809 --> 00:18:32.411
I'm okay with adultery.

00:18:33.145 --> 00:18:36.115
But getting caught is another story.

00:18:37.549 --> 00:18:40.486
You underestimated
both your wife and mistress.

00:18:41.019 --> 00:18:43.288
You thought they'd never catch on.

00:18:43.622 --> 00:18:45.657
- No, I never--
- You know

00:18:46.458 --> 00:18:49.495
I hate men who look down on women.

00:18:50.129 --> 00:18:52.698
So I wanted to tell you face to face.

00:18:53.565 --> 00:18:54.566
What?

00:18:58.737 --> 00:19:00.405
Go to hell.

00:19:01.940 --> 00:19:03.108
You scumbag.

00:19:10.349 --> 00:19:11.350
Bye!

00:19:15.053 --> 00:19:16.421
He's being demoted.

00:19:16.655 --> 00:19:20.492
Yikes! Bad deeds really catch up
with you, don't they?

00:19:22.060 --> 00:19:24.596
- Just say no to cheating.
- Just say no to cheating.

00:19:31.336 --> 00:19:33.205
That's so lame. Seriously!

00:19:33.672 --> 00:19:36.575
- That's enough.
- I was shocked!

00:19:36.842 --> 00:19:38.544
You were betraying your wife?

00:19:39.278 --> 00:19:42.247
- You're an idiot!
- Keep it down!

00:19:43.549 --> 00:19:44.616
But seriously

00:19:45.551 --> 00:19:47.419
you really married her for money?

00:19:48.187 --> 00:19:49.188
What?

00:19:51.723 --> 00:19:53.192
Yes, I sure did.

00:19:53.926 --> 00:19:55.127
That's mind-boggling.

00:19:55.928 --> 00:19:57.129
I know.

00:19:58.030 --> 00:20:00.999
Marrying someone
you don't even like for money--

00:20:01.066 --> 00:20:02.167
That's not it.

00:20:02.801 --> 00:20:03.802
What?

00:20:04.570 --> 00:20:06.338
Even if it's for the money

00:20:07.272 --> 00:20:09.241
can you really stake your life?

00:20:11.109 --> 00:20:12.110
Isn't it because

00:20:13.011 --> 00:20:14.046
you loved her

00:20:14.880 --> 00:20:17.316
that you stayed together for so long?

00:20:36.168 --> 00:20:37.703
- Three, two, one.
- Three, two, one.

00:20:37.769 --> 00:20:39.538
- Hi, Dad!
- Hi, Dad!

00:20:42.174 --> 00:20:43.175
Minori.

00:20:44.543 --> 00:20:45.544
Tsubasa.

00:21:22.281 --> 00:21:25.017
What the hell am I doing?

00:21:35.193 --> 00:21:38.764
YUDAI

00:21:59.685 --> 00:22:00.686
Minori.

00:22:09.561 --> 00:22:11.163
What a mess.

00:22:14.866 --> 00:22:15.967
You wanted to talk?

00:22:19.771 --> 00:22:20.906
And the divorce papers?

00:22:22.507 --> 00:22:23.508
Did you sign them?

00:22:36.088 --> 00:22:37.389
You haven't.

00:22:40.992 --> 00:22:41.993
Why not?

00:22:47.432 --> 00:22:51.203
I know an apology
won't make it right.

00:22:52.504 --> 00:22:54.773
But please

00:22:56.041 --> 00:22:57.209
forgive me.

00:23:04.783 --> 00:23:05.784
Is there any way...

00:23:09.187 --> 00:23:10.188
we could...

00:23:11.690 --> 00:23:14.359
start over? You and me?

00:23:19.131 --> 00:23:20.699
Is this because Riko dumped you?

00:23:23.034 --> 00:23:25.370
Or you're feeling a bit lonely?

00:23:26.972 --> 00:23:28.607
- No.
- Then what?

00:23:30.876 --> 00:23:31.877
I...

00:23:34.713 --> 00:23:36.448
started dating you

00:23:37.015 --> 00:23:38.750
because my mom told me to.

00:23:40.852 --> 00:23:41.853
But the truth was

00:23:43.355 --> 00:23:44.990
I liked Riko.

00:23:49.961 --> 00:23:50.962
It was

00:23:52.164 --> 00:23:53.432
all for the money.

00:23:56.835 --> 00:23:57.836
I...

00:24:02.374 --> 00:24:04.476
I didn't love you, Minori.

00:24:10.882 --> 00:24:11.883
But

00:24:14.019 --> 00:24:16.888
though you may not believe me...

00:24:19.958 --> 00:24:21.526
since we got married

00:24:23.462 --> 00:24:24.830
and we had Tsubasa...

00:24:32.103 --> 00:24:33.705
Over all these years

00:24:35.941 --> 00:24:36.942
I think you two

00:24:39.177 --> 00:24:40.378
have become

00:24:42.147 --> 00:24:44.316
the most important people in my life.

00:24:51.556 --> 00:24:52.657
Important?

00:24:54.493 --> 00:24:55.594
Give me a break.

00:24:56.728 --> 00:24:57.896
I know it's too late.

00:25:00.765 --> 00:25:02.801
But with you and Tsubasa gone...

00:25:05.170 --> 00:25:07.606
I finally realized.

00:25:09.107 --> 00:25:11.276
So...

00:25:12.177 --> 00:25:13.178
please.

00:25:17.349 --> 00:25:18.783
Can you give me...

00:25:22.787 --> 00:25:24.322
just one more chance?

00:25:29.027 --> 00:25:30.595
I'm really sorry

00:25:32.597 --> 00:25:33.865
that I hurt you so much.

00:25:53.518 --> 00:25:54.519
You know...

00:25:57.255 --> 00:25:58.690
I took revenge on you.

00:26:00.792 --> 00:26:01.793
What?

00:26:03.862 --> 00:26:04.863
I wanted you...

00:26:07.632 --> 00:26:09.467
to realize the sins

00:26:11.736 --> 00:26:13.338
you've committed.

00:26:18.710 --> 00:26:20.679
I used Wataru for that

00:26:23.214 --> 00:26:25.183
and took everything from you.

00:26:32.691 --> 00:26:35.860
I wanted you to know what it's like

00:26:36.995 --> 00:26:39.698
to be betrayed
by someone you trusted!

00:26:42.200 --> 00:26:43.635
I wanted to tear you apart

00:26:45.103 --> 00:26:47.439
and destroy everything.

00:26:50.141 --> 00:26:51.943
I wanted to make you beg me

00:26:53.445 --> 00:26:55.747
for forgiveness,
no matter what it took!

00:26:59.484 --> 00:27:00.485
I thought

00:27:02.287 --> 00:27:03.855
that would save me...

00:27:06.891 --> 00:27:08.793
and make me feel better.

00:27:14.466 --> 00:27:15.467
But...

00:27:18.770 --> 00:27:20.305
the pain is still there.

00:27:26.511 --> 00:27:29.547
I wanted to see you in despair.

00:27:31.916 --> 00:27:34.452
I hate you so much I could kill you.

00:27:38.657 --> 00:27:40.825
But each time I get you cornered...

00:27:44.262 --> 00:27:45.697
the pain gets worse.

00:27:48.833 --> 00:27:49.834
Perhaps

00:27:51.703 --> 00:27:52.704
it wasn't

00:27:54.639 --> 00:27:57.442
that I wanted to hurt you.

00:28:00.478 --> 00:28:01.813
Instead...

00:28:08.219 --> 00:28:09.220
I only...

00:28:13.825 --> 00:28:15.927
wanted you to look at me.

00:28:19.531 --> 00:28:20.532
I only

00:28:21.266 --> 00:28:23.568
wanted you to know

00:28:25.537 --> 00:28:27.072
that I'm here.

00:28:30.809 --> 00:28:31.810
I only...

00:28:35.647 --> 00:28:37.782
wanted you to love me.

00:28:50.028 --> 00:28:51.796
I'm so sorry.

00:28:57.469 --> 00:28:59.904
I'll never put you
through this again.

00:29:03.908 --> 00:29:04.909
Minori.

00:29:07.846 --> 00:29:08.980
I love you.

00:29:11.850 --> 00:29:13.451
I'm telling the truth now.

00:29:23.528 --> 00:29:24.529
So...

00:29:28.299 --> 00:29:29.467
let's start over.

00:29:32.704 --> 00:29:34.305
Please.

00:29:43.948 --> 00:29:45.083
I'm glad.

00:29:47.085 --> 00:29:48.086
Minori.

00:29:54.592 --> 00:29:55.593
But...

00:29:58.062 --> 00:29:59.063
do you mean it?

00:30:01.432 --> 00:30:02.433
Of course.

00:30:04.235 --> 00:30:05.236
I love you

00:30:05.770 --> 00:30:08.740
from the bottom of my heart.

00:30:13.878 --> 00:30:14.879
Minori.

00:30:16.381 --> 00:30:17.415
I love you.

00:30:20.685 --> 00:30:21.753
I don't feel it.

00:30:23.421 --> 00:30:24.422
What?

00:30:26.291 --> 00:30:27.592
Say it again.

00:30:30.728 --> 00:30:31.796
I love you.

00:30:40.538 --> 00:30:41.539
It's not working.

00:30:50.248 --> 00:30:51.249
You know what?

00:30:53.418 --> 00:30:54.419
I can't...

00:30:57.222 --> 00:30:58.723
trust you anymore.

00:31:07.632 --> 00:31:09.500
I'll do anything.

00:31:11.436 --> 00:31:15.573
I'll be a good husband, a good dad!

00:31:21.913 --> 00:31:22.914
Then...

00:31:26.184 --> 00:31:28.753
why did you cheat?

00:31:33.258 --> 00:31:34.325
I'm sorry.

00:31:35.393 --> 00:31:37.762
I'm sorry.

00:31:39.664 --> 00:31:40.665
I'm really sorry.

00:31:42.200 --> 00:31:43.201
Forgive me.

00:31:57.515 --> 00:31:59.317
I'm on my way to get Tsubasa.

00:32:00.785 --> 00:32:01.786
Yes.

00:32:03.087 --> 00:32:04.088
Sara.

00:32:05.523 --> 00:32:06.758
Thank you so much.

00:32:08.092 --> 00:32:10.194
Okay. See you later.

00:33:45.757 --> 00:33:48.226
Thank you for waiting. Let's go!

00:33:49.894 --> 00:33:52.163
Mom, where are we going on the bus?

00:33:54.632 --> 00:33:55.900
Well...

00:33:59.070 --> 00:34:00.805
we are going to our new house.

00:34:06.611 --> 00:34:09.080
- Tsubasa?
- What about Dad?

00:34:24.529 --> 00:34:25.530
I'm sorry.

00:34:27.832 --> 00:34:29.067
We are not going to

00:34:30.935 --> 00:34:32.437
live with Dad anymore.

00:34:33.671 --> 00:34:34.772
Why not?

00:34:37.475 --> 00:34:40.812
Mom, you don't like Dad anymore?

00:34:45.516 --> 00:34:47.652
No, it's not like that.

00:34:48.853 --> 00:34:52.256
He's your Dad.
How can I not like him?

00:34:52.924 --> 00:34:54.592
Is it my fault?

00:34:56.094 --> 00:34:57.095
What?

00:34:57.495 --> 00:35:01.599
Did you and Dad fight because of me?

00:35:07.972 --> 00:35:08.973
No, we didn't.

00:35:10.675 --> 00:35:12.477
You did nothing wrong.

00:35:16.147 --> 00:35:19.050
Dad and I both love you so much.

00:35:23.387 --> 00:35:24.388
I'm sorry

00:35:25.256 --> 00:35:26.724
we made you sad.

00:35:32.864 --> 00:35:33.865
But...

00:35:36.434 --> 00:35:39.203
I promise I'll make you happy.

00:35:41.472 --> 00:35:42.473
Mom?

00:35:46.844 --> 00:35:49.580
Bus 283 is leaving shortly.

00:35:50.114 --> 00:35:52.517
All passengers,
please board immediately.

00:35:54.385 --> 00:35:56.320
- Shall we?
- Okay.

00:36:00.191 --> 00:36:01.459
We're boarding!

00:36:02.260 --> 00:36:03.961
- Mom, come on!
- I'm coming.

00:36:06.197 --> 00:36:07.899
Up we go!

00:36:10.801 --> 00:36:11.802
Minori!

00:36:18.009 --> 00:36:19.010
Wataru!

00:36:20.945 --> 00:36:22.013
Please don't go!

00:36:24.982 --> 00:36:26.651
I just need you to be here.

00:36:27.885 --> 00:36:29.720
I want nothing more.

00:36:35.660 --> 00:36:36.661
I'm sorry.

00:36:42.033 --> 00:36:43.668
I hurt you so much

00:36:45.536 --> 00:36:46.837
because of my revenge.

00:36:52.310 --> 00:36:53.311
I'm truly...

00:36:55.880 --> 00:36:56.881
sorry.

00:36:59.617 --> 00:37:02.153
I'm okay.

00:37:03.221 --> 00:37:05.690
You let me realize my mistakes.

00:37:06.791 --> 00:37:09.260
You don't need
to be sorry about anything.

00:37:14.532 --> 00:37:15.533
So...

00:37:18.236 --> 00:37:19.270
Minori...

00:37:26.310 --> 00:37:27.478
We are about to depart.

00:37:33.251 --> 00:37:34.252
I'm sorry.

00:37:35.886 --> 00:37:37.221
Minori!

00:37:41.692 --> 00:37:43.461
Was I just a student to you?

00:37:55.172 --> 00:37:56.207
Wataru.

00:37:59.910 --> 00:38:01.078
I just want you...

00:38:03.514 --> 00:38:05.383
to live your own life.

00:38:32.510 --> 00:38:34.412
- It's super delicious!
- Really?

00:38:34.478 --> 00:38:36.514
Ready for a new love?

00:38:36.580 --> 00:38:37.648
Ask for his number.

00:38:38.082 --> 00:38:39.684
He's my son's teacher.

00:38:40.084 --> 00:38:41.352
Is this possible?
