00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:53.700
(Xuanzheng Hall)

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:56.910
Who are you?

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:03.520
I am Grand Princess Fuhui of Protection,

00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:05.910
sent by His Majesty,

00:02:05.910 --> 00:02:08.120
bearing the Imperial Seal,

00:02:08.400 --> 00:02:11.080
(Xuanzheng Hall)
to denounce Prince Zhao's treason.

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:12.900
Prince Zhao has committed high treason.

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:14.920
All of the Li clan

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:16.710
have the right to punish him.

00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:19.030
If you continue to obstruct,

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:20.920
you will share his guilt.

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:23.800
You will be executed,

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:26.120
and all your clans will be exterminated.

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:29.400
If you lay down your weapons now,

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:31.990
His Majesty will deal
with you leniently.

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:44.870
Lin Yan,

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:47.920
you're not dead.

00:02:49.270 --> 00:02:51.480
The Li clan's target for punishment

00:02:51.710 --> 00:02:53.270
is probably someone else.

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:55.360
The people will only know

00:02:56.420 --> 00:02:58.640
that the Grand Princess
and the Crown Prince

00:02:58.940 --> 00:03:00.120
conspired to commit treason.

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:01.310
Guards,

00:03:01.960 --> 00:03:03.100
kill Princess Fuhui

00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:04.290
and seize the seal.

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:05.270
Yes.

00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:14.550
Lin Yan,

00:03:14.830 --> 00:03:15.670
I raised you

00:03:16.310 --> 00:03:17.990
for 17 years.

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:19.590
17 years.

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:23.310
Yet you're so ungrateful

00:03:23.710 --> 00:03:25.080
and go against me.

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:27.710
You have trapped yourself

00:03:27.710 --> 00:03:29.080
in this deadly situation.

00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:31.960
Well,

00:03:33.520 --> 00:03:34.520
you somewhat resemble

00:03:34.520 --> 00:03:35.960
my eldest son,

00:03:36.990 --> 00:03:37.830
so I'll grant you

00:03:38.270 --> 00:03:39.710
a whole body in death.

00:03:47.710 --> 00:03:48.960
You are not Lin Yan.

00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:52.960
Where is Lin Yan?

00:03:54.180 --> 00:03:55.020
So,

00:03:55.620 --> 00:03:56.940
your father was

00:03:56.940 --> 00:03:59.580
the celebrated Prefect back then?

00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:01.740
Yes.

00:04:02.140 --> 00:04:03.170
Prince Zhao exterminated

00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:04.700
your entire clan.

00:04:05.060 --> 00:04:06.860
Prince Zhao is plotting treason,

00:04:07.220 --> 00:04:08.770
and you'll stand against him?

00:04:09.860 --> 00:04:10.700
Yes.

00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:12.460
Why do you trust me so much?

00:04:13.300 --> 00:04:14.700
Such a shocking secret.

00:04:14.870 --> 00:04:17.180
If I reported it to Prince Zhao

00:04:17.710 --> 00:04:18.840
and he succeeded,

00:04:19.770 --> 00:04:21.580
I could rise to power easily.

00:04:22.340 --> 00:04:23.180
Would you?

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:27.260
Li Ji betrayed his friend

00:04:27.940 --> 00:04:29.620
and was despised by the world.

00:04:30.670 --> 00:04:32.660
I would never do such a thing.

00:04:34.220 --> 00:04:35.460
In this life,

00:04:35.670 --> 00:04:36.700
to have a true friend,

00:04:37.140 --> 00:04:38.220
to kill a traitor,

00:04:39.180 --> 00:04:40.540
to live and sing,

00:04:41.140 --> 00:04:41.980
that is enough.

00:04:45.820 --> 00:04:46.700
He's on the road

00:04:46.700 --> 00:04:48.700
to send you to the netherworld to atone.

00:04:49.500 --> 00:04:52.060
(Prince Zhao's Mansion)

00:05:18.300 --> 00:05:19.180
Mr. Lu,

00:05:19.820 --> 00:05:21.380
Prince Zhao has succeeded.

00:05:21.820 --> 00:05:22.660
Do you think

00:05:23.220 --> 00:05:25.300
he will consider you a threat?

00:05:27.100 --> 00:05:28.620
Noble Consort Dou is related to you,

00:05:28.940 --> 00:05:30.180
but she won't protect you.

00:05:30.500 --> 00:05:31.340
You should know

00:05:31.540 --> 00:05:33.260
that today,
Prince Zhao is trying to kill

00:05:33.540 --> 00:05:35.580
his own siblings.

00:05:37.900 --> 00:05:40.020
You're familiar
with the Yong'an Code, right?

00:05:41.260 --> 00:05:43.220
You only know
that treason is a capital offense,

00:05:43.420 --> 00:05:45.260
but Article 13 of the Yong'an Code

00:05:45.260 --> 00:05:46.900
clearly states

00:05:47.540 --> 00:05:49.260
that those who report treason

00:05:49.640 --> 00:05:51.420
may have their sentences reduced,

00:05:51.420 --> 00:05:52.820
depending on the info they provide.

00:05:54.260 --> 00:05:55.620
You mean,

00:05:56.120 --> 00:05:57.220
I have a chance to survive?

00:05:57.560 --> 00:06:00.020
I only want
to bring Prince Zhao to justice.

00:06:03.860 --> 00:06:05.260
Prince Zhao will besiege the Palace.

00:06:06.820 --> 00:06:08.260
To prevent news from leaking,

00:06:09.160 --> 00:06:10.340
after he succeeds,

00:06:11.420 --> 00:06:13.640
he will claim that the Crown Prince
committed treason,

00:06:13.820 --> 00:06:15.230
and he has to kill him.

00:06:15.930 --> 00:06:17.620
The Noble Consort
will support this claim.

00:06:18.020 --> 00:06:19.700
But to control the Noble Consort,

00:06:21.980 --> 00:06:23.980
Prince Zhao
has kept their correspondence

00:06:26.260 --> 00:06:28.460
hidden in the study of Fuyi Manor.

00:06:33.140 --> 00:06:34.060
Thank you.

00:06:35.940 --> 00:06:36.980
By the way,

00:06:37.660 --> 00:06:38.580
the Yong'an Code

00:06:38.780 --> 00:06:40.140
only has 12 articles.

00:06:45.420 --> 00:06:46.500
12 articles?

00:06:49.100 --> 00:06:49.940
Lin Yan,

00:06:50.260 --> 00:06:51.660
how dare you trick me?

00:06:51.910 --> 00:06:53.300
You will not die a good death.

00:06:53.300 --> 00:06:55.740
(Complete and Bright)

00:07:19.020 --> 00:07:24.500
(Prince Zhao's Mansion)

00:07:50.580 --> 00:07:52.300
Mr. Lin and I

00:07:53.540 --> 00:07:56.020
anticipated today's events.

00:07:56.820 --> 00:08:00.220
We had the Sixteen Guards ready.

00:08:00.900 --> 00:08:03.820
I risked my life

00:08:03.910 --> 00:08:06.180
to make you let your guard down

00:08:06.310 --> 00:08:08.340
and send all your men out.

00:08:09.140 --> 00:08:10.180
Otherwise,

00:08:10.180 --> 00:08:11.580
if you still had

00:08:11.580 --> 00:08:13.340
one or two men left,

00:08:14.020 --> 00:08:16.180
they'd harm the commoners.

00:08:19.540 --> 00:08:21.340
Mr. Lin has gone to Suishui City.

00:08:22.300 --> 00:08:23.580
He must've obtained

00:08:23.580 --> 00:08:25.940
the evidence of your communication
with Noble Consort Dou.

00:08:26.420 --> 00:08:27.700
You cannot escape

00:08:28.580 --> 00:08:29.860
the charge of treason.

00:08:32.820 --> 00:08:35.020
The military tally is in my hands.

00:08:35.580 --> 00:08:37.140
All generals, listen.

00:08:37.700 --> 00:08:40.820
Today, Prince Zhao
must be brought to justice.

00:08:47.620 --> 00:08:51.900
(Xuanzheng Gate)

00:09:13.980 --> 00:09:15.780
Save the Prince!

00:09:15.780 --> 00:09:17.460
Kill!

00:10:07.100 --> 00:10:07.940
Let's go.

00:10:08.220 --> 00:10:09.060
Go.

00:10:19.700 --> 00:10:20.540
Oh, no.

00:10:33.380 --> 00:10:35.020
Hurry, hurry.

00:10:35.220 --> 00:10:36.860
Finally, I've rescued all of you.

00:10:37.020 --> 00:10:38.660
Or my young master would be anxious.

00:10:38.770 --> 00:10:40.140
You'll be out of the Palace soon.

00:10:40.380 --> 00:10:41.260
I have to go back.

00:10:41.260 --> 00:10:42.380
I can only take you this far.

00:10:42.380 --> 00:10:43.700
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

00:10:43.700 --> 00:10:44.640
Take care of yourselves.

00:10:49.060 --> 00:10:50.260
- Go.
- Hurry, go.

00:10:50.260 --> 00:10:51.100
Yangyang.

00:10:58.500 --> 00:10:59.900
Prince Zhao, Li Ang.

00:10:59.900 --> 00:11:00.860
Run! Hurry!

00:11:00.860 --> 00:11:01.980
Yangyang, Yangyang.

00:11:02.300 --> 00:11:03.140
Dad, Mom.

00:11:03.140 --> 00:11:04.540
Jicai, hurry up.

00:11:04.540 --> 00:11:06.460
Dad, Mom, we can't let them go.

00:11:20.020 --> 00:11:20.860
Hurry, hurry.

00:11:31.790 --> 00:11:32.750
Hurry.

00:11:33.280 --> 00:11:34.300
Hurry, Jicai.

00:11:40.420 --> 00:11:41.460
Let's go, Li Ang.

00:11:43.380 --> 00:11:44.780
How dare you stop me?

00:11:45.600 --> 00:11:46.540
Don't come any closer.

00:11:46.540 --> 00:11:48.020
Dad, take care of Yangyang.

00:11:49.660 --> 00:11:50.500
Run!

00:11:50.500 --> 00:11:51.340
Gongcai!

00:11:57.820 --> 00:11:58.980
- Shaojie!
- Dad!

00:11:58.980 --> 00:12:00.200
- I'll fight you!
- Mom.

00:12:03.860 --> 00:12:05.100
Li Ang, let's go.

00:12:05.100 --> 00:12:07.100
Lin Yan disfigured me.

00:12:07.260 --> 00:12:08.100
You shall pay

00:12:08.740 --> 00:12:10.020
for his crime.

00:12:27.940 --> 00:12:28.780
- Lin Yan.
- Jicai.

00:12:28.980 --> 00:12:30.020
Let Li Ang go,

00:12:30.300 --> 00:12:31.420
or I'll kill her.

00:12:31.420 --> 00:12:32.290
No.

00:12:32.290 --> 00:12:33.140
Let her go.

00:12:33.140 --> 00:12:33.980
Let him go.

00:12:35.780 --> 00:12:36.700
Release him.

00:12:40.340 --> 00:12:41.180
Mr. Lin.

00:12:58.940 --> 00:12:59.940
Let her go.

00:13:00.980 --> 00:13:01.820
Don't move.

00:13:02.100 --> 00:13:02.940
I'll take her place.

00:13:03.300 --> 00:13:04.140
Cui Che,

00:13:05.500 --> 00:13:06.940
I was soft-hearted back then

00:13:07.550 --> 00:13:08.980
and spared your life.

00:13:09.180 --> 00:13:10.020
Today,

00:13:10.670 --> 00:13:12.060
I'll give you my life.

00:13:12.460 --> 00:13:13.580
Let him go.

00:13:13.980 --> 00:13:14.820
Father.

00:13:14.940 --> 00:13:15.790
Don't move.

00:13:17.500 --> 00:13:18.340
Let him go.

00:13:19.160 --> 00:13:20.740
Let him go!

00:13:36.780 --> 00:13:38.100
- No.
- Leave.

00:13:38.100 --> 00:13:39.100
Father.

00:13:39.100 --> 00:13:40.060
Go!

00:13:49.060 --> 00:13:49.980
Leave now.

00:13:54.260 --> 00:13:55.140
Let go of Jicai.

00:13:55.380 --> 00:13:56.300
Release her.

00:13:56.580 --> 00:13:58.180
- Auntie.
- I'll take her place.

00:13:58.420 --> 00:13:59.260
Don't move.

00:14:00.140 --> 00:14:00.980
Today,

00:14:01.700 --> 00:14:03.020
I'm in a dead end.

00:14:04.220 --> 00:14:05.060
I'll have

00:14:07.700 --> 00:14:09.020
the woman you cherish most

00:14:10.420 --> 00:14:12.260
accompany me in death.

00:14:17.300 --> 00:14:18.340
- Jicai!
- Jicai!

00:14:48.980 --> 00:14:54.130
♪Like a sunken boat in a dark current,
not a single light of night is seen♪

00:14:55.470 --> 00:15:01.680
♪Ahead is hazy,
light and shadow interlaced♪

00:15:04.900 --> 00:15:05.740
Your Highness,

00:15:06.020 --> 00:15:08.180
if we spare Cui Che

Good, just right.

00:18:12.980 --> 00:18:14.940
I heard your family
has achieved great merit,

00:18:15.260 --> 00:18:17.100
and the Emperor inscribed this plaque.

00:18:17.660 --> 00:18:19.180

The former Prefect, Cui Ning,

00:18:50.860 --> 00:18:52.380
was honest, loyal,

00:18:52.820 --> 00:18:54.220
and righteous.

00:18:54.820 --> 00:18:57.460

have been cleared.

The good name of the Cui family
shall be restored.

00:19:00.860 --> 00:19:02.260
Prince Zhao was the true culprit

00:19:02.420 --> 00:19:05.060
behind the post-selling case
17 years ago,

00:19:05.620 --> 00:19:07.460
and he conspired with Noble Consort Dou

00:19:07.460 --> 00:19:09.100

Thank you, Your Majesty.

00:19:33.620 --> 00:19:34.460
Your Majesty,

00:19:34.780 --> 00:19:37.020
the Cui case is truly lamentable,

00:19:37.440 --> 00:19:39.300
but it is my duty

00:19:39.310 --> 00:19:41.570
to impeach the Vice Prefect
of the Prefecture,

00:19:41.570 --> 00:19:42.420
Lin Yan.

00:19:42.670 --> 00:19:44.300
Lin Yan is actually Cui Che.

00:19:44.780 --> 00:19:45.740
When he achieved merit

00:19:45.740 --> 00:19:47.020
and governed the Capital,

00:19:47.210 --> 00:19:48.900
he was still a criminal.

00:19:49.140 --> 00:19:50.220
He pretended

00:19:50.220 --> 00:19:52.100
to be someone else

00:19:52.100 --> 00:19:53.820
and deceived you, Your Majesty.

00:19:54.220 --> 00:19:55.740
It cannot be overlooked.

00:19:55.900 --> 00:19:56.740
How absurd.

00:19:57.620 --> 00:19:58.460
Your Majesty,

00:19:59.140 --> 00:20:01.100
Mr. Lin changed his identity

00:20:01.100 --> 00:20:02.260
out of necessity

00:20:02.260 --> 00:20:04.540
to clear his father's name.

00:20:04.940 --> 00:20:06.460
This is an act of filial piety.

00:20:06.900 --> 00:20:07.860
If we trace it back,

00:20:08.100 --> 00:20:09.550
isn't the Censorate also responsible

00:20:09.560 --> 00:20:11.960
for the Cui family's injustice?

00:20:12.450 --> 00:20:13.460
Prince Zhao's treason

00:20:13.460 --> 00:20:14.590
had signs early on.

00:20:14.790 --> 00:20:16.700
The Censorate used to be so evasive.

00:20:17.220 --> 00:20:19.100
Why so persistent

00:20:19.460 --> 00:20:21.180
with Mr. Lin now?

00:20:25.480 --> 00:20:27.000
In suppressing Prince Zhao's rebellion,

00:20:27.030 --> 00:20:28.820
Mr. Lin deserves the greatest credit.

00:20:28.980 --> 00:20:30.820
To pursue past grievances now

00:20:30.980 --> 00:20:33.420
would discourage
the loyal and righteous.

00:20:33.820 --> 00:20:34.660
Your Majesty,

00:20:35.700 --> 00:20:37.660
a ruler must be clear
in rewards and punishments

00:20:37.660 --> 00:20:39.100
to establish the law

00:20:39.100 --> 00:20:39.940
and the foundation.

00:20:40.390 --> 00:20:42.380
We should reward good deeds

00:20:42.660 --> 00:20:44.900
and punish bad ones.

00:20:45.180 --> 00:20:46.060
Otherwise,

00:20:46.190 --> 00:20:47.480
the law will not be established,

00:20:47.580 --> 00:20:48.940
and the foundation will be shaken.

00:20:49.330 --> 00:20:52.380
If everyone follows Mr. Lin's example,

00:20:52.380 --> 00:20:53.740
changing their names

00:20:54.140 --> 00:20:56.780
and entering the court as a criminal,

00:20:57.020 --> 00:20:59.220
how shall we govern?

00:21:03.780 --> 00:21:05.780
Your Majesty, please punish him
to uphold the law.

00:21:05.780 --> 00:21:07.100
Your Majesty, please punish him.

00:21:07.300 --> 00:21:08.560
Your Majesty, please punish him

00:21:08.560 --> 00:21:09.660
to uphold the law.

00:21:09.660 --> 00:21:10.920
Your Majesty, please punish him

00:21:10.920 --> 00:21:12.080
to uphold the law.

00:21:12.420 --> 00:21:13.700
To uphold the law.

00:21:21.860 --> 00:21:22.900
Don't sneak a bite.

00:21:23.500 --> 00:21:25.420
- Here come the dishes.
- Get the spoons ready.

00:21:29.300 --> 00:21:30.980
There are two dishes left.

00:21:30.980 --> 00:21:31.940
Be good, Ming.

00:21:31.940 --> 00:21:33.740
It's quite a feast today.

00:21:34.180 --> 00:21:35.020
Come on.

00:21:35.540 --> 00:21:36.380
Here, here.

00:21:43.740 --> 00:21:45.100
- What's wrong?
- My head hurts.

00:21:45.100 --> 00:21:45.940
Dad,

00:21:46.640 --> 00:21:47.940
- What's wrong?
- What's wrong?

00:21:47.940 --> 00:21:49.220
- Gongcai.
- What's going on?

00:21:49.220 --> 00:21:50.060
Dad.

00:21:50.900 --> 00:21:52.260
- Gongcai.
- I'm fine.

00:21:53.460 --> 00:21:55.380
Ever since Li Ang

00:21:55.380 --> 00:21:57.100
hit my head with something,

00:21:57.100 --> 00:21:58.540
I've been feeling headaches.

00:21:59.700 --> 00:22:00.860
There are always

00:22:01.220 --> 00:22:03.220
all kinds of strange things
flashing in my head.

00:22:03.260 --> 00:22:05.260
Hurry up and see a doctor.

00:22:05.260 --> 00:22:06.100
Yeah.

00:22:06.100 --> 00:22:07.140
Should we see a doctor?

00:22:07.340 --> 00:22:08.180
No need.

00:22:08.360 --> 00:22:09.020
With his skills,

00:22:09.020 --> 00:22:10.760
is it worth spending money
on a physician?

00:22:10.760 --> 00:22:12.280
I'll be fine in a couple of days.

00:22:12.940 --> 00:22:14.270
- This child.
- Right.

00:22:14.980 --> 00:22:16.660
His Majesty said we have merits,

00:22:16.980 --> 00:22:17.980
and he will reward us.

00:22:17.980 --> 00:22:19.140
What should we ask for?

00:22:19.580 --> 00:22:21.380
Yeah, I've been thinking about this.

00:22:23.020 --> 00:22:24.260
How about 10,000 taels of gold?

00:22:25.320 --> 00:22:26.860
- Good.
- That's too vulgar.

00:22:26.980 --> 00:22:28.660
Not vulgar at all.

00:22:30.260 --> 00:22:32.340
Let's just ask for a few tens
of thousands of carts

00:22:32.340 --> 00:22:34.500
of pepper, silk, or something like that.

00:22:34.500 --> 00:22:36.180
- You...
- Thousands of carts?

00:22:36.740 --> 00:22:38.380
Jicai, you're like a lion,

00:22:38.380 --> 00:22:39.420
asking for so much.

00:22:39.660 --> 00:22:41.460
We've done something so important.

00:22:41.460 --> 00:22:42.300
I think

00:22:42.820 --> 00:22:44.140
we shouldn't trouble His Majesty.

00:22:44.260 --> 00:22:46.700
How about I ask for a post,

00:22:46.700 --> 00:22:48.300
like the head of Juxian Alley?

00:22:48.300 --> 00:22:49.140
Good.

00:22:49.480 --> 00:22:50.540
That works.

00:22:51.700 --> 00:22:52.620
From now on...

00:22:52.620 --> 00:22:53.980
Bad news!

00:22:54.660 --> 00:22:56.540
- What's wrong?
- Mr. Lin has been imprisoned.

00:22:56.660 --> 00:22:58.440
He's been charged
with deceiving the Emperor

00:22:59.260 --> 00:23:00.660
and is to be executed.

00:23:01.460 --> 00:23:02.300
This...

00:23:36.140 --> 00:23:36.980
Thank you.

00:23:48.540 --> 00:23:50.020
It's past curfew,

00:23:50.700 --> 00:23:52.220
yet you still managed to come in.

00:23:53.780 --> 00:23:54.620
Yes.

00:23:55.380 --> 00:23:56.620
I spent a lot of money

00:23:56.940 --> 00:23:58.080
just to bring you this meal.

00:24:03.890 --> 00:24:06.340
Father made the Four-Joy Meatballs.

00:24:07.020 --> 00:24:08.820
Mother made the Peace and Longevity.

00:24:10.860 --> 00:24:13.620
Shen Shaojie made the Auspicious Fish.

00:24:13.620 --> 00:24:14.780
But you'd better not eat it.

00:24:19.700 --> 00:24:20.700
This is rice.

00:24:22.100 --> 00:24:23.540
This is the Happy Duck Egg.

00:24:23.940 --> 00:24:25.060
Yangyang pestered Yu San

00:24:25.060 --> 00:24:26.060
and Deyuan to teach her.

00:24:26.060 --> 00:24:27.280
She practiced for a long time.

00:24:36.820 --> 00:24:37.940
Did you make this?

00:24:40.180 --> 00:24:41.020
Is it sweet?

00:24:43.100 --> 00:24:44.740
Only you can eat this.

00:24:52.140 --> 00:24:52.980
Eat up.

00:24:56.540 --> 00:24:57.380
Is it good?

00:24:59.500 --> 00:25:00.340
Yes.

00:25:03.630 --> 00:25:04.980
Mother made this for a long time.

00:25:10.740 --> 00:25:11.740
I've thought it through.

00:25:12.020 --> 00:25:13.340
We have to beg them again.

00:25:13.440 --> 00:25:15.580
If worst comes to worst,
we'll break into the prison.

00:25:17.180 --> 00:25:18.020
Jicai,

00:25:18.620 --> 00:25:19.510
listen to me.

00:25:22.070 --> 00:25:23.180
You still have your family.

00:25:23.780 --> 00:25:24.700
No matter what,

00:25:25.240 --> 00:25:26.460
you can live on.

00:25:37.620 --> 00:25:38.460
Liar.

00:25:40.700 --> 00:25:41.820
You're a liar.

00:26:02.420 --> 00:26:03.260
Jicai,

00:26:05.660 --> 00:26:06.820
before I met you

00:26:07.380 --> 00:26:08.500
and your family,

00:26:09.740 --> 00:26:11.940
all I could think of was revenge.

00:26:12.940 --> 00:26:14.580
I was like a walking corpse.

00:26:16.100 --> 00:26:16.940
But you guys

00:26:18.940 --> 00:26:20.660
really feel like my family.

00:26:22.810 --> 00:26:23.820
With you,

00:26:24.910 --> 00:26:26.260
I've truly lived once,

00:26:28.330 --> 00:26:29.340
and that's enough.

00:26:31.280 --> 00:26:33.460
His Majesty said he'd give us a reward.

00:26:34.540 --> 00:26:36.300
I want to have your life.

00:26:37.460 --> 00:26:38.700
Your life is mine.

00:26:38.980 --> 00:26:40.340
No one can take it away.

00:27:13.320 --> 00:27:14.190
Your Highness,

00:27:14.200 --> 00:27:16.060
can't His Majesty spare Lin Yan?

00:27:17.040 --> 00:27:19.060
My brother doesn't want to kill Anran,

00:27:19.480 --> 00:27:20.320
but the better

00:27:20.870 --> 00:27:23.460
Anran does as the Vice Prefect,

00:27:23.820 --> 00:27:25.340
the more people he will offend.

00:27:25.740 --> 00:27:27.620
There will surely be someone
who envies him.

00:27:28.160 --> 00:27:29.500
Deceiving the Emperor

00:27:29.980 --> 00:27:31.660
is the perfect excuse.

00:27:32.220 --> 00:27:33.540
With solid evidence,

00:27:34.030 --> 00:27:35.540
His Majesty will surely act

00:27:36.220 --> 00:27:37.820
according to the law.

00:27:38.620 --> 00:27:40.020
Your Highness, I beg you.

00:27:40.020 --> 00:27:41.060
Please think of something.

00:27:41.860 --> 00:27:42.860
Lady Shen,

00:27:43.780 --> 00:27:45.860
think carefully.

00:27:45.860 --> 00:27:47.350
Your Highness, I beg you.

00:27:55.660 --> 00:27:57.580
His Majesty will surely act

00:27:57.900 --> 00:27:59.460
according to the law.

00:27:59.900 --> 00:28:00.940
If you want to save Anran,

00:28:01.180 --> 00:28:02.940
you have to think carefully

00:28:03.840 --> 00:28:05.500
about the laws and regulations.

00:28:08.740 --> 00:28:10.100
Do you understand?

00:28:13.540 --> 00:28:15.500
You've been talking about the law.

00:28:16.820 --> 00:28:18.340
The law can condemn Lin Yan,

00:28:20.220 --> 00:28:21.860
and the law can also save Lin Yan.

00:28:24.460 --> 00:28:25.660
You mean...

00:28:30.020 --> 00:28:31.300
Are you saying

00:28:32.940 --> 00:28:36.180
you want to ask for an Imperial Waiver

00:28:36.700 --> 00:28:38.940
so that Lin Yan can marry you

00:28:39.220 --> 00:28:40.180
and be protected

00:28:40.700 --> 00:28:42.340
from execution?

00:28:44.380 --> 00:28:45.220
Yes.

00:28:52.820 --> 00:28:54.980
(Xuanzheng Hall)
Lin Yan has been detained for days.

00:28:55.180 --> 00:28:57.580
Please sentence Lin Yan
to the ultimate punishment

00:28:57.580 --> 00:28:58.820
to uphold the nation's law.

00:28:59.340 --> 00:29:01.540
Indeed, we can no longer delay.

00:29:02.020 --> 00:29:02.940
Draft the decree.

00:29:03.100 --> 00:29:03.940
Your Majesty.

00:29:06.660 --> 00:29:07.620
Your Majesty,

00:29:07.620 --> 00:29:08.960
executing Lin Yan will demonstrate

00:29:09.100 --> 00:29:11.900
the strictness of our laws
and regulations.

00:29:12.050 --> 00:29:12.930
However,

00:29:13.310 --> 00:29:15.220
I must impeach you

00:29:15.220 --> 00:29:16.460
for being inconsistent

00:29:16.460 --> 00:29:17.620
and losing the people's trust.

00:29:20.460 --> 00:29:21.880
In quelling Prince Zhao's rebellion,

00:29:22.100 --> 00:29:25.460
the Shen family,
who operated in Juxian Alley,

00:29:25.590 --> 00:29:26.580
also made contributions.

00:29:26.580 --> 00:29:27.450
Therefore,

00:29:27.480 --> 00:29:30.300
you granted them an Imperial Waiver.

00:29:31.000 --> 00:29:32.220
Lady Shen

00:29:32.220 --> 00:29:34.420
is engaged to Lin Anran.

00:29:35.170 --> 00:29:37.860
Anran is part of the Shen family

00:29:37.980 --> 00:29:41.220
and is also protected
by the Imperial Waiver.

00:29:41.830 --> 00:29:43.510
The waiver's exemption from death

00:29:43.520 --> 00:29:44.980
has always taken precedence

00:29:45.150 --> 00:29:47.380
over other laws and regulations.

00:29:48.020 --> 00:29:48.940
Today,

00:29:48.940 --> 00:29:50.860
your decision to punish Lin Yan

00:29:51.500 --> 00:29:52.900
is actually illegal.

00:29:53.140 --> 00:29:53.980
Absurd.

00:29:54.180 --> 00:29:55.620
The Imperial Waiver

00:29:56.210 --> 00:29:57.620
was granted to the Shen family.

00:29:58.420 --> 00:29:59.300
Lin Yan

00:29:59.300 --> 00:30:00.460
has never been married,

00:30:00.460 --> 00:30:01.660
as everyone in the court knows.

00:30:01.660 --> 00:30:03.020
You can't overturn this

00:30:03.020 --> 00:30:04.060
with just a few words.

00:30:05.020 --> 00:30:06.180
Even if it's an engagement,

00:30:06.540 --> 00:30:08.860
it's Lady Shen marrying Lin Yan.

00:30:09.260 --> 00:30:10.420
According to this logic,

00:30:10.610 --> 00:30:12.740
Lady Shen should also be implicated.

00:30:12.740 --> 00:30:13.940
The Imperial Waiver

00:30:14.340 --> 00:30:16.620
can only ensure her own survival.

00:30:17.490 --> 00:30:18.420
Your Majesty,

00:30:18.620 --> 00:30:20.120
I have here their Letter of Marriage

00:30:20.120 --> 00:30:22.140
and the list of betrothal gifts.

00:30:22.140 --> 00:30:23.480
As an elder,

00:30:23.750 --> 00:30:25.040
I witnessed the reception

00:30:25.040 --> 00:30:27.630
of the Letter of Marriage

00:30:27.630 --> 00:30:28.980
and the betrothal gifts.

00:30:29.140 --> 00:30:30.040
Censor.

00:30:35.660 --> 00:30:36.660
Please take a look.

00:30:37.460 --> 00:30:39.020
(Lin Yan accepted the betrothal gifts)

00:30:39.020 --> 00:30:42.420
This is the list of betrothal gifts
that Lin Yan received.

00:30:42.420 --> 00:30:44.020
He is marrying into the family,

00:30:44.740 --> 00:30:48.460
so he is also protected
by the Imperial Waiver.

00:30:49.240 --> 00:30:50.340
How could this be?

00:30:50.340 --> 00:30:51.580
Marrying into the Shen family?

00:30:51.660 --> 00:30:53.300
How could

00:30:53.420 --> 00:30:54.380
the Vice Prefect

00:30:54.380 --> 00:30:56.020
do such a thing?

00:30:56.280 --> 00:30:57.140
Your Majesty,

00:30:57.140 --> 00:30:59.380
this must be a trick by Lin Yan.

00:31:00.660 --> 00:31:02.860
A ruler must be clear
in rewards and punishments

00:31:02.860 --> 00:31:04.460
to establish the law

00:31:04.460 --> 00:31:05.540
and the foundation.

00:31:05.540 --> 00:31:08.140
Since there is an Imperial Waiver
protecting his family,

00:31:08.420 --> 00:31:09.700
we must keep our promise.

00:31:10.100 --> 00:31:10.940
Otherwise,

00:31:11.160 --> 00:31:12.420
the law will not be established,

00:31:12.420 --> 00:31:13.780
and the foundation will be shaken.

00:31:13.840 --> 00:31:15.080
If everyone follows his example,

00:31:15.340 --> 00:31:16.980
how shall we govern?

00:31:17.500 --> 00:31:18.630
You...

00:32:16.460 --> 00:32:17.420
Now, it's settled.

00:32:17.860 --> 00:32:20.300
The clan law, the rules, the world

00:32:20.740 --> 00:32:22.200
won't tolerate two shameless sinners

00:32:22.200 --> 00:32:23.740
like us.

00:32:28.660 --> 00:32:29.740
If there is a hell,

00:32:31.020 --> 00:32:32.100
I'll go alone.

00:32:36.380 --> 00:32:37.220
Lin Yan,

00:32:37.460 --> 00:32:39.620
this is the only way I can save you.

00:32:40.330 --> 00:32:41.220
But a fake engagement

00:32:41.220 --> 00:32:43.060
can never become real in the end.

00:32:44.100 --> 00:32:46.000
Luckily, you've been restored
to your position.

00:32:46.500 --> 00:32:48.220
I've talked it over with my parents.

00:32:48.420 --> 00:32:50.060
Once this matter blows over,

00:32:50.060 --> 00:32:51.460
we will move away from Yong'an.

00:32:52.300 --> 00:32:53.700
I will go far away

00:32:54.380 --> 00:32:55.500
and never see you again.

00:32:56.580 --> 00:32:57.420
Shaoguang.

00:32:59.820 --> 00:33:02.020
The descendant has offended you.

00:33:02.420 --> 00:33:03.540
Ancestor,

00:33:05.820 --> 00:33:07.540
please forgive my sins.

What a sin.

Truly a sin.

00:34:16.260 --> 00:34:17.780
I thought these two

00:34:17.780 --> 00:34:19.380
would never see each other again,

00:34:19.740 --> 00:34:22.020
but His Majesty insisted
on putting them in a painting.

00:34:22.420 --> 00:34:23.460
That's right.

00:34:23.780 --> 00:34:26.020
It's like taking a wedding photo.

00:34:26.020 --> 00:34:27.940
My hair is standing on end.

00:34:27.940 --> 00:34:28.980
Exactly.

00:34:29.260 --> 00:34:30.340
It's terrifying.

00:34:38.010 --> 00:34:38.860
Mr. Lin.

00:34:38.860 --> 00:34:39.700
The painting is done.

00:35:17.500 --> 00:35:18.820
This...

00:35:19.220 --> 00:35:21.220
Isn't this the one hanging
in the ancestral hall?

00:35:26.300 --> 00:35:28.260
(Portrait of Lin Yan, Vice Prefect)

00:35:31.780 --> 00:35:32.620
Could it be

00:35:33.090 --> 00:35:35.100
that we are witnessing history here?

00:35:36.260 --> 00:35:37.220
No way.

00:35:40.420 --> 00:35:41.260
Jicai.

00:35:41.740 --> 00:35:42.580
Jicai,

00:35:42.780 --> 00:35:44.160
stand up straight, lift your head,

00:35:44.190 --> 00:35:45.320
and tuck in your chin a bit.

00:35:45.380 --> 00:35:47.060
Imagine there's an apple
under your chin.

00:35:47.060 --> 00:35:48.220
You'll look better that way.

00:35:48.220 --> 00:35:49.500
Yes, listen to your mom.

00:35:49.500 --> 00:35:51.850
Hold that apple and you'll look good.

00:35:51.850 --> 00:35:52.700
Right, right.

00:35:52.700 --> 00:35:54.660
Turn your head to the side a bit.

00:35:54.660 --> 00:35:55.700
You look fatter this way.

00:35:55.820 --> 00:35:56.660
Turn a bit more.

00:36:04.300 --> 00:36:05.780
Jicai, turn a bit more to this side.

00:36:06.100 --> 00:36:07.580
You forgot about the apple again.

00:36:07.580 --> 00:36:09.260
You have to hold the apple to look good.

00:36:09.260 --> 00:36:10.860
Too much. Come back a bit.

00:36:10.860 --> 00:36:12.340
You look better when you smile.

00:36:12.700 --> 00:36:14.540
- Expression.
- Show some emotion.

00:36:14.540 --> 00:36:15.740
You look better when you smile.

00:36:15.740 --> 00:36:16.940
Hold it.

00:36:17.420 --> 00:36:19.020
Your expression needs to be there.

00:36:19.300 --> 00:36:20.140
Like this.

00:36:20.890 --> 00:36:21.740
This is good enough.

00:36:21.740 --> 00:36:22.580
This is good.

00:36:23.260 --> 00:36:24.100
Hurry up and paint.

00:36:24.730 --> 00:36:25.580
Why this pose?

00:36:25.580 --> 00:36:26.540
You...

00:36:26.540 --> 00:36:27.380
Never mind.

00:36:27.380 --> 00:36:28.860
Let her be.

00:37:08.300 --> 00:37:09.660
Mr. Lin, the painting is done.

00:37:11.060 --> 00:37:11.900
Thank you.

00:37:12.380 --> 00:37:13.420
I'll take my leave now.

00:37:25.660 --> 00:37:26.740
It feels

00:37:27.460 --> 00:37:28.340
like something is off.

00:37:28.340 --> 00:37:29.660
Yes, it is.

00:37:30.020 --> 00:37:31.940
Jicai, come here and take a look.

00:37:32.100 --> 00:37:33.640
- It looks very much like you.
- Come.

00:37:34.620 --> 00:37:36.060
I can't quite put my finger on it,

00:37:36.060 --> 00:37:38.100
but something feels off.

00:37:38.260 --> 00:37:39.180
A bit fat, maybe?

00:37:39.580 --> 00:37:40.580
No, it's not fat.

00:37:40.580 --> 00:37:41.540

I wouldn't even bother with you.

If you keep doing this.

00:39:56.940 --> 00:39:58.500
I won't tell you

00:39:58.500 --> 00:40:00.620
the most crucial truth.

00:40:00.780 --> 00:40:02.180
Don't tell me then.

00:40:04.380 --> 00:40:05.340
How about this?

00:40:05.340 --> 00:40:07.140
As we agreed before,

00:40:08.580 --> 00:40:09.540
is that okay?

00:40:09.540 --> 00:40:11.660
Grandpa, you have to give me 3 yuan.

You brat.

00:40:12.940 --> 00:40:14.220
Just like your dad.

00:40:15.140 --> 00:40:15.980
Alright, sit down.

00:40:16.500 --> 00:40:17.820
Let me tell you.

00:40:20.130 --> 00:40:22.460
The most crucial truth is

00:40:22.900 --> 00:40:24.320
that it's all fake.

00:40:31.980 --> 00:40:34.100
Well, not exactly fake.

00:40:34.340 --> 00:40:35.220
The story

00:40:35.420 --> 00:40:36.980
is still real.

00:40:37.180 --> 00:40:38.700
The Vice Prefect

00:40:38.970 --> 00:40:42.580
did marry a lady surnamed Shen,

00:40:42.580 --> 00:40:44.980
but she was not our ancestor.

00:40:45.500 --> 00:40:46.990
Our true ancestor

00:40:47.300 --> 00:40:52.060
is actually a friend of Mr. Lin,

00:40:52.060 --> 00:40:54.580
Censor Pei Fei.

00:40:55.220 --> 00:40:56.340
Mr. Pei later

00:40:56.340 --> 00:40:58.580
married into our family.

00:40:59.180 --> 00:41:00.540
But I don't think

00:41:00.540 --> 00:41:04.060
he is as impressive as Mr. Lin,

00:41:04.060 --> 00:41:04.940
so

00:41:05.150 --> 00:41:07.100
I deliberately said that.

00:41:08.010 --> 00:41:09.030
I remember now.

00:41:09.320 --> 00:41:10.420
I remember now.

00:41:10.420 --> 00:41:11.260
What is it?

00:41:13.020 --> 00:41:13.980
Our ancestor

00:41:13.980 --> 00:41:15.420
was never Mr. Lin.

00:41:15.620 --> 00:41:17.100
It was Pei Fei.

00:41:17.100 --> 00:41:18.660
- What?
- Pei Fei?

00:41:18.660 --> 00:41:20.500
Grandpa thought Mr. Lin
was more impressive,

00:41:20.500 --> 00:41:21.700
so he deliberately said that.

00:41:21.930 --> 00:41:22.820
Jicai,

00:41:22.820 --> 00:41:24.140
there is absolutely no relation

00:41:24.140 --> 00:41:25.340
between you and Mr. Lin.

00:41:25.340 --> 00:41:26.880
You two can get married.
