28:00.740 --> 28:02.537
(closes drawer)

28:10.389 --> 28:13.219
(sets glasses on table)

28:13.354 --> 28:17.725
"Give strong drink unto him
that is ready to perish,

28:17.860 --> 28:20.990
and wine unto the bitter
in soul."

28:21.126 --> 28:23.432
-JEM: Amen.
-(Ray sighs)

28:23.568 --> 28:25.197
(Jem coughs, clears throat)

28:26.229 --> 28:27.969
(screws cap on bottle)

28:34.578 --> 28:36.505
Her Majesty the Queen.

28:38.843 --> 28:39.909
(grunts)

28:40.044 --> 28:42.148
(Jem inhales sharply)

28:43.351 --> 28:46.647
What happened to "for what
we are about to receive"?

28:53.756 --> 28:57.526
So it's only before eating
that you say grace?

28:59.832 --> 29:03.202
He don't mind if you have a few
fucking bevvies without a word?

29:14.583 --> 29:15.852
(exhales softly)

29:18.417 --> 29:20.247
You forgot to wipe your arse
this morning.

29:20.383 --> 29:23.217
I saw the shit in your pants.

29:23.353 --> 29:25.554
No, that were from yesterday.

29:27.025 --> 29:29.096
You dirty bastard.

29:35.172 --> 29:39.106
Is cleanliness next to
godliness, would you say?

29:44.607 --> 29:46.407
How do you know
he's not filthy?

29:46.542 --> 29:48.048
Is there any evidence
in the Bible

29:48.184 --> 29:50.948
that says God takes a bath
three times a week?

29:51.084 --> 29:52.950
Changes his undies every day?

29:53.086 --> 29:54.517
God doesn't need undies,

29:54.653 --> 29:56.116
'cause he's not full of shit
like you are.

29:56.251 --> 29:57.694
Oh, is that so?

29:57.829 --> 29:59.994
Has he got an endless supply
up there?

30:00.129 --> 30:02.800
Bet he never has to wear
the same pair twice.

30:04.736 --> 30:08.263
Does he like a nice, snug fit?

30:08.399 --> 30:10.500
Or does he like plenty of room

30:10.635 --> 30:15.373
for his big fucking God balls
to swing around in?

30:15.508 --> 30:18.772
You know, like massive
fucking church bells, them.

30:20.247 --> 30:22.176
Bet it's like
Canterbury Cathedral

30:22.311 --> 30:24.151
down below decks.

30:28.683 --> 30:30.861
You're going to hell, brother.

30:31.924 --> 30:33.996
Family reunion?

30:41.640 --> 30:43.571
Father Rippon died last week.

30:43.706 --> 30:45.876
Saw it in the paper.

30:46.940 --> 30:48.846
Don't read papers.

30:52.013 --> 30:54.483
Did you ever see him again?

30:54.618 --> 30:56.513
Is that a question?

31:01.052 --> 31:04.521
Did hear he were carted off to
the nuthouse a few years ago.

31:10.731 --> 31:13.033
-Please read that letter, Ray.
-When I were back on leave

31:13.169 --> 31:16.563
after third tour
of the province--

31:16.698 --> 31:19.206
lost two of our lads
on that one...

31:22.111 --> 31:24.343
...started to think
about him, Rippon.

31:25.843 --> 31:27.574
More I thought about him,
the more I wanted

31:27.710 --> 31:30.214
to pay him a visit,
have a catch-up.

31:30.349 --> 31:33.352
A debrief about
the good old days.

31:34.850 --> 31:38.187
Anyway, when I got home,
I looked him up.

31:38.322 --> 31:40.930
Weren't easy to find.

31:41.065 --> 31:42.926
Course, they'd moved him
around a bit.

31:43.062 --> 31:45.229
Business as usual.

31:45.364 --> 31:47.060
Tracked him down
in Huddersfield.

31:47.195 --> 31:48.797
Hmm.

31:48.932 --> 31:51.402
Should've seen me all
togged out in my number twos.

31:51.537 --> 31:53.834
I mean, for someone
that were in shit order

31:53.969 --> 31:56.813
most days of the week,
I smartened up well.

31:56.949 --> 32:00.145
Cacks under the mattress
the night before.

32:00.281 --> 32:03.577
Razor-sharp creases
front and back.

32:03.713 --> 32:05.246
I were bulling my boots
all morning.

32:05.382 --> 32:06.922
Like mirrors they were.

32:07.057 --> 32:09.917
This were
parade ground standard, Jem.

32:10.052 --> 32:12.022
Could've done
a ceremonial duty at Buck Pal,

32:12.157 --> 32:13.728
I looked that good.

32:13.864 --> 32:15.290
Number two dress and medals.

32:15.426 --> 32:17.991
I were that well turned out,

32:18.127 --> 32:20.128
I could hear our dear mother's
voice saying,

32:20.263 --> 32:21.933
"Come home, son.

32:22.068 --> 32:23.430
All is forgiven."

32:23.566 --> 32:25.774
-Number ones.
-The what?

32:25.909 --> 32:27.407
Number one dress at the palace.

32:27.542 --> 32:29.344
Yeah, right, right.
That's what I'm saying.

32:29.480 --> 32:31.344
I were that smart, you wouldn't
have known the difference.

32:31.479 --> 32:33.748
I suppose not
if you were pig-ignorant.

32:33.883 --> 32:35.084
(clears throat softly)

32:36.354 --> 32:38.114
Hmm.

32:38.250 --> 32:41.220
So, go round his house.

32:41.355 --> 32:44.092
Lovely little
grace-and-favor cottage

32:44.227 --> 32:46.862
paid for by His Holiness,
no doubt.

32:46.997 --> 32:50.158
Window boxes,
perfect little lawn,

32:50.293 --> 32:51.801
hedges trimmed.

32:51.936 --> 32:54.936
Knock on the door,
and there he is.

32:55.071 --> 32:58.107
All scrubbed up,
pink and shiny.

33:00.073 --> 33:01.803
He seemed so old.

33:03.014 --> 33:05.646
I remember him
as a big, strong bugger.

33:05.782 --> 33:07.082
And there he were,

33:07.218 --> 33:09.985
scrawny little old man
with a potbelly.

33:10.121 --> 33:12.186
I was surprised
at how small he looked.

33:12.322 --> 33:14.354
I said,
"Father Rippon, isn't it?

33:14.489 --> 33:16.554
"I'm collecting
for the Veterans Association.

33:16.689 --> 33:18.827
Would you mind if I stepped
inside for a moment?"

33:18.962 --> 33:20.194
I could tell he were impressed.

33:20.330 --> 33:22.197
"Oh, do come in.
Do come in, young man.

33:22.332 --> 33:25.033
You're very welcome, son.
Do come in."

33:25.169 --> 33:27.295
He's all fluffed up,
bustling about.

33:27.430 --> 33:28.663
The kettle's on.

33:28.798 --> 33:31.568
Fine china, biscuits,
the whole works.

33:31.704 --> 33:34.169
"You'll take a cuppa,
won't you, son?"

33:34.304 --> 33:36.011
So we sit down.

33:36.146 --> 33:38.175
We sit down
in his tidy little parlor,

33:38.311 --> 33:39.983
chatting about this and that.

33:40.118 --> 33:42.877
I say, "This is your parish,
is it, Father?"

33:43.012 --> 33:46.347
He says, "Oh, I'm currently
between parishes.

33:46.483 --> 33:48.320
Semiretired, you know."

33:48.456 --> 33:50.651
I said, "Oh,
that must be difficult

33:50.786 --> 33:53.525
after all the years
of service."

34:02.739 --> 34:04.566
We talk about...

34:04.701 --> 34:06.700
talking about
the state of things,

34:06.836 --> 34:09.869
the ungovernable,
godless youth.

34:10.005 --> 34:13.545
He asks me,
"Are you of the faith, son?"

34:14.951 --> 34:17.513
And I say, "Faith runs

34:17.648 --> 34:20.222
very deep in our family,
Father."

34:22.084 --> 34:24.024
He says, "Of course,
what I miss most of all

34:24.160 --> 34:26.126
is working with young people."

34:26.262 --> 34:28.791
I nearly choked
on my custard cream.

34:30.400 --> 34:32.828
Anyway, so, there's a lull
in the conversation,

34:32.963 --> 34:34.894
and he says, "Oh, I do
beg your pardon, Corporal.

34:35.030 --> 34:37.569
Perhaps you'd like
something stronger."

34:41.804 --> 34:44.279
I just look at him
for a long time.

34:47.647 --> 34:50.384
"Would you like
something stronger, Father?"

34:55.260 --> 34:57.320
I could see the thrill of it
coursing through him.

34:57.456 --> 34:58.821
He didn't dare believe.

34:58.956 --> 35:02.427
His face darkened,
his eyes all glittery.

35:02.562 --> 35:04.062
He said, "Well, I would
if you would."

35:04.197 --> 35:05.464
He starts to get up.

35:05.599 --> 35:09.370
I say, "I'm very strong,
Father Rippon."

35:10.903 --> 35:13.266
He sits back down as if
his legs went from under him.

35:13.402 --> 35:15.068
I say...

35:16.245 --> 35:18.915
"Would you like
to have a look?"

35:19.050 --> 35:20.478
I start
to unbutton my trousers.

35:20.614 --> 35:22.082
I thought he might have
a heart attack.

35:22.218 --> 35:23.447
He just couldn't believe it.

35:23.582 --> 35:24.610
It was like Christmas
come early.

35:24.746 --> 35:27.452
So I stood myself up...

35:27.588 --> 35:31.455
teasing open the buttons
like a rent boy.

35:31.591 --> 35:35.165
Dropped the cacks,
dropped my undies.

35:36.768 --> 35:39.430
I say, "There it is."

35:39.565 --> 35:42.004
I said,
"Lie down on the floor."

35:42.140 --> 35:45.741
He lies down,
eager to accommodate.

35:45.877 --> 35:47.438
I said, "In a crucifix.

35:47.573 --> 35:49.674
That would make me
nice and hard."

35:51.015 --> 35:52.706
Waddled forward a few steps.

35:52.842 --> 35:54.515
I'm stood right over him.

35:54.650 --> 35:57.877
Oh, there's one detail
I forgot to mention, Jem.

35:58.012 --> 36:00.321
For a few days
before I went round,

36:00.457 --> 36:03.558
I were on a diet
of Guinness and curry.

36:03.694 --> 36:07.120
And then the afternoon of,
I took a handful of laxatives.

36:10.135 --> 36:11.595
It were hard to get
the timing right.

36:11.730 --> 36:13.434
I was sat in my car
outside his house

36:13.570 --> 36:15.700
for a couple of hours,
and nothing was shifting.

36:16.967 --> 36:21.140
As soon as I felt
that stirring within,

36:21.275 --> 36:23.246
I knocked on his door.

36:24.648 --> 36:27.075
As I'm sitting there,
it's welling up inside me,

36:27.211 --> 36:29.580
and now I swear
I'm coming apart at the seams.

36:29.716 --> 36:32.079
The rivets are popping
out of me.

36:34.989 --> 36:38.327
The army teaches you to grin
and bear it, doesn't it, Jem?

36:39.926 --> 36:44.960
We do love the exquisite agony
of self-denial.

36:47.034 --> 36:48.804
So...

36:48.940 --> 36:50.570
I'm stood over him.

36:51.534 --> 36:53.274
(clicks tongue)

36:53.410 --> 36:57.711
I say,
"Don't recognize me, do you?"

36:57.847 --> 37:00.112
"What?"

37:00.247 --> 37:02.175
I say, "Little Ray.

37:03.420 --> 37:06.223
I'm your Little Ray
from the care home."

37:09.489 --> 37:11.027
Takes him a good few moments,

37:11.163 --> 37:14.060
his eyes flicking
this way and that.

37:14.195 --> 37:16.594
When the penny drops,

37:16.730 --> 37:20.061
fear runs through him
like electricity.

37:20.196 --> 37:22.537
And the stinking sweat
poured out of him.

37:22.673 --> 37:24.973
"Oh, please don't hurt me.
Please don't hurt me."

37:25.108 --> 37:27.277
I said, "Don't move.

37:28.873 --> 37:30.736
"If you move an inch,
I'll cut off

37:30.872 --> 37:32.742
"your meat and potatoes

37:32.878 --> 37:35.978
"and shove them down
your fucking throat.

37:36.113 --> 37:38.822
You can suck yourself off
for a change."

37:38.957 --> 37:40.555
Well, come to think of it,

37:40.690 --> 37:42.718
shame he didn't learn
to do that a few years ago.

37:42.853 --> 37:45.086
He might have been
self-sufficient.

37:46.828 --> 37:51.958
Shuffled forwards, about-turn,
very awkward,

37:52.093 --> 37:54.264
heels on his stringy
little arms.

37:54.399 --> 37:58.274
He flinched. I could tell it
hurt him, but he daren't move.

37:58.410 --> 38:01.069
"Now, look up the sluice pipe,
Father."

38:02.243 --> 38:04.413
And I squatted down.

38:05.609 --> 38:07.614
And I manured him.

38:08.786 --> 38:11.244
(laughing)

38:13.892 --> 38:15.787
(laughing): Now...

38:19.893 --> 38:23.899
This evacuation were in
three distinct phases.

38:24.034 --> 38:25.758
First, I sprayed...

38:25.894 --> 38:28.661
(laughing): sprayed him.

38:28.797 --> 38:30.703
Pebble-dashed him.

38:34.072 --> 38:37.644
Like a flock of pigeons
taking off, they were.

38:40.484 --> 38:44.420
Then a couple of waves
of hot lava.

38:46.251 --> 38:50.426
And finally, one... one big...
(continues laughing)

38:56.292 --> 39:01.463
...one big patty cake,
like wet cement,

39:01.598 --> 39:03.902
flops out of me.

39:05.206 --> 39:08.142
And he's retching and spitting,
and he daren't breathe in,

39:08.277 --> 39:10.244
but he has to breathe.

39:10.379 --> 39:11.875
And I'm laughing that much,

39:12.011 --> 39:15.352
I feared I might topple over
into my own filth.

39:19.123 --> 39:20.680
And that's it.

39:20.815 --> 39:23.457
Stood up.

39:23.593 --> 39:26.889
Little packet
of wet wipes in my pocket.

39:27.025 --> 39:30.663
Cleaned myself up...
(continues laughing)

39:30.798 --> 39:33.865
and walked out of there
light as a feather.

39:39.470 --> 39:40.608
(sighs)

39:52.650 --> 39:54.523
Did you believe that?

40:16.840 --> 40:18.747
Did he do you in the hole?

40:18.882 --> 40:19.911
Huh?

40:26.384 --> 40:28.018
No.

40:29.489 --> 40:31.657
I bet he didn't.

40:31.793 --> 40:34.629
Even at that age,
they were scared of you.

40:38.696 --> 40:40.261
(sets bottle down)

40:40.396 --> 40:43.838
Where were you when he was
fucking me up the hole?

40:43.973 --> 40:46.007
Huh?

40:46.143 --> 40:48.137
He done me proper.

40:50.180 --> 40:52.240
He done me proper.

41:00.454 --> 41:02.316
(picks up bottle)

41:12.263 --> 41:14.933
Didn't have much luck
with fathers, did we?

41:30.583 --> 41:31.953
How about some tunes?

He left us.

Something to be proud of?

War crime.

01:25:58.715 --> 01:26:01.287
That's what he called it--
a war crime.

01:26:05.453 --> 01:26:07.623
Fucking war crime me?

01:26:08.788 --> 01:26:11.121
The war were the fucking crime.

01:26:13.431 --> 01:26:15.697
And we were
the phantom soldiers.

01:26:23.040 --> 01:26:27.340
Our mission on this one were
surveillance, pure and simple.

01:26:27.476 --> 01:26:29.075
We dug in at nighttime.

01:26:29.211 --> 01:26:30.912
Two OPs.

01:26:31.047 --> 01:26:33.886
Ours were in a hedgerow at
the end of an unpaved laneway

01:26:34.022 --> 01:26:36.389
bordering the farm buildings.

01:26:36.524 --> 01:26:38.390
The structure of interest
were the milking shed

01:26:38.525 --> 01:26:42.395
no more than 30, 40 feet
from us across the yard.

01:26:42.530 --> 01:26:45.496
On a tip-off, we'd scouted it
a few nights before.

01:26:47.498 --> 01:26:49.830
They arrived
shortly after sunup.

01:26:51.131 --> 01:26:53.703
The bomb maker were a player
well-known to us.

01:26:53.838 --> 01:26:56.540
The young lad with him,
we'd never seen him before.

01:26:59.047 --> 01:27:01.477
Our intel was solid, but...

01:27:01.612 --> 01:27:03.407
for two days,
there were no movement.

01:27:03.542 --> 01:27:05.517
We started to wonder if they'd
somehow slipped away,

01:27:05.652 --> 01:27:08.155
if there were a...
a tunnel or concealed entrance

01:27:08.290 --> 01:27:10.488
we'd missed
when we recced the building.

01:27:11.856 --> 01:27:15.394
I was just writing up my report
when the bomb went off.

01:27:22.670 --> 01:27:26.273
The explosion was so loud
you couldn't hear it.

01:27:28.539 --> 01:27:30.568
The concussive force
ran through

01:27:30.704 --> 01:27:32.368
every cell of your body.

01:27:32.504 --> 01:27:36.374
Filled you up, like there were
nothing left of you.

01:27:36.510 --> 01:27:38.318
Just chaos.

01:27:39.915 --> 01:27:41.781
The entire roof lifted
off the shed

01:27:41.917 --> 01:27:44.915
on a cloud of black smoke,
like a cartoon.

01:27:45.050 --> 01:27:47.753
Walls swelled outwards,
opened up.

01:27:47.888 --> 01:27:50.022
Debris started
to rain down on us.

01:27:50.158 --> 01:27:52.558
"Are we being attacked?
Do they know we're here?

01:27:52.694 --> 01:27:54.193
Are they getting rid of it?"

01:27:54.328 --> 01:27:56.126
They'd do that sometimes.
You know how it were.

01:27:56.261 --> 01:27:57.765
If they... they thought
you were onto them,

01:27:57.901 --> 01:28:00.472
they'd detonate the ordnance
and scarper.

01:28:00.607 --> 01:28:05.702
And we were waiting
for the incoming, but so far,

01:28:05.837 --> 01:28:07.776
there were nothing.

01:28:11.280 --> 01:28:14.079
Then there were just the sound
of this fella screaming.

01:28:18.758 --> 01:28:21.019
Like I said, we were on
surveillance, nothing more.

01:28:21.155 --> 01:28:23.020
We weren't equipped
for anything serious.

01:28:23.156 --> 01:28:27.027
Sidearms only,
couple of longs between us.

01:28:27.162 --> 01:28:29.432
When that Semtex went off,
we should've called it in,

01:28:29.567 --> 01:28:31.765
hand it over to your lads,
but...

01:28:31.901 --> 01:28:34.303
(chuckling):
I don't know why, but...

01:28:34.439 --> 01:28:36.700
for some reason, we moved in.

01:28:36.835 --> 01:28:38.807
Advance to contact.

01:28:40.472 --> 01:28:43.343
I suppose it were a
"ride to the sound of the guns"

01:28:43.478 --> 01:28:44.845
type of madness.

01:28:44.980 --> 01:28:46.948
We started to crawl
toward the milking shed.

01:28:47.083 --> 01:28:49.753
Could've been weapons
trained on us, snipers.

01:28:49.889 --> 01:28:51.583
Could've been another bomb
waiting in the building.

01:28:51.718 --> 01:28:53.320
We didn't know.

01:28:53.455 --> 01:28:55.527
(birds calling)

01:28:57.260 --> 01:29:01.031
So we're crawling, heads down,
getting closer, getting closer.

01:29:01.166 --> 01:29:02.831
All we could...

01:29:05.471 --> 01:29:07.836
The only sound
were the screaming.

01:29:09.610 --> 01:29:11.472
Obviously, we wanted to get
one of them alive,

01:29:11.608 --> 01:29:13.776
if we could, get him to talk.

01:29:16.680 --> 01:29:18.283
It were that smoky
in the building

01:29:18.419 --> 01:29:20.651
you could barely see
in front of you.

01:29:20.786 --> 01:29:22.846
Well, it turned out
it were just the two of them,

01:29:22.981 --> 01:29:25.554
master and apprentice.

01:29:25.689 --> 01:29:27.158
And the player
must have been stood

01:29:27.294 --> 01:29:28.753
between the bomb and the kid.

01:29:28.889 --> 01:29:30.760
There were nowt left of him.

01:29:31.826 --> 01:29:33.257
Except his fucking teeth,

01:29:33.392 --> 01:29:35.930
buried in the side
of the young fella's head.

01:29:37.868 --> 01:29:40.407
Heard it were his nephew
a few days later.

01:29:42.401 --> 01:29:45.742
And I must have slipped
when we went in on some...

01:29:45.878 --> 01:29:49.779
piece of him, because I were
covered in, you know...

01:29:49.915 --> 01:29:53.882
When I picked myself up,
I were covered in his slime.

01:29:58.050 --> 01:29:59.816
The kid were on the ground.

01:29:59.951 --> 01:30:03.322
Bits of him were...

01:30:03.457 --> 01:30:08.100
He were alive, just about,
but bits of him were missing.

01:30:08.236 --> 01:30:09.765
His innards were spilled out,

01:30:09.901 --> 01:30:12.032
and he were crying out
for his mother.

01:30:14.073 --> 01:30:17.169
Bomb maker's teeth buried
in the side of his head.

01:30:19.313 --> 01:30:20.744
I was stood right over him.

01:30:20.879 --> 01:30:24.148
Our three lads clearing
the room left and right.

01:30:24.284 --> 01:30:26.386
I'm stood over him.

01:30:26.521 --> 01:30:29.585
He were dying, this kid, Jem.
He were dying.

01:30:29.720 --> 01:30:31.887
I could see the fear
in his eyes.

01:30:32.951 --> 01:30:35.226
The fucking hatred.

01:30:35.362 --> 01:30:38.125
He looked at me with hatred.

01:30:38.260 --> 01:30:40.825
Couldn't have been
more than 16 or 17 years old.

01:30:40.960 --> 01:30:43.498
Younger than Brian is now.

01:30:43.633 --> 01:30:45.439
He's screaming at me.

01:30:48.143 --> 01:30:50.800
Begging me to shoot him.

01:30:50.936 --> 01:30:52.512
So I shot him.

01:31:05.720 --> 01:31:07.251
He were dying?

01:31:07.387 --> 01:31:09.320
Yes, Jem, he were
fucking dying. He fucking...

01:31:09.455 --> 01:31:11.393
I didn't fucking kill him.
He killed himself.

01:31:11.529 --> 01:31:13.322
Fucking killed himself.

01:31:13.458 --> 01:31:15.397
I just nudged him
across the line.

01:31:15.533 --> 01:31:16.997
Fucking little bastard.

01:31:17.133 --> 01:31:19.130
Where were they gonna
put that bomb? In a pub?

01:31:19.265 --> 01:31:21.004
In a shopping center?
In a nightclub?

01:31:21.140 --> 01:31:22.800
Guaranteed, there'd be
innocent people blown to bits.

01:31:22.935 --> 01:31:24.267
How fucking merciful.

01:31:24.402 --> 01:31:25.772
Turns out they just
killed themselves.

01:31:25.908 --> 01:31:27.546
And I'm the fucking murderer?

01:31:27.682 --> 01:31:30.517
I wish... I wish
I had left him to die.

01:31:33.350 --> 01:31:36.148
I wish I'd left him to
his full measure of suffering.

01:31:36.284 --> 01:31:37.783
Lying there with his guts
spilled out,

01:31:37.918 --> 01:31:39.049
crying for his mother.

01:31:39.184 --> 01:31:41.118
I should've left him there.

01:31:41.254 --> 01:31:43.122
Should've called an ambulance.

01:31:43.258 --> 01:31:45.455
Told 'em to take
the scenic route.

01:31:47.801 --> 01:31:50.563
I'm not fucking making out
I did him a favor,

01:31:50.699 --> 01:31:52.061
but I fucking did.

01:31:52.197 --> 01:31:54.198
He were begging me to do it.

01:31:54.333 --> 01:31:56.570
17 years old,
shivering on the ground,

01:31:56.706 --> 01:31:58.776
and I finished him off.

01:32:00.579 --> 01:32:02.549
Just to stop the screaming.

01:32:13.828 --> 01:32:15.725
And that's it.
That's all there were.

01:32:15.861 --> 01:32:18.464
Yeah, listen,
of course they... lads knew.

01:32:18.600 --> 01:32:21.134
The lads... lads knew
what I'd done.

01:32:21.270 --> 01:32:22.829
They didn't question it.

01:32:22.965 --> 01:32:24.327
They knew this fella were gone

01:32:24.463 --> 01:32:26.306
and no one would get
anything out of him.

01:32:26.441 --> 01:32:27.735
By the time
we got him anywhere,

01:32:27.871 --> 01:32:29.266
he-he wouldn't have survived.

01:32:29.402 --> 01:32:31.677
No one said a word.
No one questioned it.

01:32:33.741 --> 01:32:35.846
(birds calling)

01:32:38.516 --> 01:32:39.883
No one said a word.

01:32:42.219 --> 01:32:45.016
But I called it into South Det
operations room.

01:32:45.152 --> 01:32:46.857
That stage, our job were done.

01:32:46.993 --> 01:32:49.761
Handed over, went back
to barracks, had the debrief.

01:32:49.896 --> 01:32:51.595
That boy's injuries--
didn't occur to me

01:32:51.731 --> 01:32:53.963
any questions would be asked,
but...

01:32:56.195 --> 01:32:58.303
They were all in a twist.

01:32:58.439 --> 01:33:00.871
The Ruperts, the higher-ups.

01:33:02.803 --> 01:33:05.838
So, after...

01:33:05.974 --> 01:33:07.737
the CO had me in his office.

01:33:07.873 --> 01:33:09.847
Uh...

01:33:11.409 --> 01:33:13.887
I could tell
he were under stress.

01:33:14.022 --> 01:33:17.415
His whole fat head looked like
a boil that needed lancing.

01:33:18.924 --> 01:33:20.955
"By all the rules
of lawful engagement,

01:33:21.091 --> 01:33:23.394
that's a war crime,
Sergeant Stoker."

01:33:23.529 --> 01:33:25.055
Oh, hello. Here we go.

01:33:25.191 --> 01:33:26.629
He's looking hard at me.

01:33:26.765 --> 01:33:29.597
"We need to make this go away.

01:33:29.733 --> 01:33:31.765
"He presented a threat.

01:33:31.900 --> 01:33:34.069
He raised his weapon."

01:33:38.106 --> 01:33:41.010
"No, he fucking didn't, sir."

01:33:45.117 --> 01:33:49.084
I shouted in his face,
"No, he fucking didn't."

01:33:55.830 --> 01:33:58.093
(voice shaking):
"His arms were shredded."

01:34:03.638 --> 01:34:05.403
(crying):
I said, "I want to get out."

01:34:05.539 --> 01:34:07.136
He-he said, "You can't."

01:34:07.272 --> 01:34:10.138
He said, "Pull yourself
together and don't be thick.

01:34:10.273 --> 01:34:12.301
"Take a couple of days,
see the head doctor,

01:34:12.437 --> 01:34:14.975
"you'll be right as rain.

01:34:15.110 --> 01:34:17.341
We'll make this go away." So...

01:34:17.477 --> 01:34:19.781
I'm stood in front...
front of him,

01:34:19.917 --> 01:34:21.620
hot tears squirting out of me.

01:34:21.756 --> 01:34:23.587
If you'd asked me
what my name were,

01:34:23.722 --> 01:34:25.322
I wouldn't have known.

01:34:25.457 --> 01:34:27.485
(sobbing)

01:34:30.758 --> 01:34:32.794
So I...

01:34:32.929 --> 01:34:35.692
I took a couple of days, but...

01:34:35.827 --> 01:34:37.870
it-it weren't that long
for the shrink to see

01:34:38.006 --> 01:34:42.706
there were a crack in the ice
that wouldn't heal over.

01:34:42.841 --> 01:34:44.542
I were...
I were, as he put it...

01:34:44.678 --> 01:34:47.681
-Hey.
-...an unstable element.

01:34:49.016 --> 01:34:51.880
Danger to myself and others,
which, in our line of work,

01:34:52.015 --> 01:34:53.581
meant generally bad
for business.

01:34:53.716 --> 01:34:55.049
Time to go home.

01:34:55.185 --> 01:34:58.825
So he declared me unfit,
"return to unit."

01:34:58.960 --> 01:35:02.058
Signed me out, put me
on a plane back to my regiment.

01:35:03.796 --> 01:35:05.524
Short while later,
I find myself

01:35:05.660 --> 01:35:08.728
on the streets of Sheffield,
staring at my old front door.

01:35:08.863 --> 01:35:10.695
A civilian...

01:35:10.831 --> 01:35:12.530
and a...

01:35:15.535 --> 01:35:20.208
...a dirty little s-secret
war criminal.

01:35:21.807 --> 01:35:25.415
Yeah, well, I were coming up
15 years' service,

01:35:25.550 --> 01:35:27.347
due out anyway.

01:35:28.618 --> 01:35:30.383
(sighs)

01:35:36.696 --> 01:35:39.059
Could you have saved him?

01:35:39.195 --> 01:35:42.601
I did save him, Jem.
I did save him.

01:35:42.736 --> 01:35:45.236
Saved him from
more fucking pain.

01:35:45.371 --> 01:35:47.970
I'd have enjoyed watching him
suffer a little bit longer,

01:35:48.106 --> 01:35:50.744
so I did save him--
saved him from that.

01:35:55.879 --> 01:35:57.707
Why did you shoot him?

01:35:59.048 --> 01:36:01.249
Could we have kept him alive?

01:36:05.060 --> 01:36:07.852
(sniffles) At the t-time,
I knew we couldn't.

01:36:07.988 --> 01:36:09.862
At the time.

01:36:12.192 --> 01:36:14.067
