SENGOKU WEEKLY

00:00:10.014 --> 00:00:11.616
Hello, Sengoku Weekly.

00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:13.885
I have a scoop.

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:17.555
What kind of scoop?

00:00:18.790 --> 00:00:21.793
I saw a cat holding a human hand
in its mouth.

00:00:21.860 --> 00:00:22.760
A human hand?

00:00:23.328 --> 00:00:27.532
I thought a tabloid might take action
on something like this.

00:00:28.299 --> 00:00:33.872
Shinoda, you gotta be fed up
with people trying to trick you.

00:00:39.144 --> 00:00:41.179
Could you tell me more?

00:00:42.413 --> 00:00:44.916
How much do you pay for information?

00:00:44.983 --> 00:00:49.354
We can discuss that after I determine
if this is a potential article.

00:00:50.288 --> 00:00:51.689
Where did it happen?

00:00:52.357 --> 00:00:58.163
It happened at an old residential area
north of the Umegaya shopping arcade.

00:00:58.229 --> 00:01:00.064
The building is now abandoned,

00:01:00.131 --> 00:01:02.901
but unfortunately
I don't know the exact address.

00:01:02.967 --> 00:01:04.636
Is it next to a baker's shop?

00:01:04.702 --> 00:01:05.537
Yes!

00:01:06.137 --> 00:01:07.739
One moment, please.

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:10.208
By the way,

00:01:10.275 --> 00:01:14.812
is it possible the cat had a piece
of bread in its mouth, not an arm?

00:01:14.879 --> 00:01:15.914
Huh?!

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:18.416
Oh! It's not that I doubt you.

00:01:18.483 --> 00:01:20.218
It was no bread!

00:01:20.285 --> 00:01:21.619
I know what I saw!

00:01:21.686 --> 00:01:22.954
When did you see it?

00:01:23.021 --> 00:01:26.224
Just now!
It should still be in the area.

00:01:26.291 --> 00:01:28.993
Tell me the details
from when you saw it.

00:01:31.029 --> 00:01:33.698
There's a thin cinderblock wall
in the back,

00:01:33.765 --> 00:01:37.635
and the cat was slowly walking on it
from the right to the left.

00:01:38.269 --> 00:01:40.805
And the cat had the hand in its mouth.

00:01:40.872 --> 00:01:43.208
How could you tell
it was a human hand?

00:01:43.274 --> 00:01:44.609
There was a ring.

00:01:45.276 --> 00:01:46.811
Could it have been a doll?

00:01:46.878 --> 00:01:49.147
It was unmistakably a human hand.

00:01:50.215 --> 00:01:52.016
How can you be so certain?

00:01:53.051 --> 00:01:57.388
It was red and dirty where it was severed.

00:01:58.423 --> 00:01:59.557
What's up?

00:01:59.624 --> 00:02:02.627
It also smelled awful, so I'm sure of it!

00:02:04.262 --> 00:02:07.966
The cat was walking on the wall, right?

00:02:09.701 --> 00:02:14.038
I'm impressed you even noticed
the cat from so far away.

00:02:14.973 --> 00:02:18.977
Well, I heard it cry.

00:02:21.346 --> 00:02:23.081
So, um…

00:02:25.049 --> 00:02:28.553
You said you were on the road,
and saw the ring.

00:02:29.487 --> 00:02:33.124
Which means the back of the hand itself
was facing the road.

00:02:33.191 --> 00:02:36.427
Meaning the cut should've been
on the opposite side.

00:02:36.494 --> 00:02:38.596
So how could you tell it was red?

00:02:38.663 --> 00:02:40.898
Did the cat make a U-turn
on the thin wall?

00:02:40.965 --> 00:02:45.603
And if it cried out, it would've
had to put the hand down first.

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:47.905
So where did it drop it?

00:02:50.508 --> 00:02:51.476
She hung up.

00:02:52.143 --> 00:02:53.177
Sounds like a scam.

00:02:53.778 --> 00:02:55.146
Probably after money.

00:02:55.213 --> 00:02:58.583
There are people like that,
so stay vigilant.

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:03.721
Another dead end.

00:03:09.894 --> 00:03:11.062
Ms. Shinoda.

00:03:11.129 --> 00:03:11.963
Yes?

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:13.197
Are you free?

00:03:15.366 --> 00:03:17.268
I need a high school girl.

00:03:19.537 --> 00:03:20.371
Say what?

00:03:37.789 --> 00:03:38.956
Sorry I took a while.

00:03:39.557 --> 00:03:40.858
Sorry about this.

00:03:42.026 --> 00:03:44.662
I wonder if you remember this story.

00:03:45.396 --> 00:03:49.534
A woman who died from an unexpected
accident in a Shinagawa park last month.

00:03:50.601 --> 00:03:52.103
I vaguely remember.

00:03:52.170 --> 00:03:55.039
Well, we found a picture of the victim

00:03:55.106 --> 00:03:57.675
with a high school girl.

00:03:59.477 --> 00:04:03.915
We tried to meet this girl to talk to her,

00:04:03.981 --> 00:04:06.317
but somehow, she's gone missing.

00:04:07.185 --> 00:04:09.053
Her name is Madoka Hashimoto.

00:04:09.620 --> 00:04:11.889
We basically have no leads.

00:04:11.956 --> 00:04:16.260
All we know is she had a part-time
job for a few months since last fall.

00:04:17.328 --> 00:04:22.367
It's some clothing store by the station
that's popular with young women.

00:04:22.433 --> 00:04:26.204
It'd be really helpful if you could
pin down which shop.

00:04:29.474 --> 00:04:35.012
I'd like you to approach them
by saying her mother asked you

00:04:35.079 --> 00:04:37.548
to look for your missing classmate.

00:04:38.116 --> 00:04:40.385
You could pass for a high school kid.

00:04:41.152 --> 00:04:43.287
Just replace your shoes and bag.

00:04:43.354 --> 00:04:45.923
So go ahead,
you'll be reimbursed for them.

00:04:47.725 --> 00:04:48.693
Right now?

00:04:48.760 --> 00:04:49.627
Yes.

00:04:49.694 --> 00:04:52.764
Madoka Hashimoto was
part of the Movie Club,

00:04:52.830 --> 00:04:55.566
and she was cheerful and outgoing,
with average grades.

00:04:56.167 --> 00:04:58.970
You can show this picture if necessary,

00:04:59.036 --> 00:05:00.738
but don't offer your card.

00:05:02.306 --> 00:05:03.474
Good luck.

00:05:05.276 --> 00:05:06.210
Wait!

00:05:07.412 --> 00:05:09.347
So I find her workplace,

00:05:10.281 --> 00:05:11.249
then what?

00:05:12.216 --> 00:05:17.355
If you figure out her workplace,
we might find out where she currently is.

00:05:17.955 --> 00:05:19.424
Okay, you've got this.

00:05:19.957 --> 00:05:21.125
Hold on!

00:05:23.261 --> 00:05:25.129
What do I wear?

00:05:25.696 --> 00:05:28.900
Something fit for
a high-school girl, right?

00:05:28.966 --> 00:05:30.735
Why are you asking me?

00:05:30.802 --> 00:05:34.806
Anyway, you'll be fine as long as
you don't look like an office worker.

00:05:35.606 --> 00:05:36.441
Sorry.

00:05:36.507 --> 00:05:38.876
I'm supposed to meet someone now.

00:05:38.943 --> 00:05:39.944
Good luck.

00:05:49.053 --> 00:05:52.857
You're right, she's the only one
who could take on this mission.

00:05:55.359 --> 00:05:56.894
But she's late.

00:05:56.961 --> 00:05:58.796
Has she messaged you?

00:06:01.899 --> 00:06:03.534
MS. SHINODA
THIS FEELS CRINGE

00:06:04.101 --> 00:06:06.337
Nope, nothing.

00:06:07.038 --> 00:06:08.039
Yeah?

00:06:09.006 --> 00:06:11.576
I'm worried she might be panicking.

00:06:22.019 --> 00:06:25.022
DID SOMETHING HAPPEN?

00:06:25.857 --> 00:06:26.991
Mr. Murai!

00:06:29.327 --> 00:06:30.394
I'm back.

00:06:30.461 --> 00:06:31.462
Good job.

00:06:31.529 --> 00:06:32.530
Were you okay?

00:06:32.597 --> 00:06:35.766
I didn't have time to change
before coming back.

00:06:35.833 --> 00:06:39.670
Let's meet up in the conference
room for a debriefing at 18:00.

00:06:39.737 --> 00:06:41.105
Let Akutsu know, too.

00:06:43.007 --> 00:06:43.841
Excuse me.

00:06:45.676 --> 00:06:47.044
Can I get a comment?

00:06:50.081 --> 00:06:50.982
Good work.

00:06:53.651 --> 00:06:55.086
SENGOKU WEEKLY

00:06:55.152 --> 00:06:55.987
Really?

00:07:05.897 --> 00:07:07.431
Your fit is on point today.

00:07:07.498 --> 00:07:08.533
Like that, right?

00:07:08.599 --> 00:07:10.268
Even if you say it as a joke…

00:07:10.334 --> 00:07:12.236
No, I'm quite serious!

00:07:12.303 --> 00:07:13.638
Also, what was that message?

00:07:14.338 --> 00:07:16.641
Sorry, I sent that to you by mistake.

00:07:16.707 --> 00:07:20.111
I thought I sent that to Asuka,
a coworker in sales.

00:07:20.177 --> 00:07:21.212
I see.

00:07:21.946 --> 00:07:23.848
Canvassing is tough.

00:07:24.549 --> 00:07:26.317
How did you do it?

00:07:27.585 --> 00:07:29.754
Well.

00:07:31.055 --> 00:07:33.558
There were so many shops.

00:07:33.624 --> 00:07:38.162
I just basically repeatedly approached
the staff who were on the floor.

00:07:38.930 --> 00:07:41.732
I asked if Madoka Hashimoto
ever worked there.

00:07:41.799 --> 00:07:44.702
Then I mentioned that Madoka
hasn't been home lately.

00:07:44.769 --> 00:07:46.771
Those were my talking points.

00:07:47.738 --> 00:07:50.041
The first shop was a bust,

00:07:50.107 --> 00:07:55.212
but I felt some relief when I realized
I just had to repeat these two steps.

00:07:56.113 --> 00:07:59.350
But then the second shop
was really uncooperative.

00:08:00.685 --> 00:08:04.422
And when I told the third
that her mother asked me to do this,

00:08:04.488 --> 00:08:06.490
they asked me if that was true.

00:08:06.991 --> 00:08:10.027
I panicked so hard,
I thought my heart would burst.

00:08:10.094 --> 00:08:11.562
What gave it away?

00:08:12.363 --> 00:08:15.266
It seems she didn't get along
with her mother.

00:08:15.933 --> 00:08:18.970
So they doubted a mother like that
would ask me to help.

00:08:19.804 --> 00:08:21.138
That makes sense.

00:08:22.840 --> 00:08:24.342
We should go.

00:08:25.443 --> 00:08:26.277
Yeah.

00:08:28.412 --> 00:08:30.381
After hearing that,

00:08:32.583 --> 00:08:36.787
I asked the worker how they knew that.

00:08:38.089 --> 00:08:39.223
Good point.

00:08:41.792 --> 00:08:43.327
According to this coworker,

00:08:43.394 --> 00:08:46.430
Ms. Hashimoto worked there
from last fall to the new year,

00:08:46.497 --> 00:08:49.500
hiding that she was still in high school.

00:08:49.567 --> 00:08:52.903
They often had their breaks together,

00:08:52.970 --> 00:08:57.575
and Hashimoto did mention a boy,
but the staff didn't remember the details.

00:08:57.642 --> 00:09:01.579
Hashimoto also wanted to model,
and considered auditioning.

00:09:01.646 --> 00:09:05.216
She told the coworker about
attending a seminar in that field.

00:09:05.282 --> 00:09:06.851
That's all I've got.

00:09:07.585 --> 00:09:10.921
Sounds like great work!

00:09:10.988 --> 00:09:13.124
Good job. This doesn't always work out.

00:09:13.858 --> 00:09:16.427
Even without results,
this legwork is important.

00:09:16.994 --> 00:09:22.099
Tabloids are made up from an accumulation
of misses and dead ends.

00:09:23.267 --> 00:09:25.169
We're finished if we neglect that.

00:09:25.803 --> 00:09:27.238
Never forget that.

00:09:27.304 --> 00:09:28.806
Anyway, great work.

00:09:31.342 --> 00:09:32.209
Excuse me.

00:09:33.444 --> 00:09:35.946
What do you mean by "finished"?

00:09:37.014 --> 00:09:38.215
Our article quality.

00:09:39.083 --> 00:09:40.518
The amount of work put in.

00:09:41.252 --> 00:09:44.822
Every small detail
depends on the care we put in it.

00:09:46.057 --> 00:09:48.492
If we cut corners, our quality dips.

00:09:48.559 --> 00:09:50.594
If our quality dips, we lose trust.

00:09:50.661 --> 00:09:52.096
If a tabloid loses trust,

00:09:53.030 --> 00:09:54.465
it's finished.

00:09:56.467 --> 00:09:58.069
You'll get it eventually.

00:09:59.937 --> 00:10:01.205
Anyway, good work.

00:10:07.645 --> 00:10:08.813
Good work today.

00:10:13.884 --> 00:10:16.153
Shinoda, you can pull off disguises.

00:10:16.220 --> 00:10:17.088
What?

00:10:18.189 --> 00:10:19.390
Is it working?

00:10:21.459 --> 00:10:23.594
I could use your help on something.

00:10:26.197 --> 00:10:27.131
But before that,

00:10:27.765 --> 00:10:29.767
I want you to go to Niigata tomorrow.

00:10:30.968 --> 00:10:33.537
Here's a bullet train ticket.

00:10:34.138 --> 00:10:36.107
TOKYO TO NIIGATA

00:10:36.741 --> 00:10:38.642
What's the job?

00:10:43.814 --> 00:10:44.915
Let's talk over dinner.

00:10:53.758 --> 00:10:55.159
I hope she is safe.

00:10:55.926 --> 00:10:57.661
Just go home already.

00:10:58.529 --> 00:11:00.564
I'm praying nothing has happened,

00:11:01.198 --> 00:11:04.268
and that this picture
won't need to get published.

00:11:05.536 --> 00:11:06.570
Thanks for waiting.

00:11:07.505 --> 00:11:09.573
-I'm sure you're curious about the job.
-Yes.

00:11:14.011 --> 00:11:16.413
Kota Kubozuka, age 27.

00:11:18.516 --> 00:11:21.118
In his teenage years,
he caused an assault case.

00:11:21.852 --> 00:11:25.623
At the time, he was under the care
of a Mr. Kazuo Watanabe.

00:11:26.957 --> 00:11:29.760
They lived in Niigata City at the time,

00:11:29.827 --> 00:11:32.630
but Kubozuka moved to Tokyo with friends.

00:11:33.364 --> 00:11:38.269
Mr. Watanabe is currently
living in a home in Tokyo.

00:11:39.069 --> 00:11:41.639
But to be sure, I want to check
their Niigata residence.

00:11:42.640 --> 00:11:45.743
To check if Mr. Watanabe is there?

00:11:47.144 --> 00:11:50.080
Making sure he's not there
is part of the job.

00:11:52.049 --> 00:11:53.984
So this is an intel gathering mission.

00:11:55.853 --> 00:11:57.988
Make sure you ring the doorbell.

00:11:58.055 --> 00:11:59.156
Okay.

00:11:59.723 --> 00:12:01.859
And even if nobody answers,

00:12:01.926 --> 00:12:05.029
can you check
if the meters are running?

00:12:06.463 --> 00:12:10.100
And also walk a lap around the house.

00:12:10.167 --> 00:12:11.035
Understood.

00:12:11.101 --> 00:12:12.336
Thanks.

00:12:20.077 --> 00:12:22.780
The next morning, I went to Niigata

00:12:23.480 --> 00:12:26.183
with plans to come back within the day.

00:12:28.352 --> 00:12:29.753
But I got lost

00:12:29.820 --> 00:12:34.325
and now I'm in the home of a stranger
I interviewed this afternoon.

00:12:34.825 --> 00:12:38.762
I managed to make it
to Mr. Watanabe's house,

00:12:38.829 --> 00:12:43.234
but then I got lost on the way back.

00:12:43.300 --> 00:12:45.202
And then it got dark.

00:12:45.269 --> 00:12:48.138
And then my phone died,

00:12:48.205 --> 00:12:49.907
so I couldn't call anyone.

00:12:49.974 --> 00:12:51.909
And then it started raining hard.

00:12:51.976 --> 00:12:55.045
And then I saw a sign that said
beware of bears--

00:12:55.112 --> 00:12:56.380
Maybe come in?

00:12:56.447 --> 00:12:58.582
For now, you should come in.

00:12:59.283 --> 00:13:01.485
Here, dry yourself off.

00:13:01.552 --> 00:13:04.521
Come on, you'll catch a cold!

00:13:04.588 --> 00:13:06.290
Thank you, I'm sorry!

00:13:09.293 --> 00:13:12.296
I'm terribly sorry to ask,

00:13:13.097 --> 00:13:15.399
but could I charge my phone here?

00:13:15.466 --> 00:13:17.701
Are you going somewhere again?

00:13:19.336 --> 00:13:20.537
Back to Tokyo.

00:13:21.572 --> 00:13:24.208
You can't go back today!

00:13:24.275 --> 00:13:26.143
It'll be tomorrow, most likely.

00:13:27.077 --> 00:13:28.812
Stay the night here.

00:13:28.879 --> 00:13:30.247
We have a spare room.

00:13:30.314 --> 00:13:32.683
Take a bath, get a good night's sleep,

00:13:32.750 --> 00:13:34.551
and then go home tomorrow, okay?

00:13:42.259 --> 00:13:43.694
Thank you very much!

00:13:58.142 --> 00:13:59.076
Ms. Shinoda?

00:13:59.143 --> 00:13:59.977
Yes?

00:14:00.044 --> 00:14:01.946
How's the water? Not too hot?

00:14:02.012 --> 00:14:03.180
It's perfect.

00:14:03.247 --> 00:14:04.481
Thank you.

00:14:04.548 --> 00:14:06.050
That's good to hear.

00:14:06.116 --> 00:14:07.084
Enjoy.

00:14:07.151 --> 00:14:08.686
Thank you.

00:14:11.555 --> 00:14:13.524
In the mountains of Niigata,

00:14:13.590 --> 00:14:16.160
I encountered human warmth
I had not felt in a while.

00:14:17.294 --> 00:14:20.898
But what am I even doing?

00:14:22.566 --> 00:14:26.203
I didn't join a publisher
to do stuff like this.

00:14:41.085 --> 00:14:43.454
Are my daughter's pajamas too big?

00:14:43.520 --> 00:14:44.355
Not at all.

00:14:44.922 --> 00:14:45.856
It's perfect.

00:14:45.923 --> 00:14:46.991
Thank you.

00:14:48.392 --> 00:14:50.227
Is Sengokusha that publisher?

00:14:51.729 --> 00:14:52.563
Yes.

00:14:53.263 --> 00:14:54.298
I read it sometimes.

00:14:56.834 --> 00:14:58.535
Let's see…

00:14:59.837 --> 00:15:00.871
Here.

00:15:00.938 --> 00:15:03.874
That's the Weekly Truth
from our rival company.

00:15:05.376 --> 00:15:06.410
This isn't it?

00:15:08.312 --> 00:15:10.214
But Sengokusha is well-known.

00:15:11.648 --> 00:15:13.751
-I'll help.
-Don't be silly.

00:15:13.817 --> 00:15:15.052
Sit down.

00:15:17.221 --> 00:15:20.858
But I assumed if it's a tabloid,

00:15:21.825 --> 00:15:24.261
the reporters would be more experienced.

00:15:25.129 --> 00:15:26.263
You're a full-time employee?

00:15:26.330 --> 00:15:27.164
Yes.

00:15:27.231 --> 00:15:29.400
I joined last spring after graduating.

00:15:30.300 --> 00:15:33.337
They sent a girl
in her second year on the job

00:15:33.404 --> 00:15:35.773
to a place this remote by herself?

00:15:35.839 --> 00:15:38.776
Even if it's just research,
that's so dangerous.

00:15:39.843 --> 00:15:43.147
It's not really research.
More like, gathering intel.

00:15:44.314 --> 00:15:46.817
Watanabe wasn't there, was he?

00:15:47.751 --> 00:15:48.652
No.

00:15:49.887 --> 00:15:54.491
I think he moved to a group home
in Tokyo two years ago.

00:15:55.826 --> 00:15:57.294
He lived alone,

00:15:58.095 --> 00:16:01.832
so his house has been empty
for a while.

00:16:02.633 --> 00:16:04.601
I knew that coming in.

00:16:04.668 --> 00:16:07.771
You knew it
and they still sent you anyway?

00:16:07.838 --> 00:16:11.442
Checking to make sure
he wasn't here is part of the job.

00:16:11.508 --> 00:16:13.710
You're impressive for someone so young.

00:16:14.945 --> 00:16:17.147
Do you visit home often?

00:16:17.214 --> 00:16:19.483
I'm sure your folks worry.

00:16:20.117 --> 00:16:23.587
My parents don't know I've transferred
to the Incident Team,

00:16:24.221 --> 00:16:26.590
they think I'm still editing the PR zine.

00:16:26.657 --> 00:16:29.593
I'm sure they'd love a call from you.

00:16:30.761 --> 00:16:32.062
Can you drink?

00:16:32.629 --> 00:16:34.631
I'm still on the clock.

00:16:35.232 --> 00:16:36.066
Sorry.

00:16:36.133 --> 00:16:37.734
Do you usually drink?

00:16:37.801 --> 00:16:39.903
Yes, I do. A bit.

00:16:40.871 --> 00:16:43.340
What'll happen if you get drunk?

00:16:43.407 --> 00:16:44.875
Don't ask her that!

00:16:44.942 --> 00:16:47.144
-I'm so sorry.
-It's okay.

00:16:47.211 --> 00:16:49.480
Why don't you come sit here?

00:16:50.080 --> 00:16:50.981
Thank you.

00:16:54.051 --> 00:16:57.821
I go drinking a lot
with my friend in sales.

00:16:57.888 --> 00:17:00.824
And she says I don't change at all.

00:17:00.891 --> 00:17:01.892
Really?

00:17:04.795 --> 00:17:08.198
You hear me, stupid Sengokusha!

00:17:08.265 --> 00:17:09.500
Cut it out.

00:17:10.367 --> 00:17:11.335
I'm so done.

00:17:11.401 --> 00:17:12.269
I'm going to quit!

00:17:12.336 --> 00:17:14.872
Keep your voice down, it's embarrassing.

00:17:14.938 --> 00:17:15.806
ASUKA MEGURO

00:17:15.873 --> 00:17:17.641
Who cares, nobody's listening!

00:17:17.708 --> 00:17:19.243
The bartender's here.

00:17:22.546 --> 00:17:24.014
How much did I tell you?

00:17:25.382 --> 00:17:26.650
I went to Niigata--

00:17:26.717 --> 00:17:29.153
That's enough. Let's just go home.

00:17:29.219 --> 00:17:33.857
I rang the doorbell in the rain.

00:17:33.924 --> 00:17:35.526
You said that already.

00:17:35.592 --> 00:17:37.327
They let you spend the night.

00:17:37.394 --> 00:17:38.162
Yeah.

00:17:38.695 --> 00:17:39.763
That's it.

00:17:39.830 --> 00:17:41.999
You gotta listen to what happened!

00:17:42.065 --> 00:17:43.167
I'm listening!

00:17:43.934 --> 00:17:45.369
And then--

00:17:48.772 --> 00:17:50.574
I woke up in the morning,

00:17:50.641 --> 00:17:53.043
and helped with the laundry.

00:17:53.110 --> 00:17:55.546
Then they fed me again.

00:17:56.480 --> 00:17:59.449
Then they drove me to the station,

00:18:00.717 --> 00:18:03.320
and I couldn't thank them enough.

00:18:04.721 --> 00:18:08.325
I didn't think they'd ever
accept any money from me,

00:18:09.193 --> 00:18:13.497
so I left some money and a letter
on my bedding.

00:18:13.564 --> 00:18:14.464
THANK YOU FOR YOUR HELP

00:18:14.531 --> 00:18:17.634
I think the wife will find it.

00:18:21.605 --> 00:18:23.340
I'm surprised you had letter paper.

00:18:26.910 --> 00:18:28.545
I always do.

00:18:29.613 --> 00:18:31.915
So you really are
doing your best at work.

00:18:31.982 --> 00:18:34.851
Yes, exactly, I'm trying so hard!

00:18:34.918 --> 00:18:36.119
You're being relied on.

00:18:37.287 --> 00:18:40.824
But if they ever ask me
to do some weird job again,

00:18:40.891 --> 00:18:43.460
I'm definitely turning it down.

00:18:44.595 --> 00:18:46.163
Will you though?

00:18:46.730 --> 00:18:47.965
Can you?

00:18:49.099 --> 00:18:51.835
I bet you're secretly feeling fulfilled.

00:18:55.439 --> 00:18:56.573
Give me another!

00:19:07.150 --> 00:19:08.986
MULTIPLE SUSPICIOUS DEATHS

00:19:13.790 --> 00:19:16.193
HARUE KOMIYAMA

00:19:16.260 --> 00:19:17.894
MADOKA HASHIMOTO

00:19:23.166 --> 00:19:25.636
KOTA KUBOZUKA - FUGITIVE

00:19:46.356 --> 00:19:48.425
You've reached Sengoku Weekly.

00:19:49.393 --> 00:19:50.961
TO BE CONTINUED

00:19:51.528 --> 00:19:53.063
We might catch them sleeping over.

00:19:53.130 --> 00:19:56.667
An outfit to trick an up-and-coming
influencer and the Blue Ranger.

00:19:56.733 --> 00:19:58.602
This apartment is our target's home.

00:19:58.669 --> 00:20:00.337
You make a living on others' misery.

00:20:00.404 --> 00:20:03.540
I thought I was
a stronger person than this.

00:20:04.041 --> 00:20:06.943
