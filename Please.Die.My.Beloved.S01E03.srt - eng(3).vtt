WEBVTT

00:00:03.336 --> 00:00:06.473
I'll never forgive him
for cheating on me.

00:00:06.639 --> 00:00:10.610
You should still get things ready,
like proof of the affair.

00:00:10.677 --> 00:00:13.847
The perfume
that was on those blankets...

00:00:14.047 --> 00:00:15.048
Who was it?

00:00:16.783 --> 00:00:18.818
Riko? Why?

00:00:19.352 --> 00:00:22.322
Mitsuhiro was cheating on me
with Riko.

00:00:50.784 --> 00:00:51.785
What?

00:00:52.118 --> 00:00:54.120
- Oh, excuse me.
- I'm sorry.

00:00:56.556 --> 00:00:57.590
I'm sorry.

00:00:59.759 --> 00:01:00.760
I'll do it.

00:01:01.594 --> 00:01:03.596
Do this, and then...

00:01:04.731 --> 00:01:07.333
What? It's even more tangled up now.

00:01:10.603 --> 00:01:11.604
Should we just

00:01:12.439 --> 00:01:14.107
head into work together?

00:01:21.881 --> 00:01:23.116
It was love at first sight

00:01:23.716 --> 00:01:24.717
for both of us.

00:01:43.269 --> 00:01:44.804
I didn't waver at all.

00:01:45.438 --> 00:01:50.009
I was certain that this fateful,
passionate encounter was love.

00:01:52.112 --> 00:01:54.581
I decided to marry Hiroki.

00:01:55.148 --> 00:01:56.149
- What?!
- What?!

00:01:56.683 --> 00:01:58.284
Wait, marriage?

00:01:58.751 --> 00:02:01.087
You only dated
for three months, right?

00:02:01.154 --> 00:02:02.622
- Yes.
- Are you sure?

00:02:02.689 --> 00:02:04.824
Yes, I'm totally sure.

00:02:05.225 --> 00:02:06.626
I just know it.

00:02:07.794 --> 00:02:08.795
I see.

00:02:09.362 --> 00:02:10.964
If you say so, it must be true.

00:02:11.331 --> 00:02:13.133
Yes, this is Riko
we're talking about.

00:02:13.967 --> 00:02:15.368
- Congratulations.
- Congratulations.

00:02:15.435 --> 00:02:16.436
Thank you.

00:02:18.471 --> 00:02:22.709
I believed in the happiness
his eternal love would bring.

00:02:30.416 --> 00:02:31.417
BEATS PER MINUTE

00:02:31.484 --> 00:02:33.786
Heart rate rising.

00:02:33.853 --> 00:02:35.955
BEATS PER MINUTE

00:02:48.701 --> 00:02:50.703
Why are you keeping secrets?

00:02:51.137 --> 00:02:52.605
Aren't we married?

00:02:53.006 --> 00:02:55.975
Secrets? I don't have
to tell you everything.

00:02:56.042 --> 00:02:58.278
That's so messed up!

00:02:58.344 --> 00:02:59.979
You're the one who's messed up.

00:03:01.181 --> 00:03:02.182
How?

00:03:02.482 --> 00:03:03.983
How can you say that?

00:03:04.050 --> 00:03:05.685
I'm just giving you my love.

00:03:06.019 --> 00:03:07.020
You...

00:03:08.454 --> 00:03:09.789
love me too, right?

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:14.160
Heart rate has reached
160 beats per minute.

00:03:14.227 --> 00:03:15.261
Riko!

00:03:15.495 --> 00:03:18.364
His love became warped

00:03:19.098 --> 00:03:21.034
and shackled me down.

00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:25.471
Riko!

00:03:37.116 --> 00:03:39.986
Heart rate has reached
170 beats per minute.

00:03:40.320 --> 00:03:43.122
I can't anymore. Please die.

00:05:05.438 --> 00:05:08.408
PLEASE DIE MY BELOVED

00:05:09.208 --> 00:05:10.209
Riko.

00:05:11.144 --> 00:05:12.145
Riko?

00:05:13.079 --> 00:05:14.514
Are you okay, Riko?

00:05:15.515 --> 00:05:16.516
Riko!

00:05:17.950 --> 00:05:19.385
- Riko.
- Maya.

00:05:19.619 --> 00:05:20.620
What happened?

00:05:21.421 --> 00:05:23.222
Riko, wait!

00:05:23.289 --> 00:05:25.158
Riko...

00:05:27.093 --> 00:05:28.094
Maya.

00:05:30.096 --> 00:05:31.097
Good evening.

00:05:38.338 --> 00:05:39.839
Hey, are you okay?

00:05:40.573 --> 00:05:41.574
What happened?

00:05:44.744 --> 00:05:49.082
Well, why are you dropping by
at this hour, Maya?

00:05:54.721 --> 00:05:55.888
Well, Riko...

00:06:00.226 --> 00:06:01.227
Are you...

00:06:02.695 --> 00:06:03.863
hiding something from me?

00:06:04.697 --> 00:06:05.698
What?

00:06:08.134 --> 00:06:09.135
For example

00:06:10.536 --> 00:06:11.537
an affair.

00:06:22.181 --> 00:06:23.649
You're having one, aren't you?

00:06:24.283 --> 00:06:25.284
How did you know?

00:06:34.227 --> 00:06:35.228
This.

00:06:36.062 --> 00:06:38.097
Mitsuhiro sent it to me.

00:06:41.701 --> 00:06:43.603
- What?
- He's your affair, right?

00:06:44.404 --> 00:06:45.938
And Hiroki found out.

00:06:46.272 --> 00:06:48.875
No, why would I sleep with Mitsuhiro?

00:06:49.108 --> 00:06:50.643
There's no way.

00:06:51.043 --> 00:06:52.044
You didn't?

00:06:52.812 --> 00:06:55.448
No, give me a break.

00:06:55.515 --> 00:06:57.517
I'd never do anything
with your husband.

00:06:58.251 --> 00:06:59.519
Then what is this photo?

00:07:00.019 --> 00:07:01.254
You two met up, right?

00:07:02.889 --> 00:07:03.890
We did.

00:07:04.757 --> 00:07:05.958
It was a coincidence.

00:07:07.427 --> 00:07:09.128
- A coincidence?
- Yes.

00:07:12.198 --> 00:07:15.301
- When? Where?
- You're asking when?

00:07:16.102 --> 00:07:19.005
Before he disappeared, of course.

00:07:20.873 --> 00:07:26.379
I think it was on a Saturday
at the end of last month.

00:07:27.079 --> 00:07:28.314
I was out shopping

00:07:28.815 --> 00:07:31.184
and ran into Mitsuhiro.

00:07:32.785 --> 00:07:33.786
Riko?

00:07:36.155 --> 00:07:37.423
Mitsuhiro?

00:07:37.890 --> 00:07:39.292
It's been a while.

00:07:39.559 --> 00:07:41.627
- What a coincidence.
- Yes.

00:07:41.761 --> 00:07:45.164
- Thank you for watching over Maya.
- No, likewise.

00:07:45.498 --> 00:07:47.900
I actually invited her today.

00:07:47.967 --> 00:07:49.335
But she had work.

00:07:49.569 --> 00:07:52.238
Oh, yes, seems like it.

00:07:56.576 --> 00:07:58.444
Can we take a photo?

00:07:59.412 --> 00:08:02.882
You know, to surprise Maya
since we ran into each other.

00:08:05.051 --> 00:08:06.052
How about here?

00:08:06.919 --> 00:08:08.821
- Sure.
- One moment.

00:08:09.989 --> 00:08:11.390
Here goes.

00:08:14.560 --> 00:08:17.296
You look stiff. Can we try again?

00:08:17.363 --> 00:08:18.364
Okay.

00:08:21.267 --> 00:08:22.301
Here goes.

00:08:30.009 --> 00:08:31.010
Really?

00:08:32.178 --> 00:08:33.513
I'm telling the truth!

00:08:33.980 --> 00:08:34.981
Oh, right.

00:08:35.281 --> 00:08:38.217
And Mitsuhiro sent the photo
right then and there.

00:08:38.851 --> 00:08:42.121
So I thought
he was sending it to you.

00:08:44.924 --> 00:08:45.925
It wasn't me.

00:08:46.459 --> 00:08:47.460
Then...

00:08:49.662 --> 00:08:51.230
That's odd.

00:08:53.699 --> 00:08:54.700
That...

00:08:56.035 --> 00:08:57.537
doesn't sound like him.

00:09:02.074 --> 00:09:03.943
Well, that's what happened.

00:09:04.143 --> 00:09:05.711
I didn't sleep with him.

00:09:06.979 --> 00:09:07.980
Believe me.

00:09:12.652 --> 00:09:14.820
Okay, I believe you.

00:09:20.493 --> 00:09:21.827
Thank God.

00:09:22.895 --> 00:09:25.197
I'm sorry for suspecting you.

00:09:25.598 --> 00:09:26.599
It's fine.

00:09:30.903 --> 00:09:34.740
Wait, then who was your affair with?

00:09:37.677 --> 00:09:42.014
I'll talk about it next time
when Yurika is with us.

00:09:45.518 --> 00:09:46.519
Okay.

00:09:57.330 --> 00:09:58.397
Why...

00:10:00.533 --> 00:10:02.435
did Mitsuhiro send that photo?

00:10:14.580 --> 00:10:15.581
Welcome home.

00:10:17.316 --> 00:10:20.019
It's so late,
I was about to go get you.

00:10:21.220 --> 00:10:22.221
I'm sorry.

00:10:23.756 --> 00:10:25.091
I was surprised

00:10:25.891 --> 00:10:28.094
that she texted you
about going to the police.

00:10:28.160 --> 00:10:29.161
Maya, I went to the police.

00:10:29.228 --> 00:10:30.696
Yurika, Good work.
Tell us about it later, okay?

00:10:32.164 --> 00:10:34.233
Maya's husband went missing.

00:10:34.700 --> 00:10:35.901
That's important.

00:10:36.902 --> 00:10:38.537
You should've told me.

00:10:47.013 --> 00:10:48.014
Well, then.

00:10:48.748 --> 00:10:50.683
Tell me all about what Maya said.

00:10:53.619 --> 00:10:54.620
Okay?

00:10:56.922 --> 00:10:58.424
Hurry over.

00:11:26.719 --> 00:11:29.121
- Well?
- Okay, I just had tea.

00:11:29.321 --> 00:11:31.123
What flavor was it?

00:11:31.290 --> 00:11:33.392
- What flavor?
- Try guessing, Yuna.

00:11:34.293 --> 00:11:35.294
Go ahead.

00:11:35.728 --> 00:11:38.197
That's right!

00:11:38.297 --> 00:11:39.565
Correct!

00:11:58.350 --> 00:11:59.351
Mom.

00:12:00.686 --> 00:12:01.687
Mom?

00:12:02.788 --> 00:12:03.789
Mom!

00:12:05.658 --> 00:12:08.094
I can't find my teddy handkerchief.

00:12:08.160 --> 00:12:09.161
What?

00:12:09.228 --> 00:12:11.497
Dear, where's the teddy handkerchief?

00:12:11.564 --> 00:12:13.165
I'm sorry, on the sofa.

00:12:13.599 --> 00:12:15.334
You're kidding me!

00:12:15.401 --> 00:12:17.303
If you don't fold it,
it gets wrinkled.

00:12:17.369 --> 00:12:19.071
I was going to do it later.

00:12:19.138 --> 00:12:21.807
Hurry, it's almost time for school.

00:12:22.341 --> 00:12:23.909
- Wait, the photo.
- Right.

00:12:24.343 --> 00:12:25.344
Okay.

00:12:25.544 --> 00:12:27.646
- I hate wrinkles!
- I'm sorry.

00:12:27.913 --> 00:12:29.949
Yuna, I'm sorry.

00:12:30.015 --> 00:12:31.584
Can you use this for today?

00:12:31.650 --> 00:12:33.185
Bunnies are cute.

00:12:34.186 --> 00:12:35.788
You're so inefficient.

00:12:36.021 --> 00:12:37.123
I'm sorry.

00:12:38.157 --> 00:12:40.893
Yuna, let's get your jacket on.

00:12:41.994 --> 00:12:43.829
- Hurry, you're tiring me out
- I'm sorry.

00:12:43.896 --> 00:12:45.464
- and it's still morning.
- I'm sorry.

00:12:45.564 --> 00:12:47.099
There you go.

00:12:47.166 --> 00:12:48.901
Put on your shoes.

00:12:49.034 --> 00:12:50.970
Dear, what are you doing?

00:12:51.337 --> 00:12:53.839
- Hurry up already.
- I'm here.

00:12:54.006 --> 00:12:55.441
- All right, let's go. All right.
- Okay.

00:12:55.508 --> 00:12:56.509
Stay safe.

00:12:56.575 --> 00:12:58.177
- We're off.
- Have a good day.

00:13:03.282 --> 00:13:04.283
Oh, right.

00:13:05.618 --> 00:13:07.753
DAD'S HOMEMADE LUNCH

00:13:14.860 --> 00:13:17.296
It does stick out a bit.

00:13:17.363 --> 00:13:18.564
I agree.

00:13:18.631 --> 00:13:20.099
- Komoto, a word?
- Yes.

00:13:20.966 --> 00:13:23.969
The department chief
wants you to go to this

00:13:24.503 --> 00:13:26.205
as a voice for married women.

00:13:26.272 --> 00:13:27.406
ONLINE RECRUITMENT INTERVIEW,
DIVERSE CAREER PATHS FOR WOMEN

00:13:27.773 --> 00:13:28.874
Why me?

00:13:28.941 --> 00:13:30.543
Probably for balance.

00:13:30.976 --> 00:13:32.411
The others all have kids.

00:13:33.212 --> 00:13:34.246
Well, thank you again.

00:13:40.186 --> 00:13:43.389
He says problematic things
like it's second nature.

00:13:43.455 --> 00:13:47.960
Yes, I'm surprised he hasn't
been fired from his position.

00:13:49.361 --> 00:13:53.732
This company is the problem
for just looking at your age and sex.

00:13:54.333 --> 00:13:57.336
I think you're perfect for this.

00:13:58.604 --> 00:14:00.339
The interview.

00:14:00.506 --> 00:14:03.075
You have so many achievements
to brag about.

00:14:04.743 --> 00:14:05.978
You think so?

00:14:06.145 --> 00:14:07.246
You do.

00:14:07.313 --> 00:14:09.648
Show them everything you've got.

00:14:11.884 --> 00:14:12.885
Thank you.

00:14:16.455 --> 00:14:17.456
Let's see...

00:14:22.328 --> 00:14:24.363
- I'm sorry, I have to take this.
- Okay.

00:14:24.830 --> 00:14:26.131
Yes, hello?

00:14:26.665 --> 00:14:28.200
This is Kawada from Nitto Solutions.

00:14:28.434 --> 00:14:29.935
Komoto contacted us.

00:14:30.069 --> 00:14:31.370
What? Really?

00:14:32.338 --> 00:14:34.640
He hasn't talked to you, it seems?

00:14:35.341 --> 00:14:36.342
No.

00:14:37.710 --> 00:14:38.711
Well...

00:14:39.345 --> 00:14:40.913
What did he say?

00:14:41.347 --> 00:14:43.749
He emailed an apology
for his unauthorized absences

00:14:44.016 --> 00:14:46.752
and requested an extended leave.

00:14:48.287 --> 00:14:49.355
I see.

00:14:50.756 --> 00:14:52.524
We requested that he call us

00:14:52.591 --> 00:14:55.427
since we're worried
that he only sent an email.

00:14:56.328 --> 00:14:57.863
If he gets in contact

00:14:58.097 --> 00:14:59.798
we'll report back to you.

00:15:00.232 --> 00:15:01.233
Okay.

00:15:02.801 --> 00:15:03.802
Of course.

00:15:04.637 --> 00:15:05.838
Thank you.

00:15:10.042 --> 00:15:11.477
Mitsuhiro is alive.

00:15:13.779 --> 00:15:14.947
If only...

00:15:18.150 --> 00:15:20.185
If only you'd just die!

00:15:22.354 --> 00:15:23.956
Those words of mine

00:15:25.858 --> 00:15:27.993
didn't kill him.

00:15:32.665 --> 00:15:36.368
KAJIWARA POLICE DEPARTMENT

00:15:54.853 --> 00:15:57.489
Workplace.

00:15:58.324 --> 00:16:01.760
Anyway, I'm relieved
that my husband is still alive.

00:16:02.394 --> 00:16:04.863
No, we can't conclude anything yet.

00:16:07.700 --> 00:16:09.468
You didn't talk face-to-face, right?

00:16:11.370 --> 00:16:13.105
No, it was just an email.

00:16:13.706 --> 00:16:14.707
If it was an email

00:16:15.040 --> 00:16:17.109
it might be an impersonation.

00:16:17.810 --> 00:16:18.811
An impersonation?

00:16:21.547 --> 00:16:22.948
Who would do that?

00:16:24.550 --> 00:16:25.651
And why?

00:16:38.130 --> 00:16:40.632
No, I'm just saying
it's a possibility.

00:16:41.567 --> 00:16:46.872
Well, until you can confirm
by meeting or calling him

00:16:46.939 --> 00:16:50.275
I'll leave
the missing person report as is.

00:16:51.910 --> 00:16:52.911
Okay.

00:17:11.930 --> 00:17:12.931
An impersonation.

00:17:14.566 --> 00:17:19.104
Would a plain guy like him
get caught up in something like that?

00:17:39.558 --> 00:17:40.559
NOVEMBER 27, 2024

00:17:43.362 --> 00:17:45.130
DECEMBER 2024 BILLING STATEMENT,
MR. MITSUHIRO KOMOTO

00:17:50.669 --> 00:17:51.670
I've never seen this.

00:17:53.272 --> 00:17:54.273
Never seen this.

00:17:54.339 --> 00:17:55.441
HEALTH EXAM RESULTS

00:17:56.075 --> 00:18:00.579
We lived seven years together,
yet there's so much I don't know.

00:18:16.995 --> 00:18:18.030
Could it be?

00:18:19.298 --> 00:18:20.732
Is there a secret

00:18:22.167 --> 00:18:25.304
hiding behind
my husband's disappearance?

00:18:35.047 --> 00:18:36.415
Now, then.

00:18:37.249 --> 00:18:40.886
How is Riko doing today?

00:18:46.258 --> 00:18:48.927
You got a lot of emails.
You must have been busy.

00:18:54.733 --> 00:18:57.236
You're so tough on your editor.

00:18:57.302 --> 00:18:59.271
You shouldn't write stuff like this.

00:18:59.705 --> 00:19:00.706
I'm going to go change.

00:19:16.088 --> 00:19:20.092
Ryosuke,
We shouldn't meet for a while. Sorry.

00:19:29.101 --> 00:19:30.602
Goodness!

00:19:30.669 --> 00:19:34.339
You worked on
the Shibuya Ortho renewal?

00:19:34.406 --> 00:19:35.407
Yes.

00:19:36.108 --> 00:19:38.644
You've steadily built your career

00:19:38.710 --> 00:19:41.780
but have you ever
considered quitting?

00:19:42.948 --> 00:19:44.783
Let's see...

00:19:45.617 --> 00:19:47.953
There were times when I lost my cool

00:19:48.253 --> 00:19:50.489
but never enough to want to quit.

00:19:50.556 --> 00:19:51.557
Not even once.

00:19:55.427 --> 00:19:56.428
I'm lying.

00:19:59.097 --> 00:20:01.900
It happened when I was 29.

00:20:05.904 --> 00:20:08.307
Confirmed. Please reset.

00:20:08.473 --> 00:20:11.343
I was transferred
to a property management subsidiary.

00:20:12.377 --> 00:20:13.378
Of course.

00:20:17.983 --> 00:20:19.518
Get your boss.

00:20:19.585 --> 00:20:21.253
Talking to you is a waste of time.

00:20:21.620 --> 00:20:22.721
I'm sorry.

00:20:23.288 --> 00:20:25.157
Good grief.

00:20:25.591 --> 00:20:27.426
I keep repeating myself.

00:20:28.193 --> 00:20:30.329
I felt unfulfilled at work.

00:20:30.395 --> 00:20:31.930
I've told you so many times already.

00:20:31.997 --> 00:20:33.098
Do you understand?

00:20:33.398 --> 00:20:36.268
ELEVATOR MAINTENANCE NOTICE

00:20:36.368 --> 00:20:37.936
It's out of order?

00:20:39.838 --> 00:20:43.008
I subconsciously wanted to find
something worthwhile about myself

00:20:43.375 --> 00:20:44.776
outside of my work.

00:20:47.079 --> 00:20:50.549
Have you ever heard
of the superstring theory?

00:20:51.650 --> 00:20:54.253
That was when I met Mitsuhiro.

00:20:56.922 --> 00:20:57.990
- Cheers.
- Yes.

00:20:59.658 --> 00:21:01.326
- See?
- Stop that.

00:21:01.393 --> 00:21:05.264
- Don't play with your food.
- I-I'm not playing around.

00:21:05.330 --> 00:21:07.699
My dopamine was overflowing.

00:21:10.569 --> 00:21:11.670
What is this?

00:21:12.738 --> 00:21:13.739
Back then...

00:21:14.172 --> 00:21:15.173
Okay.

00:21:15.707 --> 00:21:16.708
Bye, then.

00:21:18.543 --> 00:21:21.413
...I spontaneously used love
to escape from work.

00:21:25.384 --> 00:21:26.418
And your husband?

00:21:27.919 --> 00:21:29.888
- Yes?
- And your husband?

00:21:30.022 --> 00:21:33.692
What does he think about your career?

00:21:34.960 --> 00:21:36.428
Well...

00:21:37.095 --> 00:21:38.597
He hasn't said much.

00:21:42.434 --> 00:21:46.605
We try not to talk about work
while we're at home

00:21:46.972 --> 00:21:50.008
but he notices
when things are busy for me

00:21:50.342 --> 00:21:53.512
and helps out
by doing housework and such.

00:21:55.847 --> 00:21:56.915
Another lie.

00:21:57.349 --> 00:21:59.718
- And thanks to my husband...
- Lies.

00:21:59.785 --> 00:22:03.989
Lies.

00:22:04.690 --> 00:22:05.724
The life I led...

00:22:07.392 --> 00:22:10.962
Was it bad enough
to warrant lies when I speak?

00:22:14.132 --> 00:22:16.568
Moving on to the next question.

00:22:16.768 --> 00:22:19.404
While you're working...

00:22:21.606 --> 00:22:23.975
- This looks tasty!
- So cute!

00:22:24.109 --> 00:22:27.045
Why'd you never tell us?

00:22:27.112 --> 00:22:28.480
Seriously.

00:22:28.547 --> 00:22:31.883
I didn't know
you had such a nice husband.

00:22:31.950 --> 00:22:34.986
Please, I thought this was normal.

00:22:35.053 --> 00:22:37.989
I'm so jealous that
your husband makes Yuna's lunches.

00:22:38.490 --> 00:22:41.026
I'm so jealous.

00:22:41.593 --> 00:22:43.962
- Oh, my.
- Gosh.

00:22:44.029 --> 00:22:45.030
It's Noa's mom.

00:22:45.263 --> 00:22:47.566
- Hello!
- Hello!

00:22:47.833 --> 00:22:48.834
It's Noa!

00:22:49.067 --> 00:22:50.802
- Take a seat.
- May I?

00:22:51.103 --> 00:22:52.571
Of course.

00:22:53.739 --> 00:22:55.073
What are you looking at?

00:22:55.140 --> 00:22:57.209
These? They're Yurika's photos.

00:22:57.275 --> 00:22:58.810
Let me see!

00:22:59.511 --> 00:23:01.813
Wow, this looks lovely!

00:23:02.381 --> 00:23:03.382
What?

00:23:03.749 --> 00:23:06.585
But are there any photos
of Yuna and her dad together?

00:23:07.719 --> 00:23:09.287
Is Noa attached to her dad?

00:23:09.821 --> 00:23:13.658
Noa? She loves her dad.
She wants to marry him.

00:23:13.725 --> 00:23:15.293
What?!

00:23:15.360 --> 00:23:17.129
I bet he loves that.

00:23:17.195 --> 00:23:18.196
Yes.

00:23:18.397 --> 00:23:20.031
It makes me happy too.

00:23:20.899 --> 00:23:22.667
I mean, if my daughter says that

00:23:22.734 --> 00:23:25.670
then I must have chosen
the right man to marry, right?

00:23:28.006 --> 00:23:32.010
- Of course.
- I'm in awe.

00:23:33.845 --> 00:23:36.148
- Right?
- Right?

00:23:54.433 --> 00:23:56.735
Why are you here, Ryosuke?

00:23:56.935 --> 00:23:58.670
What if my husband sees you?

00:23:59.237 --> 00:24:01.807
I figured he wouldn't be here
at this hour.

00:24:02.707 --> 00:24:03.875
Yes, but...

00:24:04.276 --> 00:24:07.779
Riko, when your phone's off,
I don't get to hear your voice.

00:24:09.247 --> 00:24:10.315
I couldn't bear that.

00:24:14.319 --> 00:24:15.454
I already told you.

00:24:15.687 --> 00:24:18.857
My husband and I had a tiff
and he's a bit sensitive now.

00:24:19.324 --> 00:24:20.959
So when things calm down...

00:24:21.460 --> 00:24:22.461
Hey!

00:24:24.329 --> 00:24:25.597
I love you, Riko.

00:24:40.178 --> 00:24:42.647
Well, we survived another day.

00:24:42.948 --> 00:24:44.316
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

00:24:56.528 --> 00:24:58.063
A possessive husband.

00:24:59.231 --> 00:25:01.333
An affair with a young doctor.

00:25:02.968 --> 00:25:03.969
I'm sorry.

00:25:05.871 --> 00:25:07.939
I was so confident in marrying him

00:25:08.573 --> 00:25:10.275
that I was too embarrassed
to tell you.

00:25:11.510 --> 00:25:12.511
It's fine.

00:25:13.245 --> 00:25:14.246
But wait.

00:25:14.346 --> 00:25:16.314
Are you okay being here?

00:25:16.715 --> 00:25:19.384
Yes, my husband gets back at 11 p.m.

00:25:19.951 --> 00:25:21.686
I left my other phone at home

00:25:22.954 --> 00:25:25.590
so he'll think I'm at home
the whole time.

00:25:30.562 --> 00:25:32.764
Riko, you're so smart.

00:25:32.964 --> 00:25:36.835
That means you have
to get back before Hiroki, right?

00:25:39.037 --> 00:25:40.171
I'm sorry, Maya.

00:25:40.705 --> 00:25:44.075
I meant to erase any private texts
whenever I get them

00:25:44.643 --> 00:25:47.913
but I totally forgot
about the ones you sent earlier.

00:25:48.713 --> 00:25:49.814
Yes, it's fine.

00:25:50.415 --> 00:25:51.850
But before things got worse

00:25:52.150 --> 00:25:54.486
I told him Mitsuhiro came home.

00:25:54.553 --> 00:25:55.554
So don't worry.

00:25:56.855 --> 00:25:57.889
But I can't believe

00:25:57.956 --> 00:26:00.792
he'd go wild just because
you didn't tell him something.

00:26:00.859 --> 00:26:01.860
Right?

00:26:02.594 --> 00:26:06.064
That's why I'm so scared
that I can't bring up divorce.

00:26:06.998 --> 00:26:09.534
So if he finds out
about the affair...

00:26:10.802 --> 00:26:12.137
Someone might die.

00:26:17.842 --> 00:26:19.110
I shouldn't say this

00:26:20.779 --> 00:26:22.647
but I'm jealous of you two.

00:26:29.220 --> 00:26:33.491
Back then, I never imagined
this could be our reality.

00:26:40.065 --> 00:26:44.169
Hey, I wonder which one of us
will get married first.

00:26:44.235 --> 00:26:45.236
What?

00:26:45.303 --> 00:26:46.471
- Married?
- Yes.

00:26:46.538 --> 00:26:49.140
- It's not me.
- Why not?

00:26:49.407 --> 00:26:50.775
My money's on Riko.

00:26:50.842 --> 00:26:55.046
- What? Me?
- Well, you're popular and mature.

00:26:55.113 --> 00:26:57.382
You'll find a good guy in no time.

00:26:57.449 --> 00:26:58.750
In no time?

00:26:58.984 --> 00:27:00.752
As for you, Maya

00:27:01.186 --> 00:27:03.388
your husband will be like a friend.

00:27:03.455 --> 00:27:07.492
You'll marry a nice partner
who will respect you as an equal.

00:27:07.559 --> 00:27:09.094
Oh, that's nice.

00:27:09.160 --> 00:27:10.161
What about me?

00:27:10.996 --> 00:27:12.897
Yours will be

00:27:13.264 --> 00:27:14.532
someone dependable.

00:27:15.100 --> 00:27:16.635
I like guys like that.

00:27:17.702 --> 00:27:19.904
But it's still hard to imagine.

00:27:20.505 --> 00:27:24.142
I bet we'll be so happy,
starting a family with who we love.

00:27:25.577 --> 00:27:27.012
Invite me to your wedding, okay?

00:27:28.213 --> 00:27:29.247
Isn't that a given?

00:27:30.749 --> 00:27:31.983
Aren't you jumping the gun?

00:27:32.183 --> 00:27:33.218
That's true.

00:27:33.284 --> 00:27:34.786
The reality

00:27:35.654 --> 00:27:38.156
- of our marriages.
- That's still a long way out.

00:27:38.423 --> 00:27:39.591
A long way out.

00:27:41.026 --> 00:27:43.695
Ryosuke,
Thank you for coming.

00:27:50.468 --> 00:27:51.536
What are you doing?

00:27:54.139 --> 00:27:56.107
Hey, you're home early.

00:27:56.841 --> 00:27:57.942
Weren't you at home?

00:27:59.010 --> 00:28:00.011
I was.

00:28:00.345 --> 00:28:03.114
But I'm on a walk
to get some fresh air.

00:28:03.715 --> 00:28:04.716
A walk?

00:28:07.018 --> 00:28:08.019
That's weird.

00:28:08.653 --> 00:28:10.021
Gosh, my phone.

00:28:10.321 --> 00:28:11.523
I forgot it at home.

00:28:19.531 --> 00:28:21.499
No, that's dangerous!

00:28:21.566 --> 00:28:23.034
What if something happens?

00:28:23.334 --> 00:28:25.970
Always take your phone
when you walk around at night.

00:28:30.642 --> 00:28:32.644
Staying in all day
can be suffocating, huh?

00:28:33.411 --> 00:28:34.779
Let's take a stroll together.

00:28:34.846 --> 00:28:37.649
No, aren't you tired? Let's go home.

00:28:38.817 --> 00:28:39.851
Yes.

00:28:45.156 --> 00:28:46.157
Come on.

00:28:50.662 --> 00:28:52.831
So, what were you writing today?

00:28:54.065 --> 00:28:55.700
I had several projects.

00:28:56.634 --> 00:28:57.635
Like what?

00:28:58.269 --> 00:29:00.805
- Gosh!
- Hey, careful now.

00:29:03.141 --> 00:29:04.609
Are you okay on time, Yurika?

00:29:04.676 --> 00:29:05.977
Yes, totally fine.

00:29:07.245 --> 00:29:09.547
Garbie must've really changed.

00:29:10.315 --> 00:29:12.183
Garbie is gone now.

00:29:12.517 --> 00:29:13.752
Oh, right. I'm sorry.

00:29:14.119 --> 00:29:15.120
I meant Tetsuya.

00:29:16.354 --> 00:29:17.388
I saw the photo.

00:29:17.689 --> 00:29:19.991
You're raising him
into a great husband.

00:29:20.759 --> 00:29:21.893
I'm not done yet.

00:29:22.193 --> 00:29:25.597
I'm going to raise him
into an even better husband.

00:29:31.302 --> 00:29:33.238
"'I'll protect the castle!

00:29:33.638 --> 00:29:34.806
Leave it to me!

00:29:36.941 --> 00:29:39.010
I love this castle!

00:29:39.577 --> 00:29:41.446
I want to be with everyone!

00:29:42.147 --> 00:29:44.649
Super Kitty Punch!'

00:29:45.116 --> 00:29:49.454
He sends the demon flying
with his secret punch!"

00:29:50.021 --> 00:29:52.257
You're good at reading, Dad.

00:29:52.590 --> 00:29:53.992
Do you think so?

00:29:54.559 --> 00:29:55.794
Yes, I'm surprised!

00:29:57.162 --> 00:30:00.498
I practiced super hard
after your mom taught me.

00:30:01.499 --> 00:30:04.602
You've become a really great dad.

00:30:06.104 --> 00:30:08.807
Is it because mom and her friends
wrapped you up?

00:30:10.441 --> 00:30:11.442
Wrapped me up?

00:30:13.378 --> 00:30:14.579
Maya, get his legs.

00:30:17.549 --> 00:30:19.350
Yurika, clean up the persimmon seeds.

00:30:26.257 --> 00:30:29.861
People are nicer
after they're wrapped up, huh?

00:31:17.876 --> 00:31:20.245
I have to get back
before they suspect something.

00:31:25.283 --> 00:31:27.018
What lie did you use this time?

00:31:28.186 --> 00:31:31.389
I'm interviewing a pediatrician
at the hotel lounge.

00:31:33.458 --> 00:31:34.826
The pediatrician part is true.

00:31:38.563 --> 00:31:42.667
If you mix in a hint of truth,
it's harder to catch the lie.

00:31:46.537 --> 00:31:48.973
I'm sorry for making you lie.

00:31:52.176 --> 00:31:53.578
No, it's my problem.

00:31:55.680 --> 00:31:57.181
It's our problem.

00:31:58.917 --> 00:32:02.820
I'll think of ways
for us to be together too.

00:32:06.758 --> 00:32:07.759
Ryosuke.

00:32:21.406 --> 00:32:23.074
I'm going to take a bath.

00:32:23.441 --> 00:32:26.477
- Okay.
- Want to take a bath with me, Yuna?

00:32:26.544 --> 00:32:27.845
I want to go with Dad.

00:32:28.079 --> 00:32:29.547
With Dad?

00:32:29.814 --> 00:32:33.284
You're totally a dad's girl now.
Do you like Dad?

00:32:33.985 --> 00:32:36.888
Gosh, so cute.

00:32:48.599 --> 00:32:51.269
Hey, don't touch that!

00:32:51.536 --> 00:32:53.237
That's important to me.

00:32:53.304 --> 00:32:55.006
That's important to me!

00:32:58.576 --> 00:32:59.877
Just die already!

00:33:10.588 --> 00:33:13.024
Dad, are you okay?

00:33:18.830 --> 00:33:19.964
Can I sit here?

00:33:20.932 --> 00:33:21.933
Go ahead.

00:33:25.903 --> 00:33:26.938
Ms. Komoto.

00:33:27.405 --> 00:33:28.940
Did you lie?

00:33:29.741 --> 00:33:30.742
What?

00:33:31.876 --> 00:33:32.944
About what?

00:33:36.147 --> 00:33:37.348
The interview you did.

00:33:38.750 --> 00:33:41.719
A WOMAN'S VOICE IN URBAN PLANNING
SPOUSES THAT BUILD EACH OTHER UP

00:33:43.454 --> 00:33:45.356
I didn't lie.

00:33:46.424 --> 00:33:47.425
Are you sure?

00:33:49.527 --> 00:33:51.929
You didn't lie
about your private life?

00:33:57.802 --> 00:34:00.104
I'm not asking out of curiosity

00:34:00.605 --> 00:34:02.974
or because I'm worried about you.

00:34:03.841 --> 00:34:05.376
I'm minimizing our risks.

00:34:06.744 --> 00:34:11.849
If you get divorced or get into
a scandal right after this article

00:34:11.916 --> 00:34:13.985
it's bad for the company,
so I'm making sure.

00:34:17.422 --> 00:34:19.424
If only you'd just die!

00:34:24.028 --> 00:34:26.464
No, there's nothing to worry about.

00:34:27.365 --> 00:34:29.267
I see. That's fine then.

00:34:31.335 --> 00:34:32.336
Goodbye then.

00:34:34.672 --> 00:34:36.707
I didn't think about that.

00:34:38.376 --> 00:34:41.846
I can't let my company know
that my husband went missing.

00:34:42.814 --> 00:34:43.815
Maya.

00:34:46.317 --> 00:34:47.752
The police just called.

00:34:48.519 --> 00:34:49.520
The police?

00:34:53.458 --> 00:34:54.459
Why the office?

00:34:55.893 --> 00:34:57.328
Well...

00:34:57.562 --> 00:34:58.563
What's wrong?

00:34:59.330 --> 00:35:00.331
Chief.

00:35:00.898 --> 00:35:01.899
Actually...

00:35:16.814 --> 00:35:18.149
I'm starving.

00:35:19.016 --> 00:35:21.619
The restaurant here is pretty good.

00:35:21.686 --> 00:35:22.753
Really?

00:35:41.105 --> 00:35:42.940
RIKO

00:38:11.689 --> 00:38:13.691
Riko!

00:38:13.758 --> 00:38:14.759
You're kidding.

00:38:14.825 --> 00:38:16.227
Why is Hiroki here?

00:38:16.294 --> 00:38:18.562
- Surprise.
- A crisis, and it's only Episode 4!

00:38:18.629 --> 00:38:22.033
I'm just so happy nowadays.

00:38:22.099 --> 00:38:24.368
Oh, really? I'm happy for you.

00:38:24.702 --> 00:38:29.473
But we three will still find
happiness at any cost.

00:38:29.707 --> 00:38:31.208
You're so cool!

00:38:31.275 --> 00:38:32.410
Don't make fun of me!

00:38:32.643 --> 00:38:35.246
Next week on Please Die My Beloved.

00:38:35.746 --> 00:38:37.081
"Fleeting Ecstasy."

00:38:37.315 --> 00:38:41.485
Should I really move on without
finding out what happened to him?
