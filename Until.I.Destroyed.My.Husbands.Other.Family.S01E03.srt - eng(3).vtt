00:00:22.555 --> 00:00:25.558
I'm sorry I fell asleep, Hiromi.

00:00:25.625 --> 00:00:27.327
It's okay. You can lie down.

00:00:27.827 --> 00:00:31.031
- I can help.
- You don't have to.

00:00:33.066 --> 00:00:35.301
- Tsubasa.
- He's fast asleep.

00:00:42.642 --> 00:00:45.678
Minori? Did you lose a little weight?

00:00:48.882 --> 00:00:50.283
Are you eating properly?

00:00:50.817 --> 00:00:53.920
Um... I don't have much
of an appetite.

00:00:53.987 --> 00:00:56.756
You have to eat something
even if you don't have an appetite.

00:00:56.823 --> 00:00:57.924
Wait a second.

00:01:03.696 --> 00:01:05.532
There you go. Eat.

00:01:06.032 --> 00:01:07.667
Thank you very much.

00:01:17.377 --> 00:01:19.279
Minori. Here.

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:21.481
I'm sorry.

00:01:23.216 --> 00:01:24.584
Are you...

00:01:26.319 --> 00:01:28.154
pregnant by any chance?

00:01:33.359 --> 00:01:34.394
I'm going to be

00:01:35.395 --> 00:01:36.863
a big brother.

00:01:38.364 --> 00:01:39.365
What?

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:41.734
Actually...

00:01:43.203 --> 00:01:45.572
a baby is coming next year.

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:48.174
I was hoping

00:01:49.309 --> 00:01:52.645
that it was just a bad joke.

00:02:01.621 --> 00:02:02.822
But now

00:02:03.823 --> 00:02:05.058
I know

00:02:06.292 --> 00:02:09.362
the stone-cold fact.

00:02:13.766 --> 00:02:18.371
I bet Yudai would be thrilled.
Why don't you see a gynecologist?

00:02:21.007 --> 00:02:23.877
I don't think I am.

00:02:24.711 --> 00:02:25.945
Mrs. Kisaragi--

00:02:26.713 --> 00:02:27.881
I'm certain.

00:02:28.548 --> 00:02:31.784
The one who is pregnant
with your son's child

00:02:32.952 --> 00:02:34.420
is not me.

00:02:36.589 --> 00:02:38.224
It's this woman.

00:03:32.579 --> 00:03:37.817
UNTIL I DESTROYED
MY HUSBAND'S OTHER FAMILY

00:03:53.366 --> 00:03:56.502
I despise my husband so much
I want to exact revenge

00:03:57.971 --> 00:03:59.372
but I couldn't help

00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:03.042
being a little hopeful.

00:04:05.345 --> 00:04:08.248
It's because I've been wanting
a second child for a long time.

00:04:16.823 --> 00:04:18.191
Why do I have to make

00:04:19.425 --> 00:04:22.962
a meal for that man
on a day like this?

00:04:33.373 --> 00:04:34.507
I'll hold it for you.

00:04:35.008 --> 00:04:36.276
Wataru?

00:04:40.546 --> 00:04:43.750
What a coincidence
to be seeing you here.

00:04:44.951 --> 00:04:47.453
No, it's not a coincidence.

00:04:51.424 --> 00:04:54.260
Wait, were you waiting for me?

00:04:55.461 --> 00:04:59.499
I heard you live around here,
so I thought maybe I'd see you.

00:05:04.871 --> 00:05:07.974
I was worried.
Why are you absent from cram school?

00:05:08.474 --> 00:05:11.177
I'm sorry. I was feeling
under the weather.

00:05:12.412 --> 00:05:14.147
You seem a little thinner.

00:05:15.181 --> 00:05:16.649
Yeah, a little.

00:05:18.151 --> 00:05:21.754
- Are you okay now?
- Yeah, I'm much better.

00:05:25.224 --> 00:05:27.827
Was it my fault?

00:05:31.931 --> 00:05:33.266
Why do you think so?

00:05:34.867 --> 00:05:36.736
The other day
when I asked you for advice

00:05:37.570 --> 00:05:39.639
you were acting a bit weird.

00:05:43.443 --> 00:05:45.345
A baby is coming next year.

00:05:46.546 --> 00:05:47.647
What?

00:05:51.751 --> 00:05:53.219
You're overthinking it.

00:05:53.920 --> 00:05:56.956
I'd just gotten back to work after
a long time, so it wore me out.

00:05:57.824 --> 00:06:00.126
Then I'm relieved.

00:06:08.434 --> 00:06:10.169
How is your mom feeling?

00:06:10.803 --> 00:06:13.906
- She's calmed down now.
- Oh.

00:06:14.707 --> 00:06:16.676
- That's good.
- Yes.

00:06:17.343 --> 00:06:18.344
And...

00:06:21.614 --> 00:06:23.383
that man who's your father figure...

00:06:24.650 --> 00:06:29.088
How does Yudai feel
about having another child?

00:06:30.189 --> 00:06:31.491
Was he excited?

00:06:32.492 --> 00:06:35.928
Yes. He was very excited,
more than I expected.

00:06:36.596 --> 00:06:39.232
He says he can't wait
to meet the baby.

00:06:41.267 --> 00:06:43.269
Aren't they getting married?

00:06:44.604 --> 00:06:46.439
The man who's your father figure

00:06:47.240 --> 00:06:48.441
and your mom?

00:06:52.278 --> 00:06:54.247
Since a baby is coming

00:06:55.248 --> 00:06:57.784
I heard he's talking about
getting married eventually.

00:07:01.354 --> 00:07:02.455
Ms. Kume?

00:07:12.165 --> 00:07:13.599
Sorry, Wataru.

00:07:13.666 --> 00:07:16.335
I have to go home to make dinner now.

00:07:17.003 --> 00:07:18.271
See you at cram school.

00:07:24.877 --> 00:07:29.649
If you ever cheat on me

00:07:30.149 --> 00:07:35.988
Be careful when eating at home

00:07:37.089 --> 00:07:38.891
I'll be wise

00:07:38.958 --> 00:07:43.396
I'll be creative

00:07:44.230 --> 00:07:48.835
I'll make soup with poison in it
And we'll have it

00:07:48.901 --> 00:07:52.371
Together

00:07:52.438 --> 00:07:56.008
The room, the dress shirt, and me

00:07:56.075 --> 00:07:59.011
For you, my love

00:07:59.078 --> 00:08:04.584
I want to polish everyday

00:08:05.351 --> 00:08:06.719
I'm home.

00:08:11.324 --> 00:08:13.092
I heard you weren't
feeling well yesterday.

00:08:13.626 --> 00:08:15.094
My mom told me.

00:08:15.628 --> 00:08:19.298
- Oh. Mm-hmm.
- Are you okay now?

00:08:19.899 --> 00:08:23.169
Yeah. I'm fine now.

00:08:23.236 --> 00:08:24.504
That's good.

00:08:27.240 --> 00:08:28.441
Is that it?

00:08:30.176 --> 00:08:32.745
You rushed to the hospital
to visit that woman.

00:08:33.946 --> 00:08:35.114
But for me

00:08:35.748 --> 00:08:37.383
just one word?

00:08:37.884 --> 00:08:39.685
Tsubasa.

00:08:40.887 --> 00:08:43.756
Looks like he's asleep.

00:08:47.793 --> 00:08:50.062
Oh, are you making pasta today?

00:08:50.630 --> 00:08:51.664
Yeah.

00:08:52.431 --> 00:08:56.035
- Can you guess what kind of pasta?
- What kind of pasta...

00:08:56.102 --> 00:08:58.204
Huh? Isn't this tomato sauce?

00:08:59.372 --> 00:09:01.541
Have you heard of desperation pasta?

00:09:02.041 --> 00:09:05.177
What's that? Desperation pasta?

00:09:05.711 --> 00:09:09.282
A dish that tastes good
even when you feel desperate.

00:09:10.416 --> 00:09:11.417
Huh?

00:09:13.085 --> 00:09:15.288
That's where the name
comes from supposedly.

00:09:16.122 --> 00:09:17.456
In Italy

00:09:17.523 --> 00:09:21.894
that's what they call a pasta dish
made with leftovers in the fridge.

00:09:21.961 --> 00:09:24.196
You startled me for a second.

00:09:24.263 --> 00:09:26.666
I thought something had happened
that made you feel des--

00:09:26.732 --> 00:09:27.867
There was.

00:09:28.901 --> 00:09:29.902
Huh?

00:09:31.971 --> 00:09:33.172
An affair.

00:09:34.874 --> 00:09:35.875
What?

00:09:37.610 --> 00:09:39.111
There was an affair.

00:09:45.217 --> 00:09:46.519
By my friend's husband.

00:09:49.722 --> 00:09:50.756
Really.

00:09:52.491 --> 00:09:53.826
My friend said

00:09:54.493 --> 00:09:58.097
she and her husband were
getting along so well until one day

00:09:58.164 --> 00:10:02.802
she found out that her husband
was having an affair.

00:10:04.403 --> 00:10:05.404
What do you think?

00:10:07.073 --> 00:10:08.741
That...

00:10:11.711 --> 00:10:13.179
is just terrible.

00:10:14.513 --> 00:10:15.615
Isn't it?

00:10:17.516 --> 00:10:19.452
That's why I was feeling desperate.

00:10:21.587 --> 00:10:24.557
It's sweet how much
you care about your friend.

00:10:25.891 --> 00:10:27.226
That's right.

00:10:28.427 --> 00:10:29.762
I had forgotten.

00:10:31.430 --> 00:10:34.934
You're very good at telling lies.

00:10:36.602 --> 00:10:38.671
You can do it
just as natural as breathing.

00:10:41.507 --> 00:10:42.875
Then...

00:10:44.677 --> 00:10:45.945
I should do it, too.

00:10:48.481 --> 00:10:51.384
Thanks for helping me
with my situation.

00:10:53.285 --> 00:10:56.589
No problem.
I'll always be here for you.

00:11:04.530 --> 00:11:05.731
- Hey.
- Hmm?

00:11:07.099 --> 00:11:09.468
- Are you okay?
- Huh?

00:11:10.636 --> 00:11:11.937
Are you getting enough sleep?

00:11:14.507 --> 00:11:15.775
I'm okay.

00:11:17.510 --> 00:11:18.844
I'm glad to hear that.

00:11:19.412 --> 00:11:24.116
You tend to have a one-track mind
when you focus on something.

00:11:24.750 --> 00:11:27.086
Ah, well...

00:11:27.653 --> 00:11:29.655
Maybe that's true. I know.

00:11:34.694 --> 00:11:35.761
But hear me out.

00:11:37.563 --> 00:11:39.632
I can't be satisfied
by just divorcing him.

00:11:40.599 --> 00:11:43.769
Because that's exactly
what they want, isn't it?

00:11:45.337 --> 00:11:47.606
I just know it.

00:11:48.207 --> 00:11:50.443
Yudai intends to start
a new family with them.

00:11:52.244 --> 00:11:56.649
She's pregnant! That woman
is having Yudai's baby!

00:11:57.817 --> 00:11:59.819
Wait, are you sure?

00:11:59.885 --> 00:12:01.654
Yeah, I already checked.

00:12:06.459 --> 00:12:08.027
He's really the worst.

00:12:08.894 --> 00:12:11.764
I didn't think it was this bad.

00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:16.068
That's why...

00:12:18.971 --> 00:12:21.474
I'm absolutely not
letting them be happy.

00:12:25.377 --> 00:12:26.612
- Kusunoki.
- Yes?

00:12:26.679 --> 00:12:29.548
Would you share the minutes you took
for the meeting later?

00:12:29.615 --> 00:12:30.649
Got it.

00:12:32.651 --> 00:12:35.521
Chief, did you eat garlic yesterday?

00:12:35.588 --> 00:12:39.692
Huh? Oh, there was garlic
in the pasta I ate yesterday.

00:12:39.759 --> 00:12:41.660
- Huh? You can smell it?
- Yes.

00:12:41.727 --> 00:12:43.095
It smells pretty strong.

00:12:43.729 --> 00:12:44.797
Seriously?

00:12:48.701 --> 00:12:49.835
Chief.

00:12:50.402 --> 00:12:53.806
Your wife might
be marking you with a scent.

00:12:54.340 --> 00:12:55.975
Huh? What does that mean?

00:12:56.041 --> 00:12:57.443
She might be

00:12:57.510 --> 00:13:01.947
marking you so that other women
wouldn't come near you.

00:13:02.014 --> 00:13:04.416
Whoa. That's a scary tactic.

00:13:04.483 --> 00:13:07.419
Another thing I would do
is to pretend that my friend

00:13:07.486 --> 00:13:09.989
was the one having doubts

00:13:10.055 --> 00:13:13.292
and vent my own frustrations.

00:13:15.494 --> 00:13:16.695
What?

00:13:16.762 --> 00:13:19.331
- What's wrong, Chief?
- Uh, nothing.

00:13:20.199 --> 00:13:23.836
Kusunoki, I have to go
to a client's office now.

00:13:23.903 --> 00:13:25.905
- I'll leave it to you today.
- What?

00:13:25.971 --> 00:13:27.039
Just me?

00:13:36.816 --> 00:13:38.150
I'm home.

00:13:41.754 --> 00:13:42.988
What happened?

00:13:44.323 --> 00:13:46.826
It's rare that
you come home this early.

00:13:46.892 --> 00:13:48.394
Huh? Is it?

00:13:48.460 --> 00:13:51.063
Well, my work
is not that busy recently.

00:13:51.997 --> 00:13:52.998
I see.

00:13:54.166 --> 00:13:58.204
Oh, sorry. I haven't started
making dinner yet.

00:13:59.338 --> 00:14:00.472
Minori.

00:14:02.074 --> 00:14:04.310
I can come home early tomorrow, too.

00:14:04.977 --> 00:14:08.581
Do you want the three of us
to go out together as family?

00:14:14.086 --> 00:14:15.087
Sorry.

00:14:16.555 --> 00:14:17.656
I'm going to

00:14:18.257 --> 00:14:19.925
be working late tomorrow.

00:14:21.393 --> 00:14:23.896
There's an important practice test
at the cram school.

00:14:25.698 --> 00:14:26.899
I see.

00:14:28.434 --> 00:14:30.135
Don't work too hard.

00:14:32.638 --> 00:14:33.639
Mm-hmm.

00:14:34.940 --> 00:14:36.008
Thanks.

00:14:37.343 --> 00:14:39.812
You proabably think
I don't know anything

00:14:41.080 --> 00:14:45.184
and that I'm just a meek wife.

00:14:47.052 --> 00:14:48.721
If so...

00:14:50.856 --> 00:14:52.424
you're underestimating me.

00:14:53.058 --> 00:14:54.093
Yudai.

00:14:54.727 --> 00:14:55.728
Hmm?

00:14:56.662 --> 00:14:58.130
Can you go take a shower?

00:14:59.598 --> 00:15:01.533
Hmm? Okay.

00:15:08.674 --> 00:15:09.708
Oh.

00:15:11.410 --> 00:15:13.345
- Yudai.
- Hmm?

00:15:13.412 --> 00:15:16.615
I'm thinking about cutting
my hair. What do you think?

00:15:16.949 --> 00:15:18.050
Sounds good to me.

00:15:25.090 --> 00:15:26.725
Just remember...

00:15:27.526 --> 00:15:29.828
More than you could ever imagine

00:15:30.729 --> 00:15:31.964
the real me is bold

00:15:33.165 --> 00:15:35.634
and has the ability

00:15:36.702 --> 00:15:38.337
to take action.

00:15:38.771 --> 00:15:40.806
I think it turned out really cute.

00:15:40.873 --> 00:15:43.275
Manager, a new customer has arrived.

00:15:43.342 --> 00:15:45.010
Excuse me.

00:15:53.986 --> 00:15:57.056
Hello. Thank you for coming.

00:15:57.923 --> 00:15:59.358
I apologize for popping in

00:15:59.925 --> 00:16:01.493
without a reservation.

00:16:02.361 --> 00:16:03.462
Yudai.

00:16:04.663 --> 00:16:05.864
Are you

00:16:06.765 --> 00:16:08.400
ready for this?

00:16:09.935 --> 00:16:11.103
I'm about to

00:16:12.104 --> 00:16:14.673
ask this woman about the truth.

00:16:20.379 --> 00:16:21.847
What can I do for you today?

00:16:23.882 --> 00:16:25.084
I want to...

00:16:26.385 --> 00:16:27.619
chop a lot of it off.

00:16:29.421 --> 00:16:32.124
Recently, I felt like
it's getting in the way.

00:16:33.192 --> 00:16:34.293
Certainly.

00:16:35.194 --> 00:16:36.295
Excuse me.

00:16:40.733 --> 00:16:43.035
How about this length?

00:16:44.303 --> 00:16:46.171
People might think I got dumped

00:16:46.872 --> 00:16:48.440
won't they?

00:16:49.108 --> 00:16:50.109
Huh?

00:16:50.843 --> 00:16:55.147
Didn't your friends think you had
a broken heart if you cut your hair?

00:16:57.549 --> 00:17:00.386
- Yes, they used to say that.
- Well...

00:17:00.886 --> 00:17:03.889
I can understand the feeling of
wanting to cut your hair

00:17:03.956 --> 00:17:05.491
when heartbroken. Can't you?

00:17:06.625 --> 00:17:07.793
Yes, I can.

00:17:09.395 --> 00:17:11.797
Okay, let's start with shampoo.

00:17:13.866 --> 00:17:14.867
This way, please.

00:17:15.701 --> 00:17:18.303
Have you had your hair at that length
for a long time?

00:17:19.338 --> 00:17:23.909
- Um, yes.
- My hair used to be much longer.

00:17:23.976 --> 00:17:26.578
I let it grow for my wedding day.

00:17:27.079 --> 00:17:32.351
I see. A lot of people grow their
hair long for their wedding ceremony.

00:17:34.653 --> 00:17:36.789
I thought so.

00:17:37.856 --> 00:17:39.958
Okay. Let's move
to the shampoo basin.

00:17:40.459 --> 00:17:42.227
I see...

00:17:50.469 --> 00:17:52.404
How long has it been
since you last cut it?

00:17:53.405 --> 00:17:55.607
I had it cut three months ago.

00:17:56.408 --> 00:17:59.244
- Oh, then it's been a while.
- But...

00:18:00.312 --> 00:18:02.748
My husband gets a haircut
every other week.

00:18:04.483 --> 00:18:05.484
Huh?

00:18:06.151 --> 00:18:07.152
Huh?

00:18:08.587 --> 00:18:09.922
Are you okay?

00:18:12.291 --> 00:18:13.725
Oh, I'm sorry.

00:18:16.862 --> 00:18:18.997
Men have short hair

00:18:20.099 --> 00:18:21.867
so their hair grows out faster,
doesn't it?

00:18:23.569 --> 00:18:25.037
It seems so.

00:18:33.579 --> 00:18:35.147
So pretty.

00:18:37.249 --> 00:18:38.350
Huh?

00:18:39.118 --> 00:18:40.552
That necklace.

00:18:41.220 --> 00:18:43.722
Oh, this? Thank you.

00:18:43.789 --> 00:18:44.823
By any chance

00:18:45.324 --> 00:18:48.026
is it from Tsukishiro Jewelry?

00:18:49.027 --> 00:18:50.629
Is it a present

00:18:51.363 --> 00:18:52.965
from someone?

00:18:54.900 --> 00:18:57.336
It's a present from my son.

00:18:59.938 --> 00:19:01.974
Oh, you have a son.

00:19:03.308 --> 00:19:04.676
How old is he?

00:19:04.743 --> 00:19:06.879
He's 18 years old.

00:19:08.046 --> 00:19:10.949
You don't look like
you could have a son that age.

00:19:11.550 --> 00:19:12.851
Really?

00:19:18.957 --> 00:19:20.225
Ta-da.

00:19:21.493 --> 00:19:23.695
I have one, too.

00:19:26.865 --> 00:19:28.901
A present from my husband.

00:19:32.371 --> 00:19:33.906
He bought it for me

00:19:34.673 --> 00:19:36.208
just recently.

00:19:39.311 --> 00:19:42.281
I see. Just recently?

00:19:42.881 --> 00:19:45.684
- That's very nice.
- Yes.

00:19:52.858 --> 00:19:54.860
I'm sorry. Will you
excuse me for a moment?

00:19:55.494 --> 00:19:56.528
Sure.

00:20:06.271 --> 00:20:09.174
Why is she here?
Is this a coincidence?

00:20:10.042 --> 00:20:12.644
We weren't caught for over ten years.

00:20:13.245 --> 00:20:14.880
And at a time like this?

00:20:20.852 --> 00:20:23.188
- Are you okay?
- Uh...

00:20:24.456 --> 00:20:27.392
You looked pale, so I was worried.

00:20:31.163 --> 00:20:32.598
Could it be...

00:20:33.865 --> 00:20:35.200
morning sickness?

00:20:38.403 --> 00:20:40.005
I've had that experience, too.

00:20:40.772 --> 00:20:43.842
Please take care of yourself.

00:20:46.345 --> 00:20:49.881
Um, I'll be right back,
so please wait at your seat.

00:20:50.882 --> 00:20:52.351
Okay.

00:21:04.263 --> 00:21:05.797
I'm sorry for the interruption.

00:21:06.665 --> 00:21:08.166
I'm ready to cut your hair.

00:21:16.008 --> 00:21:17.476
Are you really all right?

00:21:18.010 --> 00:21:19.811
- What?
- I understand.

00:21:19.878 --> 00:21:21.513
I had bad morning sickness, too.

00:21:22.247 --> 00:21:24.016
No, I don't have--

00:21:24.082 --> 00:21:27.185
It's important to have
the full support of your partner.

00:21:29.254 --> 00:21:32.858
I think I was able to
get through my pregnancy

00:21:32.924 --> 00:21:34.793
thanks to the support
from my husband.

00:21:37.596 --> 00:21:39.264
I see.

00:21:41.500 --> 00:21:43.835
You have a thoughtful husband.

00:21:43.902 --> 00:21:49.007
Yes. Even after I gave birth,
he's very attached to his kid.

00:21:53.178 --> 00:21:55.580
I'm a single parent,
so it's been a struggle.

00:21:55.647 --> 00:21:58.150
Oh, you're a single mom?

00:21:58.216 --> 00:22:00.552
It must have been hard
taking care of a kid on your own.

00:22:02.821 --> 00:22:03.855
Huh?

00:22:07.459 --> 00:22:09.695
Does that mean the baby
in your belly right now

00:22:10.829 --> 00:22:12.798
is your second child?

00:22:15.033 --> 00:22:17.336
If you're pregnant now

00:22:19.004 --> 00:22:21.373
that means you have a partner, right?

00:22:22.307 --> 00:22:26.611
But when my son was little,
my partner supported me.

00:22:27.512 --> 00:22:28.714
He helped me a lot.

00:22:29.514 --> 00:22:32.584
My son grew up properly
thanks to him.

00:22:35.654 --> 00:22:38.490
Sons are so cute, aren't they?

00:22:38.557 --> 00:22:41.460
I have a son, too.

00:22:42.260 --> 00:22:45.297
- My son is in high school.
- Aren't you worried?

00:22:45.831 --> 00:22:47.366
- What?
- You know

00:22:47.432 --> 00:22:51.670
high school boys are
very much interested in girls.

00:22:51.737 --> 00:22:55.540
My son doesn't seem
to be interested at all.

00:22:55.607 --> 00:22:58.276
You never know with those types.

00:22:58.877 --> 00:22:59.878
Excuse me?

00:23:00.379 --> 00:23:01.546
I guess

00:23:02.180 --> 00:23:06.218
when they're that age, they're
not dependent on their parents.

00:23:07.586 --> 00:23:09.221
That's not true.

00:23:11.890 --> 00:23:12.891
Oh.

00:23:14.926 --> 00:23:15.961
I'm sorry.

00:23:17.696 --> 00:23:19.164
No, it's okay.

00:23:22.467 --> 00:23:24.436
Why aren't you married?

00:23:26.805 --> 00:23:27.806
What?

00:23:28.774 --> 00:23:29.875
To your partner

00:23:31.376 --> 00:23:33.345
who's supportive.

00:23:35.614 --> 00:23:37.215
Why aren't you married to him?

00:23:40.252 --> 00:23:41.319
Don't you think

00:23:43.922 --> 00:23:45.924
having a partner beside you

00:23:47.225 --> 00:23:49.394
is the most comforting?

00:23:52.631 --> 00:23:53.832
Well I...

00:23:57.169 --> 00:23:59.337
Manager, a customer is on the phone.

00:24:02.407 --> 00:24:04.776
I'm sorry. Excuse me for a moment.

00:24:11.550 --> 00:24:13.185
Thank you so much

00:24:14.619 --> 00:24:16.054
for making me pretty.

00:24:37.309 --> 00:24:39.544
Everything is delicious.

00:24:41.513 --> 00:24:44.282
Mommy, your hair looks cute.

00:24:44.349 --> 00:24:46.184
Thank you.

00:24:46.251 --> 00:24:49.921
- Isn't it cute, Daddy?
- Yeah. It looks good on Mommy.

00:24:50.522 --> 00:24:53.725
But why did you cut it so short
all of the sudden?

00:24:54.259 --> 00:24:55.293
Hmm?

00:24:55.861 --> 00:24:57.462
It kind of felt like
it was in the way.

00:24:58.396 --> 00:25:01.466
Short hair is easier for girls,
I guess.

00:25:01.533 --> 00:25:02.634
Yeah.

00:25:02.701 --> 00:25:05.103
Well, I felt like
I didn't need it anymore.

00:25:05.170 --> 00:25:06.471
What?

00:25:06.538 --> 00:25:09.407
So on impulse, I chopped it off.

00:25:09.474 --> 00:25:11.376
Chopped it off.

00:25:13.078 --> 00:25:16.348
We have almond tofu for dessert.

00:25:16.414 --> 00:25:18.817
Thank you so much.

00:25:18.884 --> 00:25:21.786
Your cooking has
improved again, Minori.

00:25:21.853 --> 00:25:24.422
Thanks to you, because
you always teach me.

00:25:24.489 --> 00:25:27.526
It's not me. You need talent
to be good at cooking.

00:25:27.592 --> 00:25:29.160
You're naturally good at it.

00:25:29.794 --> 00:25:33.298
Tsubasa. She said
I have a talent for cooking.

00:25:33.365 --> 00:25:34.799
Wasn't it good?

00:25:41.439 --> 00:25:42.741
RIKO
CAN YOU COME OVER NOW?

00:25:42.807 --> 00:25:44.809
Sorry, Tsubasa, can you climb down?

00:25:44.876 --> 00:25:46.211
Okay.

00:25:53.485 --> 00:25:55.186
Uh, Minori.

00:25:55.253 --> 00:25:57.022
- Can I--
- Hey, Yuta.

00:25:57.822 --> 00:25:59.958
Can you go take a bath with Tsubasa?

00:26:00.025 --> 00:26:01.826
Well, I, uh...

00:26:04.329 --> 00:26:05.463
How about it, Tsubasa?

00:26:07.632 --> 00:26:10.035
Don't you want to
take a bath with Daddy?

00:26:10.569 --> 00:26:14.306
Yeah. Let's continue
playing in the bath.

00:26:14.372 --> 00:26:16.775
Huh? Uh...

00:26:18.677 --> 00:26:19.711
- Why not?
- Yeah.

00:26:19.778 --> 00:26:21.980
- Let's go.
- Yay!

00:26:22.047 --> 00:26:27.519
Here we go.

00:26:29.754 --> 00:26:36.728
CAN YOU COME OVER NOW?
WE CAN GET MARRIED, RIGHT?

00:26:53.144 --> 00:26:55.347
The sin of having an affair

00:26:56.314 --> 00:26:57.816
is immeasurably huge.

00:26:58.917 --> 00:27:00.051
So...

00:27:01.386 --> 00:27:03.655
no matter how huge the cost

00:27:04.856 --> 00:27:07.092
I won't feel sorry for them.

00:27:08.693 --> 00:27:09.995
I will absolutely

00:27:11.229 --> 00:27:13.064
make them pay for their sins.

00:27:27.646 --> 00:27:28.647
Your hair.

00:27:29.981 --> 00:27:31.182
You cut it short.

00:27:32.951 --> 00:27:36.121
Maybe I had it made too short.

00:27:37.555 --> 00:27:38.823
It's super cute.

00:27:39.724 --> 00:27:44.029
Thank you. You're the only one
who's said that.

00:27:44.763 --> 00:27:45.764
Huh?

00:27:47.732 --> 00:27:49.000
Just you wait

00:27:49.968 --> 00:27:51.336
Ms. Riko Miyake.

00:27:53.271 --> 00:27:55.173
I'm going to personally steal

00:27:57.509 --> 00:28:00.311
your precious son from you.

00:28:02.414 --> 00:28:03.515
Oh?

00:28:04.549 --> 00:28:05.850
You smell nice.

00:28:06.851 --> 00:28:08.119
Are you using cologne?

00:28:09.587 --> 00:28:10.722
Um...

00:28:12.057 --> 00:28:13.224
Yes.

00:28:15.360 --> 00:28:18.063
By the way, about that reward...

00:28:18.663 --> 00:28:20.665
Is Anko Panic enough?

00:28:21.933 --> 00:28:25.837
What do you mean?

00:28:26.971 --> 00:28:28.773
If there's anything else I can do

00:28:30.375 --> 00:28:31.509
I'll do it.

00:28:35.647 --> 00:28:36.715
Huh?

00:28:37.582 --> 00:28:39.084
So you're letting me decide?

00:28:40.552 --> 00:28:41.586
Yeah.

00:28:48.126 --> 00:28:50.729
- My next class is starting.
- Do your best.

00:29:04.309 --> 00:29:06.411
- Ms. Kume.
- What is it?

00:29:07.112 --> 00:29:10.081
Do you like younger guys?

00:29:10.648 --> 00:29:11.716
What?

00:29:12.317 --> 00:29:17.222
I have a feeling
you're hitting on Wataru.

00:29:20.125 --> 00:29:21.392
Ms. Muto.

00:29:22.293 --> 00:29:25.263
- I'm married.
- Ah, I thought so.

00:29:25.964 --> 00:29:28.767
Why aren't you wearing a ring?

00:29:28.833 --> 00:29:30.602
I've never worn rings.

00:29:31.903 --> 00:29:33.204
I see.

00:29:35.740 --> 00:29:36.875
Goodbye.

00:29:40.612 --> 00:29:44.215
People have romantic relationships
even if they're married.

00:29:52.257 --> 00:29:53.992
I guess some people do.

00:29:56.127 --> 00:29:57.495
But I'm no longer interested

00:29:58.163 --> 00:30:00.231
in having romantic relationships.

00:30:03.101 --> 00:30:04.202
Bye then.

00:30:06.271 --> 00:30:07.272
Hey.

00:30:09.974 --> 00:30:12.877
You look nice with short hair.

00:30:14.345 --> 00:30:15.547
Yeah?

00:30:16.414 --> 00:30:19.450
Yeah. You had long hair
for a long time.

00:30:20.251 --> 00:30:22.053
It's kind of refreshing.

00:30:22.787 --> 00:30:23.922
I know.

00:30:24.422 --> 00:30:26.658
I think I've never
had my hair this short.

00:30:27.725 --> 00:30:29.460
Did you go to your usual hair salon?

00:30:36.334 --> 00:30:37.402
No.

00:30:38.636 --> 00:30:41.372
I went to a new place
I happened to find.

00:30:42.073 --> 00:30:43.308
I just stopped by.

00:30:43.842 --> 00:30:45.343
I see.

00:30:45.844 --> 00:30:48.379
They're good.
You should go there from now on.

00:30:49.614 --> 00:30:52.116
Yeah, I will.

00:31:00.491 --> 00:31:01.793
That woman...

00:31:03.361 --> 00:31:04.596
She didn't tell him

00:31:05.463 --> 00:31:07.332
that I went to see her?

00:31:10.034 --> 00:31:12.136
YOU HAVE A NEW MESSAGE!

00:31:12.203 --> 00:31:13.204
IS THERE ANYTHING YOU WANT?

00:31:13.271 --> 00:31:14.672
I WANT TO SEE YOU THIS WEEKEND.
JUST THE TWO OF US?

00:31:19.410 --> 00:31:21.246
Wataru, I'm done taking a bath.

00:31:21.813 --> 00:31:24.182
- Can't you at least knock?
- Oh, sorry.

00:31:24.682 --> 00:31:26.584
What? What were you watching?

00:31:26.651 --> 00:31:29.754
- Were you watching something bad?
- No way.

00:31:29.821 --> 00:31:30.955
I'll go take a bath.

00:31:43.868 --> 00:31:45.169
Cologne...

00:31:45.803 --> 00:31:48.539
My son doesn't seem
to be interested at all.

00:31:48.606 --> 00:31:51.276
You never know with those types.

00:31:51.910 --> 00:31:52.944
Excuse me?

00:32:13.164 --> 00:32:14.399
I WANT TO MEET YOU THIS WEEKEND.
JUST THE TWO OF US?

00:32:14.465 --> 00:32:15.600
YES. THERE'S SOMETHING THAT'S BEEN
ON MY MIND.

00:32:23.308 --> 00:32:24.509
Minori?

00:32:30.448 --> 00:32:32.150
You're still up.

00:32:33.184 --> 00:32:34.218
Mm-hmm.

00:32:35.653 --> 00:32:37.188
Were you working?

00:32:38.690 --> 00:32:39.757
Yeah.

00:32:40.258 --> 00:32:43.962
I had to make study plans
for my students.

00:32:49.634 --> 00:32:50.935
Are you

00:32:51.602 --> 00:32:53.538
avoiding me these days?

00:32:56.040 --> 00:32:57.208
Sorry.

00:32:59.210 --> 00:33:01.179
I didn't mean to.

00:33:03.014 --> 00:33:05.850
It's kind of stressful
until I get used to my job.

00:33:08.853 --> 00:33:10.755
I was lonely.

00:33:12.357 --> 00:33:15.660
Don't touch me with those hands
that touched her.

00:33:18.096 --> 00:33:19.230
It's filthy.

00:33:20.732 --> 00:33:22.000
It's gross.

00:33:25.536 --> 00:33:29.440
You can't let him know
until everything is prepared.

00:33:30.208 --> 00:33:32.710
You have to play the part
of a well-loved happy wife.

00:34:08.980 --> 00:34:10.648
I WANT TO MEET YOU THIS WEEKEND.
JUST THE TWO OF US?

00:34:13.618 --> 00:34:15.787
YES. THERE'S SOMETHING THAT'S BEEN
ON MY MIND.

00:34:15.853 --> 00:34:18.189
OKAY. WHERE DO YOU WANT TO GO?

00:34:25.463 --> 00:34:28.499
SOMEWHERE WITH A NICE SCENERY.
LIKE THE SEA?

00:34:28.566 --> 00:34:32.470
RESTAURANT PLAGE SUD
HOW ABOUT MEETING UP THERE?

00:34:36.441 --> 00:34:37.642
THEN I'LL SEE YOU THERE AT 1 P.M.
ALL RIGHT.

00:34:37.708 --> 00:34:40.178
I'LL BE LOOKING FORWARD TO TOMORROW.
I WILL BE TOO.

00:34:48.052 --> 00:34:50.488
I never thought that being held

00:34:51.522 --> 00:34:53.724
by my own husband

00:34:55.059 --> 00:34:56.761
would be this painful.

00:35:00.398 --> 00:35:01.766
Next Tuesday

00:35:03.000 --> 00:35:06.037
he will probably make love
to that woman again.

00:35:15.780 --> 00:35:17.915
Hmm? What's the matter?

00:35:20.518 --> 00:35:21.819
It's nothing.

00:35:23.821 --> 00:35:25.056
That thought made me realize

00:35:27.658 --> 00:35:29.694
how ridiculous this is.

00:35:31.762 --> 00:35:33.498
Somehow the whole thing felt

00:35:34.799 --> 00:35:36.033
a little bit comical.

00:35:38.803 --> 00:35:39.904
Perhaps

00:35:40.404 --> 00:35:42.006
it's too much trouble for you

00:35:42.607 --> 00:35:43.808
to be meeting like this.

00:35:49.847 --> 00:35:50.848
I don't know.

00:35:53.284 --> 00:35:55.953
But it's been a while since
I've been on a date like this.

00:35:56.921 --> 00:36:00.124
Don't you go on a date
with your husband?

00:36:01.859 --> 00:36:03.227
We don't anymore.

00:36:05.029 --> 00:36:06.197
So you're not getting along

00:36:07.465 --> 00:36:08.766
with your husband?

00:36:10.001 --> 00:36:13.404
We do get along.
We're happy with each other.

00:36:18.009 --> 00:36:19.343
Why are you so concerned?

00:36:20.444 --> 00:36:21.445
Uh...

00:36:24.348 --> 00:36:25.516
Wataru's mom...

00:36:26.584 --> 00:36:27.952
aren't you worried?

00:36:30.488 --> 00:36:31.789
I wonder if

00:36:32.690 --> 00:36:34.091
we look like mother and son?

00:36:36.127 --> 00:36:37.562
But we aren't.

00:36:41.098 --> 00:36:43.467
Relax. I'm just kidding.

00:36:47.905 --> 00:36:50.875
Your precious son

00:36:52.476 --> 00:36:53.844
is about to be taken in

00:36:54.979 --> 00:36:56.714
by an evil woman.

00:36:58.416 --> 00:36:59.450
Um...

00:37:02.987 --> 00:37:04.021
That hairstyle.

00:37:04.722 --> 00:37:06.224
It really looks good on you.

00:37:09.493 --> 00:37:10.628
Thank you.

00:37:12.029 --> 00:37:13.097
But...

00:37:14.832 --> 00:37:16.334
I don't think you should

00:37:17.101 --> 00:37:19.370
casually say something
like that to women.

00:37:20.805 --> 00:37:21.839
Huh?

00:37:23.407 --> 00:37:24.942
You might lead them on.

00:37:57.208 --> 00:37:58.509
You have something here...

00:38:27.705 --> 00:38:31.075
I despise your family intensely

00:38:31.142 --> 00:38:33.544
for destroying my home!

00:38:33.611 --> 00:38:36.247
Shouldn't you watch your wife more?

00:38:36.314 --> 00:38:37.915
You're saying he's having an affair?

00:38:37.982 --> 00:38:39.350
Shame on you!

00:38:40.251 --> 00:38:41.819
Apologize to Minori!

00:38:41.952 --> 00:38:43.954
