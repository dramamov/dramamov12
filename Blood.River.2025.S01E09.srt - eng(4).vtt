[Blood River]

00:01:31.620 --> 00:01:33.980
[Based on the novel of the same name from Zhou Munan's Youth in Jianghu series]

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:35.980
[Available on fanqienovel.com & bkneng.com]

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:38.980
[Episode 9]

00:01:43.230 --> 00:01:43.820
Sir.

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:46.050
The Dormant Dragon Sword!

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:56.570
Why is the Dormant Dragon Sword here?

00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:02.020
Each Patriarch of Blood River

00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:04.690
holds two Dormant Dragon Swords.

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:06.180
The two blades

00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:08.940
were forged from the same meteoric iron.

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:10.540
The only difference is,

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:13.100
the one in my hand

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:16.170
hides Blood River's secret.

00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:18.220
The other one is in your hand.

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:21.060
If Su Jinhui can truly wield it,

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:23.170
we'll wait until he quells

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:24.260
the turmoil in Blood River.

00:02:24.710 --> 00:02:25.410
Then,

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:27.010
I will hand this blade

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:28.380
to him as well.

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:30.260
If he cannot,

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:32.820
then that sword

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:35.340
will fully ignite

00:02:35.710 --> 00:02:37.540
the three family heads' ambitions.

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:39.730
And those men

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:41.060
will in the end

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:43.260
be consumed by their own ambition!

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:47.060
Only when they step back

00:02:48.710 --> 00:02:50.610
will the more promising young

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:52.660
have a chance to rise,

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:54.610
a chance

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:58.220
to break free.

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:06.500
[Luojiuxiao Inn]

00:04:00.630 --> 00:04:01.610
Given he's that smart,

00:04:02.870 --> 00:04:04.940
he must know this Fingertip Blade is missing,

00:04:06.190 --> 00:04:07.290
and that I took it.

00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:09.570
But...

00:04:11.150 --> 00:04:12.100
he didn't ask for it back.

00:04:13.960 --> 00:04:14.940
That's tacit approval.

00:04:20.390 --> 00:04:21.170
Then...

00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:26.700
does that make it a token of love?

00:04:36.390 --> 00:04:37.020
You're awake.

00:04:38.630 --> 00:04:39.780
What took you so long to get back?

00:04:40.640 --> 00:04:41.690
You were gone forever.

00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:42.810
I'm starving.

00:04:47.310 --> 00:04:48.580
If you're fine, go down and eat.

00:04:52.240 --> 00:04:53.220
Who says I'm fine?

00:04:55.120 --> 00:04:56.580
I still need someone to look after me.

00:05:22.480 --> 00:05:24.220
I haven't fully recovered.

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:25.850
How about...

00:05:27.510 --> 00:05:28.250
you feed me?

00:05:42.310 --> 00:05:43.700
Why are you so nice to me today?

00:05:44.870 --> 00:05:45.410
Eat properly.

00:05:45.830 --> 00:05:46.490
No talking.

00:05:48.600 --> 00:05:49.290
Got it.

00:05:51.040 --> 00:05:51.700
You...

00:05:53.830 --> 00:05:54.490
you're leaving?

00:05:57.920 --> 00:05:58.980
I was always going to leave.

00:06:00.600 --> 00:06:01.290
Besides,

00:06:03.680 --> 00:06:04.900
you're almost healed.

00:06:57.040 --> 00:06:58.250
You're here.

00:06:59.040 --> 00:07:00.250
You knew I'd come?

00:07:02.720 --> 00:07:04.930
You're a lot like me when I was young.

00:07:06.190 --> 00:07:07.540
When you were young,

00:07:08.600 --> 00:07:09.850
were you already such a piece of work?

00:07:16.160 --> 00:07:17.100
You seem

00:07:17.680 --> 00:07:19.700
to hate showing

00:07:20.430 --> 00:07:22.220
your truest self.

00:07:23.360 --> 00:07:26.170
Afraid of being seen through?

00:07:29.430 --> 00:07:30.850
Before,

00:07:31.680 --> 00:07:33.540
I kept you down,

00:07:34.120 --> 00:07:35.460
and you didn't dare raise your head.

00:07:36.630 --> 00:07:38.850
Now that my edge is gone,

00:07:40.510 --> 00:07:41.730
do you feel

00:07:42.040 --> 00:07:43.930
your chance has come?

00:07:46.310 --> 00:07:47.780
Since you so enjoy

00:07:47.780 --> 00:07:48.470
reading people's minds,

00:07:48.470 --> 00:07:49.580
why not take a guess

00:07:50.800 --> 00:07:51.580
why I came

00:07:52.440 --> 00:07:53.910
and what's my plan?

00:07:54.240 --> 00:07:55.140
You want

00:07:55.720 --> 00:07:58.460
the head of the Su family.

00:08:01.830 --> 00:08:02.700
Su Changhe,

00:08:03.630 --> 00:08:05.700
you're merely the Nameless.

00:08:05.800 --> 00:08:07.810
Nameless Su Muyu

00:08:09.750 --> 00:08:12.850
has no right to inherit the Patriarch.

00:08:13.070 --> 00:08:14.170
You as well

00:08:14.480 --> 00:08:15.610
have no right to inherit

00:08:15.800 --> 00:08:18.220
the head of the Su family.

00:08:24.160 --> 00:08:25.250
So you did look down on me.

00:08:27.560 --> 00:08:29.540
The title of Su family head

00:08:30.750 --> 00:08:32.060
doesn't interest me.

00:08:33.390 --> 00:08:34.100
What I want is something

00:08:35.200 --> 00:08:37.060
Blood River has never seen done

00:08:37.390 --> 00:08:39.010
in past centuries.

00:08:40.510 --> 00:08:41.370
What I aim to achieve

00:08:42.270 --> 00:08:43.370
is a vow

00:08:43.390 --> 00:08:45.100
no one in Blood River could even imagine.

00:08:48.720 --> 00:08:49.460
I...

00:08:50.960 --> 00:08:52.300
will change Blood River.

00:09:02.320 --> 00:09:03.010
Good.

00:09:05.390 --> 00:09:06.130
Changhe,

00:09:07.030 --> 00:09:09.340
your Inch Sword

00:09:09.600 --> 00:09:10.940
is impressive.

00:09:11.960 --> 00:09:13.530
But beating me

00:09:14.670 --> 00:09:15.580
won't be easy.

00:09:18.790 --> 00:09:21.010
My sword may be broken,

00:09:22.080 --> 00:09:22.890
but I

00:09:23.910 --> 00:09:24.850
am still

00:09:25.720 --> 00:09:27.300
Su Jinhui.

00:09:33.320 --> 00:09:34.130
Just a declawed tiger,

00:09:34.750 --> 00:09:35.610
a blind dragon,

00:09:36.670 --> 00:09:37.650
nothing to worry about.

00:09:50.080 --> 00:09:50.980
Nice moves.

00:09:53.600 --> 00:09:54.370
Back then,

00:09:55.080 --> 00:09:56.820
if not for the Su family's help,

00:09:57.480 --> 00:09:59.340
you two would've been dead.

00:10:00.390 --> 00:10:01.340
At Wailing Abyss,

00:10:01.440 --> 00:10:02.460
Muyu carried me out on his back.

00:10:03.080 --> 00:10:04.010
Patriarch took the strike,

00:10:04.200 --> 00:10:05.180
and that was his choice.

00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:10.180
We had no choice

00:10:10.200 --> 00:10:11.180
entering Blood River.

00:10:13.080 --> 00:10:14.940
But we'll step onto the other shore ourselves.

00:10:16.270 --> 00:10:16.890
And you...

00:10:18.080 --> 00:10:19.300
is a relic of the old era.

00:10:24.910 --> 00:10:25.580
You're wounded inside,

00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:26.980
no match for us.

00:10:27.440 --> 00:10:28.450
Su Changli...

00:10:28.600 --> 00:10:29.420
The tide in Blood River

00:10:30.510 --> 00:10:31.340
is turning.

00:10:37.600 --> 00:10:39.010
Uncle Qiu, are you thinking

00:10:40.080 --> 00:10:41.770
it'd be better if the master showed up?

00:10:43.200 --> 00:10:44.400
You've run

00:10:44.400 --> 00:10:45.460
so many celestial-rank missions.

00:10:46.150 --> 00:10:47.220
You never move

00:10:47.630 --> 00:10:49.100
without a sure win.

00:10:50.630 --> 00:10:51.490
I bet

00:10:51.510 --> 00:10:52.730
you've waited long for this.

00:10:53.270 --> 00:10:54.490
And this time,

00:10:55.240 --> 00:10:56.770
the result will be the same as always.

00:10:57.390 --> 00:10:58.890
You really do know me.

00:11:01.030 --> 00:11:02.420
How touching.

00:11:06.480 --> 00:11:08.430
I spent six full years

00:11:08.430 --> 00:11:10.000
gathering this organization.

00:11:10.320 --> 00:11:11.100
Its name...

00:11:12.840 --> 00:11:14.000
is The Other Shore.

00:11:18.550 --> 00:11:19.460
The Other Shore?

00:11:20.790 --> 00:11:22.220
You want to change Blood River?

00:11:22.510 --> 00:11:23.130
That's right.

00:11:24.240 --> 00:11:25.390
Cross Blood River

00:11:25.390 --> 00:11:26.460
and you reach the Other Shore.

00:11:27.720 --> 00:11:29.650
There should be no endless night,

00:11:30.790 --> 00:11:31.890
but light.

00:11:41.870 --> 00:11:43.700
Stirring, isn't it?

00:11:51.840 --> 00:11:53.200
You're one of this family,

00:11:54.080 --> 00:11:55.260
raised from birth

00:11:55.790 --> 00:11:57.630
as an assassin.

00:11:59.390 --> 00:12:00.370
Would anyone truly choose

00:12:00.480 --> 00:12:01.340
to be born

00:12:01.390 --> 00:12:02.940
a tool for killing?

00:12:03.840 --> 00:12:05.490
Why do others bask in sunlight

00:12:06.200 --> 00:12:07.490
while our three families

00:12:08.260 --> 00:12:09.730
must live in darkness?

00:12:11.960 --> 00:12:13.160
Have you really never wanted

00:12:13.160 --> 00:12:14.040
to change that?

00:12:15.200 --> 00:12:16.460
When I was forced as a child

00:12:16.460 --> 00:12:17.640
to learn the killing arts,

00:12:18.240 --> 00:12:19.610
of course I asked those things.

00:12:20.790 --> 00:12:21.980
But after all these years,

00:12:23.030 --> 00:12:23.820
our hands,

00:12:23.870 --> 00:12:25.340
are soaked in blood.

00:12:26.240 --> 00:12:26.940
What right do we have

00:12:27.150 --> 00:12:28.410
to talk of change?

00:12:28.440 --> 00:12:29.010
Exactly.

00:12:31.200 --> 00:12:32.360
Though I see you

00:12:32.360 --> 00:12:33.760
as a fellow traveler,

00:12:34.510 --> 00:12:36.180
I didn't give you this ring.

00:12:37.200 --> 00:12:39.180
Because though you're awake to it,

00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:41.840
you've long lost your nerve.

00:12:44.390 --> 00:12:45.180
We're different.

00:12:46.630 --> 00:12:47.420
We're still young.

00:12:48.440 --> 00:12:50.100
As the storybooks say,

00:12:50.910 --> 00:12:51.850
we're in our prime.

00:12:55.840 --> 00:12:56.560
We haven't strayed far

00:12:56.560 --> 00:12:57.820
from the age

00:12:57.820 --> 00:12:58.700
when blood runs hot.

00:12:59.600 --> 00:13:00.400
We still remember

00:13:00.400 --> 00:13:01.830
that undimmed youth's heart,

00:13:01.830 --> 00:13:02.530
youth's will.

00:13:05.030 --> 00:13:06.370
So long as a young heart

00:13:07.030 --> 00:13:08.580
still beats in our chest,

00:13:09.630 --> 00:13:10.490
we know no fear,

00:13:11.320 --> 00:13:12.010
no regret,

00:13:13.320 --> 00:13:14.100
no surrender.

00:13:28.910 --> 00:13:30.420
Did you kill Master Su?

00:13:31.360 --> 00:13:32.010
Uncle Qiu,

00:13:34.150 --> 00:13:35.060
you're a good man.

00:13:35.910 --> 00:13:37.400
In this filthy, stained

00:13:37.400 --> 00:13:38.170
Blood River,

00:13:38.170 --> 00:13:38.890
you're one of the few

00:13:39.510 --> 00:13:40.700
worthy of respect.

00:13:44.150 --> 00:13:45.060
The new Blood River

00:13:45.270 --> 00:13:46.650
has no place for Su Jinhui.

00:13:49.240 --> 00:13:49.980
He isn't dead.

Take him and leave.

Live well.

00:13:56.600 --> 00:13:57.420
Maybe one day,

00:13:58.240 --> 00:13:59.060
out in the jianghu,

00:13:59.150 --> 00:14:00.420
you'll hear "Blood River"

00:14:02.030 --> 00:14:02.980
and be surprised.

00:14:06.200 --> 00:14:07.010
All right.

00:14:08.720 --> 00:14:09.820
I'll be waiting.

00:14:15.150 --> 00:14:15.980
Farewell, Uncle Qiu.

[Sword Qi Soars]

00:14:46.720 --> 00:14:47.130
Changhe,

00:14:47.390 --> 00:14:48.850
the rest of the Su disciples are secured.

00:14:52.960 --> 00:14:53.980
Why not kill him?

00:14:57.440 --> 00:14:58.060
Yeah.

00:14:59.080 --> 00:14:59.610
Why not?

00:15:00.550 --> 00:15:01.820
What's our next move?

00:15:02.960 --> 00:15:03.820
head to the Mu family,

00:15:04.720 --> 00:15:05.820
and strike when we can?

00:15:06.670 --> 00:15:07.610
Where did Su Muyu go?

00:15:08.390 --> 00:15:09.490
He returned to the Spider's Nest.

00:15:10.510 --> 00:15:11.700
Then we'll go to the Spider's Nest.

00:15:17.440 --> 00:15:18.820
Mu Ciling took the Dormant Dragon Sword.

00:15:19.360 --> 00:15:20.530
It's in Mu hands now.

00:15:21.150 --> 00:15:22.530
What good is the Spider's Nest then?

00:15:23.200 --> 00:15:23.940
The Xie family

00:15:24.440 --> 00:15:25.820
has already ringed the Mu compound.

00:15:26.480 --> 00:15:27.440
Why don't we wait

00:15:27.440 --> 00:15:28.400
until they bleed each other,

00:15:28.400 --> 00:15:29.340
and snatch the Dormant Dragon Sword?

00:15:30.390 --> 00:15:31.580
Since The Other Shore formed,

00:15:32.840 --> 00:15:34.460
we've prepped for this day.

00:15:35.630 --> 00:15:36.940
As our leader,

00:15:37.870 --> 00:15:39.650
you shouldn't play favorites now,

00:15:41.200 --> 00:15:42.650
saving your brother's life.

00:15:46.870 --> 00:15:47.650
What did you say?

00:15:52.480 --> 00:15:53.290
War is upon us.

00:15:53.320 --> 00:15:54.240
Stay calm!

00:15:55.200 --> 00:15:56.340
If you kill me,

00:15:57.200 --> 00:15:58.490
what "new Blood River" is left?

00:15:59.150 --> 00:16:00.100
Do you plan

00:16:00.120 --> 00:16:01.140
to leave the Patriarch's position

00:16:01.140 --> 00:16:01.890
to him?

00:16:05.790 --> 00:16:07.130
Listen closely.

00:16:09.720 --> 00:16:10.980
With Su Muyu's nature,

00:16:11.200 --> 00:16:12.250
unless he's dead,

00:16:13.480 --> 00:16:14.460
he'll stop at nothing

00:16:14.480 --> 00:16:16.100
to run that sword down.

00:16:17.320 --> 00:16:18.090
Since he chose

00:16:18.090 --> 00:16:19.060
to return to the Spider's Nest

00:16:19.080 --> 00:16:20.180
instead of chasing Mu Ciling,

00:16:20.750 --> 00:16:21.500
that means

00:16:21.500 --> 00:16:22.870
there's a problem with that sword.

00:16:25.270 --> 00:16:26.730
Only a fool like Xie Ba

00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:27.940
will fight the Mus

00:16:28.030 --> 00:16:29.250
to the bitter end.

00:16:31.270 --> 00:16:32.700
If you're that stupid,

00:16:33.670 --> 00:16:34.580
then go and join him in death.

00:16:36.510 --> 00:16:37.010

No means no, unless...

Who hired you?

Assassins don't name clients.

00:20:08.000 --> 00:20:08.770
That's the rule.

I can only tell you one thing.

Second Master Tang

Thanks for the reminder.

But I'm still here to kill you

Sir,

00:20:41.550 --> 00:20:43.420
you're in no shape to fight.

00:20:46.400 --> 00:20:48.010
If it's Blood River business,

00:20:48.510 --> 00:20:49.490
so be it.

00:20:51.310 --> 00:20:52.460
But this one

00:20:52.640 --> 00:20:54.490
is only my enemy.

00:20:55.240 --> 00:20:56.460
So I must answer personally.

00:20:57.590 --> 00:20:58.620
Besides,

00:20:58.880 --> 00:21:00.860
the Twelve Zodiacs aren't his match.

00:21:02.720 --> 00:21:05.570
Even a tiger near death

00:21:06.960 --> 00:21:08.250
has its pride,

00:21:09.200 --> 00:21:10.380
and a Patriarch

00:21:11.030 --> 00:21:12.380
his duty.

No one move!

Stand down.

Do we go in now?

00:21:36.640 --> 00:21:37.290
Watch and wait.

00:21:37.880 --> 00:21:38.980
We'll move when Changhe returns.

00:21:40.310 --> 00:21:41.720
Truly my good brother.

00:21:41.830 --> 00:21:43.020
You do know me.

00:21:43.350 --> 00:21:44.410
Right before I do

00:21:44.410 --> 00:21:45.760
the most important thing,

00:21:45.810 --> 00:21:46.960
you asked to meet.

00:21:47.440 --> 00:21:48.380
I have something for you.

00:21:50.160 --> 00:21:51.250
If I may choose,

00:21:51.400 --> 00:21:52.490
I hope it's the Dormant Dragon Sword.

00:21:57.310 --> 00:21:58.330
Go to Tianqi City.

00:21:59.440 --> 00:22:00.960
Set foot there

00:22:01.180 --> 00:22:03.610
and someone will come for you.

00:22:04.240 --> 00:22:05.280
With your skill,

00:22:05.590 --> 00:22:06.810
you can slip past them

00:22:07.350 --> 00:22:08.880
and reach where your secret lies.

00:22:09.750 --> 00:22:10.910
Give these keys

00:22:11.550 --> 00:22:13.250
to the one who guards your secret.

00:22:13.960 --> 00:22:15.090
He will open the boxes

00:22:15.440 --> 00:22:16.650
meant for you

00:22:17.270 --> 00:22:19.410
and Su Changhe.

00:22:20.030 --> 00:22:20.900
From then on,

00:22:22.240 --> 00:22:23.330
your names

00:22:24.590 --> 00:22:25.980
within Blood River

00:22:26.030 --> 00:22:27.050
will be erased forever.

00:22:28.000 --> 00:22:28.530
Also,

00:22:29.110 --> 00:22:30.420
the secret you seek,

00:22:32.240 --> 00:22:34.570
the fall of No-Sword City,

00:22:35.680 --> 00:22:36.860
is inside.

00:22:41.350 --> 00:22:42.530
Is that truly what you want?

00:22:44.830 --> 00:22:45.660
To leave Blood River

00:22:47.270 --> 00:22:48.250
and claim real freedom.

00:22:49.110 --> 00:22:49.810
You fought so hard

00:22:50.000 --> 00:22:50.730
to shield the Patriarch

00:22:51.680 --> 00:22:52.940
just for these two keys?

00:22:56.270 --> 00:22:58.090
The three families' chaos is beyond repair.

00:22:58.920 --> 00:23:00.460
We can dissolve Blood River in the turmoil.

00:23:01.030 --> 00:23:02.700
Then we gain freedom

00:23:03.160 --> 00:23:04.680
and everyone

00:23:04.680 --> 00:23:05.570
gets a choice.

00:23:07.240 --> 00:23:08.770
So that was your plan.

00:23:09.880 --> 00:23:11.140
Use their infighting

00:23:12.070 --> 00:23:13.700
to drain the power-seekers,

00:23:14.920 --> 00:23:15.570
and finally,

00:23:16.270 --> 00:23:16.980
leave Blood River

00:23:16.980 --> 00:23:18.640
with those who think like you.

00:23:23.350 --> 00:23:24.450
Su Muyu.

00:23:26.000 --> 00:23:27.530
You're sharper than I thought.

00:23:30.240 --> 00:23:30.940
But...

00:23:34.680 --> 00:23:35.860
I have a gift

00:23:37.350 --> 00:23:38.140
for you too.

00:23:48.350 --> 00:23:49.090
The Other Shore?

00:23:50.750 --> 00:23:51.570
Cross Blood River

00:23:53.030 --> 00:23:54.010
and you reach the Other Shore.

00:23:56.000 --> 00:23:56.860
There should be

00:23:58.480 --> 00:23:59.420
no endless night,

00:24:00.830 --> 00:24:01.860
but light.

00:24:07.270 --> 00:24:08.470
Remember back then,

00:24:09.400 --> 00:24:10.530
when we finished a mission

00:24:11.030 --> 00:24:12.290
and passed the Canglan River,

00:24:13.440 --> 00:24:14.570
you stared at the water

00:24:14.570 --> 00:24:15.530
and asked me

00:24:16.590 --> 00:24:17.420
a question:

00:24:19.110 --> 00:24:21.010
when would we reach the Other Shore?

00:24:25.790 --> 00:24:27.050
I want to tell you now:

00:24:28.790 --> 00:24:29.730
it's tonight.

00:24:30.720 --> 00:24:31.570
But this night

00:24:33.070 --> 00:24:34.570
will be Blood River's night of blood.

00:24:35.350 --> 00:24:37.180
Blood is where change begins.

00:24:38.200 --> 00:24:38.900
Su Muyu,

00:24:39.720 --> 00:24:40.900
you're too kind.

00:24:41.920 --> 00:24:43.620
Everyone has a bottom line.

00:24:44.270 --> 00:24:46.010
Yours is even higher than my ceiling.

00:24:47.640 --> 00:24:49.120
It vexes me,

00:24:50.750 --> 00:24:52.180
and has for years.

00:24:55.750 --> 00:24:57.070
If you still mean to stop me,

00:24:57.590 --> 00:24:58.660
then let's fight.

00:24:59.640 --> 00:25:00.570
Winner calls it.

00:25:01.440 --> 00:25:02.090
If you win,

00:25:02.720 --> 00:25:03.860
I'll dissolve Blood River with you.

00:25:04.830 --> 00:25:05.530
If I win,

00:25:06.790 --> 00:25:07.770
you'll walk with me to the other shore.

00:25:08.350 --> 00:25:09.180
Changhe,

00:25:10.240 --> 00:25:11.770
no one knows you better than I do.

00:25:14.480 --> 00:25:16.140
You may lead Blood River to the light,

00:25:17.720 --> 00:25:18.730
but your ambition

00:25:19.240 --> 00:25:21.090
will also drive many into the abyss.

00:25:21.920 --> 00:25:22.600
And Blood River

00:25:22.600 --> 00:25:24.180
is not as simple as you think.

00:25:25.440 --> 00:25:27.220
Behind the Patriarch and the Soul Reapers' Hall,

00:25:28.350 --> 00:25:29.980
there's a stronger hand.

00:25:31.350 --> 00:25:32.250
Stronger?

00:25:32.960 --> 00:25:33.570
Yes.

00:25:35.200 --> 00:25:36.240
Even if we become

00:25:36.350 --> 00:25:38.250
Patriarch and head of the Su family,

00:25:39.110 --> 00:25:40.700
we won't rule it all.

00:25:41.270 --> 00:25:42.570
Even the Patriarch

00:25:43.680 --> 00:25:45.700
is just a blade in someone else's hand.

00:25:49.680 --> 00:25:51.440
If we can found a new Blood River,

00:25:53.070 --> 00:25:53.900
then that Blood River

00:25:54.200 --> 00:25:55.380
belongs only to the two of us.

00:25:56.790 --> 00:25:57.770
That hidden hand

00:25:58.400 --> 00:25:59.860
and those stubborn family heads

00:26:01.070 --> 00:26:02.840
will be cut down in the end.

00:26:03.550 --> 00:26:04.290
Su Muyu,

00:26:05.960 --> 00:26:07.380
when did you grow so timid?

00:26:11.110 --> 00:26:11.980
To stand against them,

00:26:12.830 --> 00:26:13.810
many will die,

00:26:14.830 --> 00:26:16.050
and the price will be heavy.

00:26:18.000 --> 00:26:18.980
I want them

00:26:19.160 --> 00:26:20.290
to survive.

00:26:21.000 --> 00:26:21.900
As you said,

00:26:23.680 --> 00:26:24.810
I'm an ambitious man.

00:26:26.440 --> 00:26:27.010
Unlike you,

00:26:28.070 --> 00:26:29.570
a free spirit.

00:26:31.000 --> 00:26:31.700
Su Muyu,

00:26:33.680 --> 00:26:34.490
we've always walked

00:26:34.550 --> 00:26:35.530
different paths!

00:26:49.680 --> 00:26:50.570
You say you'll be a good man

00:26:50.640 --> 00:26:51.530
in Blood River.

00:26:52.200 --> 00:26:53.010
That's naive.

00:26:55.200 --> 00:26:56.810
Those you won't kill, I'll kill.

00:26:57.510 --> 00:26:58.890
The sins you won't bear,

00:26:58.890 --> 00:26:59.870
I'll bear.

00:27:00.750 --> 00:27:01.980
Even if you want to leave Blood River,

00:27:03.750 --> 00:27:04.860
I'll pave the road for you.

00:27:06.550 --> 00:27:07.570
But if you die,

00:27:09.030 --> 00:27:10.220
I won't see you off,

00:27:13.790 --> 00:27:15.180
even if they call me the Undertaker.

00:27:18.400 --> 00:27:19.180
Do you remember

00:27:19.350 --> 00:27:20.490
what I told you

00:27:22.070 --> 00:27:23.250
when we escaped Wailing Abyss?

00:27:25.920 --> 00:27:27.050
If you're strong enough,

00:27:29.070 --> 00:27:30.140
you earn the right to be naive.

00:27:38.310 --> 00:27:39.140
And now,

00:27:42.070 --> 00:27:43.860
aren't I naive in my own way?

00:27:48.480 --> 00:27:49.450
Sword Deity Xueyue,

00:27:50.270 --> 00:27:51.360
what do you think?

00:27:54.400 --> 00:27:55.170
City Lord Li.

00:27:55.830 --> 00:27:56.990
Long time no see,

00:27:57.110 --> 00:27:57.860
Su Muyu.

00:27:59.590 --> 00:28:00.590
My junior says

00:28:00.910 --> 00:28:02.940
a new Patriarch in Blood River

00:28:03.070 --> 00:28:04.140
will shake the jianghu,

00:28:04.880 --> 00:28:06.530
so he invited me to judge.

00:28:07.680 --> 00:28:08.330
He says

00:28:09.200 --> 00:28:10.140
you're the best choice

00:28:10.960 --> 00:28:12.290
for Patriarch.

00:28:12.960 --> 00:28:14.240
Once I kill Mu Mingce,

00:28:14.350 --> 00:28:15.300
take the Dormant Dragon Sword,

00:28:15.960 --> 00:28:17.100
and unite the three families,

00:28:17.480 --> 00:28:18.460
he'll take it, want it or not.

00:28:23.720 --> 00:28:24.290
I believe you.

00:28:25.240 --> 00:28:26.360
Cruel as you can be,

00:28:26.960 --> 00:28:28.140
you keep your word.

00:28:29.640 --> 00:28:30.620
You've got a good eye.

00:28:31.510 --> 00:28:32.330
Hold him off for me.

00:28:32.830 --> 00:28:33.530
I'll handle business.

00:28:34.070 --> 00:28:35.140
But now I see

00:28:36.200 --> 00:28:37.250
an even better end.

00:28:37.830 --> 00:28:38.460
What?

00:28:39.680 --> 00:28:40.760
What Su Muyu said:

00:28:41.440 --> 00:28:42.480
dissolve Blood River.

00:28:43.400 --> 00:28:44.990
A jianghu without Blood River

00:28:46.400 --> 00:28:47.570
is truly best.

00:28:48.240 --> 00:28:48.940
Excellent.

00:28:54.920 --> 00:28:55.620
Trouble at the Nest.

00:28:56.350 --> 00:28:56.900
Changhe,

00:28:57.440 --> 00:28:58.440
your men acted?

00:28:59.300 --> 00:29:00.020
Without me,

00:29:00.310 --> 00:29:01.250
they wouldn't dare.

00:29:02.110 --> 00:29:02.860
It was Tang Lianyue.

00:29:03.480 --> 00:29:05.090
He's got his own vendetta.

00:29:14.440 --> 00:29:15.620
Skywrath Thunder!

00:29:16.200 --> 00:29:17.810
Shame the sky's clear tonight,

00:29:18.440 --> 00:29:19.570
or I'd call lightning down,

00:29:20.550 --> 00:29:21.250
and Sir,

00:29:21.920 --> 00:29:23.220
you'd already be dead.

00:29:36.310 --> 00:29:37.010
Sir.

00:29:38.200 --> 00:29:39.940
A blade is forged by grinding,

00:29:40.270 --> 00:29:42.010
and plum scent by bitter cold.

00:29:42.400 --> 00:29:43.140
That poison

00:29:43.400 --> 00:29:44.420
has one distinct trait:

00:29:45.000 --> 00:29:45.530
a resilience

00:29:45.680 --> 00:29:46.810
like the plum blossom.

00:29:47.680 --> 00:29:48.570
Even with antidote,

00:29:49.270 --> 00:29:50.860
if you stir inner force too soon,

00:29:51.200 --> 00:29:52.290
it'll surge back.

00:29:54.350 --> 00:29:55.180
Looks like

00:29:55.350 --> 00:29:56.010
the poison has relapsed.

00:29:56.400 --> 00:29:57.330
No need for me to strike,

00:29:58.200 --> 00:29:59.380
you'll die soon anyway.

00:30:01.110 --> 00:30:02.330
Freshly cured,

00:30:03.000 --> 00:30:03.730
after this fight,

00:30:04.270 --> 00:30:05.250
not even deities can save you.

00:30:06.110 --> 00:30:06.810
In that case,

00:30:07.590 --> 00:30:08.730
I'll take my leave.

00:30:09.270 --> 00:30:10.050
Sir, fare well

00:30:11.830 --> 00:30:13.570
on your way to the Underworld.

00:30:18.720 --> 00:30:19.250
Sir,

00:30:19.350 --> 00:30:20.660
we must treat it now.

00:30:22.920 --> 00:30:23.690
No need.

00:30:24.590 --> 00:30:26.040
I can feel

00:30:27.790 --> 00:30:29.180
my end is near.

00:30:30.550 --> 00:30:32.160
Even an immortal

00:30:33.750 --> 00:30:36.090
can't reverse it.

00:30:37.510 --> 00:30:38.220
Miracle physician,

00:30:39.270 --> 00:30:40.380
is there any other way?

00:30:41.830 --> 00:30:42.670
Freshly cleared of poison,

00:30:42.960 --> 00:30:44.460
he shouldn't have stirred the inner force.

00:30:45.070 --> 00:30:46.180
He could've lived a few more years.

00:30:47.680 --> 00:30:48.490
But just now...

00:30:49.200 --> 00:30:51.580
No need to blame yourself.

00:30:52.200 --> 00:30:53.810
My sins run deep.

00:30:54.440 --> 00:30:56.460
Even in the Underworld,

00:30:56.510 --> 00:30:57.660
before Yama,

00:30:58.270 --> 00:30:59.380
he'd judge me

00:31:00.200 --> 00:31:03.810
beyond saving.

00:31:05.110 --> 00:31:05.860
Sir...

00:31:11.510 --> 00:31:12.050
Muyu,

00:31:13.030 --> 00:31:13.860
Changhe,

00:31:15.240 --> 00:31:16.570
come with me.

00:31:17.920 --> 00:31:19.140
I have words for you.

00:31:20.400 --> 00:31:21.400
The rest of you,

00:31:21.880 --> 00:31:22.970
wait here.

00:31:23.480 --> 00:31:24.250
Understood.

00:31:41.510 --> 00:31:42.140
Muyu,

00:31:43.550 --> 00:31:44.800
I always thought

00:31:44.880 --> 00:31:46.980
you risked everything to protect me

00:31:48.400 --> 00:31:50.530
because of the Life-Death Contract.

00:31:51.270 --> 00:31:52.090
What contract?

00:31:53.310 --> 00:31:53.900
No matter.

00:31:54.680 --> 00:31:55.380
It's already undone.

00:31:56.960 --> 00:31:58.620
I used to think

00:32:00.000 --> 00:32:02.260
the world had cast me aside,

00:32:03.110 --> 00:32:04.950
until the day I learned

00:32:05.640 --> 00:32:07.290
you'd already cured the Life-Death Contract.

00:32:08.400 --> 00:32:09.420
I suddenly realized

00:32:09.960 --> 00:32:11.330
I'd underestimated you

00:32:12.680 --> 00:32:14.250
and myself.

00:32:15.310 --> 00:32:17.050
These years, I stayed by you

00:32:18.030 --> 00:32:18.940
because I believed

00:32:20.680 --> 00:32:21.860
you were worth guarding.

00:32:24.720 --> 00:32:25.290
Good.

00:32:27.000 --> 00:32:27.770
Very good.

00:32:28.790 --> 00:32:29.940
When I was young,

00:32:31.110 --> 00:32:32.810
Kewen and I were like brothers,

00:32:34.200 --> 00:32:35.700
like you and Changhe.

00:32:37.240 --> 00:32:39.510
Later, fighting for the Patriarch's position,

00:32:40.350 --> 00:32:41.570
I lost much.

00:32:42.590 --> 00:32:43.900
And Kewen alone

00:32:44.920 --> 00:32:45.980
came to this Spider's Nest.

00:32:48.830 --> 00:32:49.940
I thought

00:32:50.750 --> 00:32:51.940
he'd abandoned me too,

00:32:53.160 --> 00:32:53.860
yet in the end

00:32:55.550 --> 00:32:56.290
he gave his life

00:32:57.640 --> 00:32:59.430
to save me.

00:33:05.590 --> 00:33:06.330
Sadly,

00:33:07.720 --> 00:33:08.380
some things

00:33:09.550 --> 00:33:10.530
don't change,

00:33:13.270 --> 00:33:14.220
ever.

00:33:17.400 --> 00:33:18.010
Muyu,

00:33:20.200 --> 00:33:22.210
you have your own plan, don't you?

00:33:23.110 --> 00:33:24.290
Your ultimate aim

00:33:25.030 --> 00:33:26.290
is to dissolve Blood River,

00:33:27.310 --> 00:33:27.980
right?

00:33:30.110 --> 00:33:30.730
Yes.

00:33:31.830 --> 00:33:33.220
If I leave alone,

00:33:34.720 --> 00:33:36.420
those of the Spider Shadow won't meet a good end.

00:33:37.830 --> 00:33:38.710
I don't want them

00:33:38.710 --> 00:33:39.980
living in killing every day.

00:33:41.830 --> 00:33:42.810
Only by disbanding Blood River

00:33:44.750 --> 00:33:46.420
can they gain real freedom,

00:33:48.000 --> 00:33:49.130
live like ordinary folk

00:33:49.920 --> 00:33:51.460
and walk in the sun.

00:33:53.720 --> 00:33:55.460
If Blood River scatters like rain,

00:33:57.070 --> 00:33:59.090
no matter how strong those powers are,

00:34:01.070 --> 00:34:02.380
it won't matter.

00:34:07.110 --> 00:34:07.730
And you,

00:34:08.360 --> 00:34:08.980
Changhe?

00:34:09.630 --> 00:34:11.490
You want to command Blood River

00:34:12.480 --> 00:34:13.380
to change it,

00:34:13.920 --> 00:34:14.530
right?

00:34:15.230 --> 00:34:16.740
There's much I want to change.

00:34:18.360 --> 00:34:19.820
This is only a start.

00:34:28.510 --> 00:34:30.380
I can hand you this sword,

00:34:33.030 --> 00:34:34.130
though I'd rather

00:34:35.400 --> 00:34:36.530
give it to Muyu.

00:34:43.190 --> 00:34:44.300
When I was young,

00:34:45.760 --> 00:34:47.650
I thought as you do.

00:34:48.550 --> 00:34:49.570
But for now,

00:34:50.280 --> 00:34:51.340
you don't yet know.

00:34:52.000 --> 00:34:52.900
The cause you seek to achieve

00:34:53.360 --> 00:34:54.490
will be far harder

00:34:55.070 --> 00:34:56.300
than you imagine.

00:34:57.630 --> 00:34:58.690
The ones you must defeat

00:34:59.230 --> 00:35:00.490
aren't just Su Jinhui,

00:35:01.070 --> 00:35:02.130
nor only me,

00:35:04.840 --> 00:35:07.110
but ones stronger than us

00:35:07.150 --> 00:35:09.190
and many times more fearsome.

00:35:09.760 --> 00:35:11.090
Together, Su Muyu and I

00:35:11.150 --> 00:35:12.370
have yet to lose.

00:35:13.550 --> 00:35:14.940
The Soul Reapers' Hall

00:35:16.070 --> 00:35:17.050
isn't worth a mention.

00:35:18.630 --> 00:35:19.870
The Soul Reapers' Hall

00:35:21.590 --> 00:35:22.610
is only a puppet

00:35:23.110 --> 00:35:25.050
they planted in Blood River.

00:35:26.640 --> 00:35:28.050
For centuries,

00:35:28.360 --> 00:35:29.710
all know

00:35:30.000 --> 00:35:31.440
Blood River is the most fearsome

00:35:31.440 --> 00:35:33.330
under heaven.

00:35:33.840 --> 00:35:35.540
But the truth of it

00:35:36.960 --> 00:35:39.010
is hid even from its

00:35:40.030 --> 00:35:40.860
own killers

00:35:41.590 --> 00:35:42.940
Then what is the true face

00:35:44.440 --> 00:35:45.380
of Blood River?

00:35:46.920 --> 00:35:48.310
The truth

00:35:49.150 --> 00:35:51.840
can't be told in a few words.

00:35:52.190 --> 00:35:52.940
The secret hides

00:35:53.800 --> 00:35:55.740
in the secret passage in my room.

00:35:56.320 --> 00:35:57.380
After I'm gone,

00:35:57.760 --> 00:35:58.860
you're free to see it.

00:36:00.110 --> 00:36:01.780
But even if you don't,

00:36:02.400 --> 00:36:03.440
when you finally wield

00:36:04.590 --> 00:36:07.110
this Dormant Dragon Sword,

00:36:08.110 --> 00:36:10.420
they'll come for you.

00:36:19.230 --> 00:36:19.860
The sword's here.

00:36:21.230 --> 00:36:22.610
I leave it to you two.

00:36:24.960 --> 00:36:25.610
Sir...

00:36:36.030 --> 00:36:36.650
Muyu,

00:36:39.230 --> 00:36:40.210
I've always felt this way.

00:36:43.510 --> 00:36:45.650
Since I became Patriarch,

00:36:46.710 --> 00:36:47.340
I held

00:36:48.510 --> 00:36:51.520
Blood River's highest power

00:36:52.070 --> 00:36:53.120
and glory.

00:36:55.070 --> 00:36:56.510
But I was like a ghost

00:36:56.510 --> 00:36:58.690
cast aside by the three families.

00:37:00.000 --> 00:37:01.300
Only days ago,

00:37:02.630 --> 00:37:04.420
seeing Kewen die for me,

00:37:08.190 --> 00:37:09.010
seeing you

00:37:10.510 --> 00:37:12.090
choose to shield me

00:37:12.190 --> 00:37:14.090
even after my poison was cleared,

00:37:18.230 --> 00:37:19.090
did I realize

00:37:22.630 --> 00:37:24.300
I was never alone.

00:37:26.840 --> 00:37:27.460
Muyu,

00:37:30.190 --> 00:37:31.530
thanks for staying by my side

00:37:33.320 --> 00:37:34.260
all these years.

00:37:40.030 --> 00:37:41.210
If not for your kindness back then,

00:37:41.800 --> 00:37:42.420
the two of us

00:37:42.590 --> 00:37:43.570
would never have left Wailing Abyss.

00:37:54.550 --> 00:37:55.380
Back then,

00:37:57.190 --> 00:37:58.340
I only meant to use

00:37:58.360 --> 00:38:00.010
the strength you two had.

00:38:00.960 --> 00:38:01.900
Your original aim,

00:38:03.670 --> 00:38:04.880
our ending,

00:38:05.070 --> 00:38:06.400
and the final choice,

00:38:06.760 --> 00:38:08.460
they're not the same thing.

00:38:11.440 --> 00:38:12.870
I learned skills in Blood River,

00:38:13.630 --> 00:38:14.980
and how to be a man from my father.

00:38:16.550 --> 00:38:17.490
My father taught me

00:38:19.840 --> 00:38:21.090
loyalty comes first.

00:38:26.710 --> 00:38:27.740
Loyalty...

00:38:31.800 --> 00:38:32.980
When I was young,

00:38:33.920 --> 00:38:34.860
I also wanted to found

00:38:34.880 --> 00:38:36.300
a different Blood River.

00:38:39.150 --> 00:38:40.530
But later I found

00:38:41.710 --> 00:38:42.860
I was turning

00:38:43.880 --> 00:38:45.300
into one of them.

00:38:49.320 --> 00:38:50.090
And you,

00:38:50.510 --> 00:38:51.420
Su Muyu,

00:38:52.960 --> 00:38:54.050
you're someone

00:38:54.670 --> 00:38:56.090
who never changes.

00:39:03.190 --> 00:39:03.900
Leave.

00:39:05.800 --> 00:39:06.460
Leave.

00:39:09.000 --> 00:39:09.940
Once you're gone,

00:39:10.920 --> 00:39:12.380
I'll set a great fire

00:39:14.000 --> 00:39:15.980
and burn myself and this Nest

00:39:16.840 --> 00:39:18.690
to ash.

00:39:20.110 --> 00:39:20.980
Say no more.

00:39:21.590 --> 00:39:22.980
This is my choice.

00:39:33.360 --> 00:39:34.170
Sir...

00:39:38.150 --> 00:39:39.170
may you find bliss beyond.

00:39:49.840 --> 00:39:51.260
I thought you'd urge me

00:39:52.360 --> 00:39:54.130
to seek the miracle physician again.

00:39:55.550 --> 00:39:56.170
Everyone has

00:39:56.360 --> 00:39:57.300
their choice.

00:39:59.230 --> 00:40:00.050
And every choice

00:40:02.150 --> 00:40:03.380
has its meaning.

00:40:12.190 --> 00:40:13.900
I'll surely fall into hell,

00:40:15.960 --> 00:40:17.130
so I hope

00:40:18.360 --> 00:40:19.380
we never meet again.

00:40:35.840 --> 00:40:37.260
It's been a while. No action yet?

00:40:38.030 --> 00:40:38.650
Could the boss have...

00:40:40.760 --> 00:40:41.260
Someone's heading in.

00:40:41.550 --> 00:40:42.900
Changhe said, wait for his word.

00:40:44.030 --> 00:40:44.940
Then whatever happens,

00:40:44.960 --> 00:40:46.050
we don't act on our own.

00:40:51.440 --> 00:40:52.090
In this world,

00:40:52.920 --> 00:40:54.130
you're the only one

00:40:54.510 --> 00:40:55.260
I'll give this sword to.

00:40:57.760 --> 00:40:58.530
Honestly, I think

00:40:59.550 --> 00:41:00.570
you'll find it easier

00:41:00.590 --> 00:41:01.420
to win support.

00:41:02.230 --> 00:41:03.570
The Twelve Zodiacs of Spider Shadow

00:41:03.590 --> 00:41:04.460
can die for you, after all.

00:41:04.760 --> 00:41:05.900
While The Other Shore lot

00:41:06.400 --> 00:41:07.420
only draw steel on me.

00:41:08.400 --> 00:41:09.570
As we agreed:

00:41:10.000 --> 00:41:10.780
you be Patriarch,

00:41:11.150 --> 00:41:12.260
and I'll head the Su family.

00:41:18.000 --> 00:41:18.530
Figures.

00:41:19.960 --> 00:41:20.940
Even if I yield to you,

00:41:20.960 --> 00:41:21.650
you still won't take it.

00:41:22.320 --> 00:41:22.980
Every moment

00:41:23.030 --> 00:41:24.300
you want to leave this place,

00:41:24.670 --> 00:41:26.730
cut ties with Blood River.

00:41:29.360 --> 00:41:31.040
Why do you insist on staying?

00:41:31.760 --> 00:41:32.570
Because not everyone

00:41:32.590 --> 00:41:34.160
is wantless like you.

00:41:35.510 --> 00:41:36.740
Some want to be heroes,

00:41:37.960 --> 00:41:39.170
some, knights-errant.

00:41:40.550 --> 00:41:41.490
Some want

00:41:41.490 --> 00:41:42.930
great wealth,

00:41:43.470 --> 00:41:45.340
some want a famous name.

00:41:45.960 --> 00:41:47.400
Blood River is strong.

00:41:48.630 --> 00:41:49.950
Together,

00:41:50.280 --> 00:41:51.940
we can make and change so much.

00:41:53.000 --> 00:41:53.780
I have ambition,

00:41:54.400 --> 00:41:55.650
and they have desires.

00:41:56.710 --> 00:41:57.980
Better than wandering the world,

00:41:58.070 --> 00:41:59.300
grip the sword in your hand

00:42:00.190 --> 00:42:00.980
and fight to the end

00:42:01.000 --> 00:42:02.340
against those bad guys

00:42:03.150 --> 00:42:04.260
who'd rule our fate.

00:42:12.760 --> 00:42:13.940
Well said!

00:42:14.360 --> 00:42:15.610
Kill them all,

00:42:16.320 --> 00:42:17.940
and you'll purge this poison for me?

00:42:18.630 --> 00:42:19.010
Yes.

00:42:19.840 --> 00:42:21.340
They're the Su family's

00:42:21.360 --> 00:42:22.570
two strongest:

00:42:22.880 --> 00:42:23.900
Su Muyu

00:42:24.510 --> 00:42:25.980
and Su Changhe.

00:42:26.880 --> 00:42:27.860
You're Water Official

00:42:28.320 --> 00:42:28.980
of the Soul Reapers' Hall?

00:42:29.630 --> 00:42:31.420
Your speech just now was well put.

00:42:32.190 --> 00:42:33.420
Only a pity.

00:42:34.190 --> 00:42:34.860
What's the pity?

00:42:35.440 --> 00:42:36.130
A pity...

00:42:37.670 --> 00:42:39.380
you aren't the one we chose.

00:42:40.480 --> 00:42:41.280
Don't worry.

00:42:41.710 --> 00:42:42.690
I won't step in.

00:42:43.280 --> 00:42:44.400
As one of the Three Officials,

00:42:44.590 --> 00:42:45.420
I prefer to watch

00:42:45.420 --> 00:42:47.440
from the sidelines.

00:42:48.000 --> 00:42:49.260
Strong as you are,

00:42:50.590 --> 00:42:51.570
you still won't

00:42:51.590 --> 00:42:52.860
be a match for Mu Ciling.

00:42:53.800 --> 00:42:54.690
I disagree with much

00:42:54.710 --> 00:42:55.900
of what Changhe said,

00:42:57.190 --> 00:42:58.380
but one thing

00:42:59.400 --> 00:43:00.260
was no empty talk:

00:43:01.920 --> 00:43:03.010
together, the two of us

00:43:03.670 --> 00:43:04.860
have never lost.

00:43:05.800 --> 00:43:06.420
Eighteen-Sword Array,

00:43:06.670 --> 00:43:07.050
activate!

00:43:12.140 --> 00:43:15.620
