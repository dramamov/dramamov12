ADAPTED FROM BAI LU CHENG SHUANG'S
LOVE IN THE CLOUDS

00:01:30.785 --> 00:01:34.025
EPISODE 27

00:01:41.385 --> 00:01:43.225
-Show me your hand.
-What for?

00:01:43.745 --> 00:01:44.945
I didn't do anything wrong today.

00:01:45.705 --> 00:01:48.545
If I wanted to hit you,
would I go for your hand?

00:02:02.585 --> 00:02:04.785
-What is it?
-Strange.

00:02:05.985 --> 00:02:07.585
After your trip to Zhangwei Mountain,

00:02:07.665 --> 00:02:10.385
the Heavenly Grief in
you stopped spreading.

00:02:11.665 --> 00:02:13.905
Sometimes I can't even detect it at all.

00:02:15.505 --> 00:02:17.505
-Now this hand.
-Really?

00:02:19.305 --> 00:02:21.025
Could the feng shui at
the Bo clan's ancestral home

00:02:21.105 --> 00:02:22.825
have somehow helped me?

00:02:25.745 --> 00:02:27.145
You might be right.

00:02:29.345 --> 00:02:30.225
The Bo clan

00:02:30.305 --> 00:02:32.945
created both the Heavenly Grief
and the Golden Millet Dream.

00:02:33.025 --> 00:02:34.825
And Fairy Bo herself was your…

00:02:35.625 --> 00:02:36.465
My what?

00:02:37.825 --> 00:02:38.665
Your benefactor,

00:02:40.025 --> 00:02:40.945
of course.

00:02:41.025 --> 00:02:43.225
She gave
you the Golden Millet Dream recipe.

00:02:43.305 --> 00:02:45.905
Even if we still need to
find the Diwu tree's core,

00:02:45.985 --> 00:02:48.425
the fact that she gave you the recipe
already makes her your benefactor.

00:02:52.585 --> 00:02:55.985
It's a pity Ji Bozai destroyed
the Golden Millet Dream.

00:02:56.065 --> 00:02:57.225
Otherwise…

00:02:57.305 --> 00:02:59.625
It's not over yet.

00:02:59.705 --> 00:03:02.385
Though the Diwu tree's
core hasn't been seen for ages,

00:03:02.465 --> 00:03:04.225
the Bo clan still managed to make

00:03:04.305 --> 00:03:06.505
the Golden Millet Dream and
the Heavenly Grief a century ago.

00:03:06.585 --> 00:03:09.305
Since the Golden Millet Dream Ji Bozai had
was made by Fairy Bo Yulan,

00:03:09.385 --> 00:03:11.025
she must have found a core.

00:03:11.985 --> 00:03:13.825
That's my disciple. Smart as ever.

00:03:13.905 --> 00:03:15.705
If they could find it, why can't we?

00:03:16.705 --> 00:03:18.825
What matters most is the Diwu tree's core.

00:03:18.905 --> 00:03:21.985
The rest of the ingredients,
like Ostrich Rat, mesona,

00:03:22.065 --> 00:03:23.305
and turtle shells,

00:03:23.385 --> 00:03:24.225
are easy to get.

00:03:25.545 --> 00:03:27.385
Ming Yi, don't worry.

00:03:27.465 --> 00:03:30.345
-With me here, there's nothing to fear.
-I know.

00:03:30.425 --> 00:03:31.385
When you're here, Master,

00:03:31.465 --> 00:03:33.265
I feel safer
than when my father was around.

00:03:39.545 --> 00:03:40.585
What's wrong?

00:03:44.825 --> 00:03:46.985
You're getting more sentimental

00:03:47.065 --> 00:03:49.105
with age, aren't you?

00:03:49.185 --> 00:03:51.465
If you want to cry, go ahead.
Here, my shoulder's free.

00:03:54.345 --> 00:03:56.265
What are you doing? I'm your master.

00:03:56.345 --> 00:03:57.505
Show some respect.

00:03:59.105 --> 00:04:02.545
If we really manage to
make the Golden Millet Dream,

00:04:02.625 --> 00:04:04.545
I'll not only reenter
the Qingyun Tournament,

00:04:04.625 --> 00:04:06.345
but I'll also win
it for another seven years.

00:04:08.985 --> 00:04:11.505
Is this the time
to be thinking about that?

00:04:14.585 --> 00:04:15.745
But you're right.

00:04:16.425 --> 00:04:17.345
No matter how hard it is,

00:04:18.585 --> 00:04:19.785
we'll find those ingredients.

00:04:21.184 --> 00:04:24.825
I can't stand
watching you suffer any longer.

00:04:30.465 --> 00:04:31.905
Show some respect.

00:04:33.025 --> 00:04:34.385
You cheeky brat.

00:04:39.225 --> 00:04:41.905
The last ingredient for the Golden
Millet Dream is the Diwu tree's core?

00:04:43.385 --> 00:04:44.665
How could we possibly find that?

00:04:45.385 --> 00:04:47.265
The Diwu tree's core
has vanished from the world,

00:04:49.025 --> 00:04:50.985
but I can't just watch her die.

00:04:52.905 --> 00:04:53.945
Fuyue,

00:04:54.465 --> 00:04:57.385
the Yousu Fox Tribe can seal a primordial
spirit within an Illusory Realm,

00:04:58.545 --> 00:05:00.705
which is considered a form of immortality.

00:05:01.825 --> 00:05:02.905
So I wonder,

00:05:03.905 --> 00:05:04.985
could this technique

00:05:06.105 --> 00:05:07.945
be used to keep Ming Yi alive for now?

00:05:10.625 --> 00:05:11.985
Have you lost your mind, Your Lordship?

00:05:12.905 --> 00:05:14.105
You know full well

00:05:14.185 --> 00:05:16.705
that using the technique like that

00:05:16.785 --> 00:05:20.265
inflicts burning pain to the bone.
One mistake,

00:05:20.785 --> 00:05:23.865
and you'll lose your mind completely!

00:05:23.945 --> 00:05:25.785
You're only talking
about the consequences.

00:05:27.065 --> 00:05:28.505
That means

00:05:29.985 --> 00:05:31.825
the method itself can work.

00:05:32.345 --> 00:05:33.625
Am I right?

00:05:42.865 --> 00:05:44.065
-Please…
-Your Lordship!

00:05:50.145 --> 00:05:51.505
Please.

00:05:54.705 --> 00:05:55.945
I'm begging you.

00:05:57.585 --> 00:05:58.705
Your Lordship.

00:06:07.145 --> 00:06:10.385
This fox spell can lure
souls into an Illusory Realm.

00:06:10.905 --> 00:06:13.745
It can strip a being of
their three souls and seven senses

00:06:13.825 --> 00:06:15.105
and weave an Illusory Realm.

00:06:15.865 --> 00:06:18.265
Within that Illusory Realm,
the spell can be reversed

00:06:18.785 --> 00:06:22.385
to extend her life with
someone else's lifespan.

00:06:22.465 --> 00:06:25.105
I can capture some
wandering spirits without families.

00:06:25.185 --> 00:06:27.785
They have no ties in this world.

00:06:27.865 --> 00:06:31.065
Killing them won't cause any trouble.

00:06:31.145 --> 00:06:32.425
We can't do that.

00:06:32.505 --> 00:06:35.585
If I stain my hands
with the blood of the innocent,

00:06:35.665 --> 00:06:37.665
Ming Yi will never forgive me,

00:06:37.745 --> 00:06:39.625
and I'll lose any
chance of a future with her.

00:06:39.705 --> 00:06:40.745
Even now,

00:06:41.385 --> 00:06:43.065
Your Lordship still can't bring yourself

00:06:43.145 --> 00:06:45.105
to lie to her?

00:06:45.185 --> 00:06:46.745
This is my only wish.

00:06:47.625 --> 00:06:48.785
I have deceived her before

00:06:49.425 --> 00:06:51.385
and done many things I can never undo.

00:06:51.905 --> 00:06:52.905
But in the end,

00:06:53.705 --> 00:06:55.665
I must become someone like her

00:06:56.265 --> 00:06:58.505
to be worthy of standing by her side.

00:07:45.105 --> 00:07:49.585
Three souls and seven
senses, enter the endless Illusory Realm.

00:07:50.585 --> 00:07:56.105
Burn the heart and refine the blood.
Cross the heavens and the netherworld.

00:07:56.185 --> 00:07:58.225
With my bare body and organs,

00:07:58.825 --> 00:08:00.225
I offer all my life's fortune

00:08:01.225 --> 00:08:02.825
to lengthen her years

00:08:03.345 --> 00:08:04.865
and extend her life.

00:08:20.545 --> 00:08:22.305
-Ming Yi!
-Immortal Situ.

00:08:23.105 --> 00:08:24.825
I found a way to save you.

00:08:24.905 --> 00:08:25.985
Take this medicine.

00:08:26.585 --> 00:08:27.425
What is it?

00:08:27.505 --> 00:08:29.225
Ming Yi, just take it.

00:08:29.305 --> 00:08:30.785
Tell me what it is.

00:08:42.065 --> 00:08:45.625
I learned a technique
that refines the blood of my heart.

00:08:45.705 --> 00:08:47.185
This way,

00:08:47.865 --> 00:08:50.865
I can trade my lifespan for your time.

00:08:52.225 --> 00:08:54.825
Ming Yi, I told you,

00:08:55.465 --> 00:08:57.025
I won't let you die.

00:09:02.425 --> 00:09:03.265
Ming Yi.

00:09:09.705 --> 00:09:10.745
You…

00:09:12.625 --> 00:09:14.225
Immortal Situ!

00:09:15.905 --> 00:09:16.825
You…

00:09:58.825 --> 00:09:59.865
You're awake.

00:10:00.385 --> 00:10:01.465
How do you feel?

00:10:02.545 --> 00:10:03.505
Have some water.

00:10:11.905 --> 00:10:12.745
Here.

00:10:25.665 --> 00:10:28.145
Ming Yi, you know

00:10:29.265 --> 00:10:30.505
I did this willingly.

00:10:32.025 --> 00:10:33.225
Immortal Situ,

00:10:34.265 --> 00:10:35.985
when I took you to
the Qingyun Tournament years ago,

00:10:36.065 --> 00:10:37.025
it was just a small favor.

00:10:38.225 --> 00:10:40.585
Why are you so fixated on it

00:10:41.305 --> 00:10:42.825
that you went this far for me?

00:10:46.065 --> 00:10:46.905
Ming Yi,

00:10:48.105 --> 00:10:49.625
this is the first time

00:10:50.185 --> 00:10:51.865
you've acknowledged
who you truly are to me.

00:10:54.705 --> 00:10:56.225
I always knew,

00:10:58.105 --> 00:10:59.705
but hearing you admit it yourself

00:11:00.825 --> 00:11:01.985
means so much more.

00:11:04.545 --> 00:11:05.665
I'm sorry.

00:11:05.745 --> 00:11:08.865
You see me as your sister,
yet I kept secrets from you.

00:11:10.345 --> 00:11:12.225
You've held no grudge

00:11:12.305 --> 00:11:14.025
and helped me again and again.

00:11:14.105 --> 00:11:15.345
I truly don't know how to repay you.

00:11:20.905 --> 00:11:21.825
In fact, I was already

00:11:24.425 --> 00:11:26.425
in deep despair back then.

00:11:28.425 --> 00:11:31.105
If you hadn't taken me
to that Qingyun Tournament,

00:11:32.625 --> 00:11:34.825
stood on the Totem Platform with my badge,

00:11:34.905 --> 00:11:36.945
and said those words to me,

00:11:38.785 --> 00:11:40.225
I don't think I could've kept going.

00:11:43.825 --> 00:11:44.665
So,

00:11:46.465 --> 00:11:48.265
no matter how much lifespan it costs,

00:11:49.945 --> 00:11:51.665
I'm willing to give it.

00:11:52.905 --> 00:11:54.065
Ming Yi,

00:11:54.585 --> 00:11:55.825
without you,

00:11:56.665 --> 00:11:58.745
I would've given up on my life long ago.

00:11:59.985 --> 00:12:01.025
So,

00:12:03.225 --> 00:12:05.185
think of this as me fulfilling my wish.

00:12:09.065 --> 00:12:10.225
This time,

00:12:12.145 --> 00:12:13.985
let me be the one to keep you alive.

00:12:19.705 --> 00:12:21.705
You can't make
someone else your purpose in life.

00:12:21.785 --> 00:12:23.185
You should live for yourself.

00:12:25.985 --> 00:12:27.105
Immortal Situ,

00:12:27.185 --> 00:12:29.025
in truth, I'm the one who owes you.

00:12:29.105 --> 00:12:30.585
In that case,

00:12:31.225 --> 00:12:32.665
promise me one thing.

00:12:36.505 --> 00:12:37.905
I haven't decided what it will be yet,

00:12:39.625 --> 00:12:41.265
but you'll do

00:12:43.145 --> 00:12:44.505
whatever I ask for me,

00:12:46.065 --> 00:12:46.985
won't you?

00:13:34.025 --> 00:13:34.865
Your Lordship!

00:13:37.065 --> 00:13:37.985
Your Lordship.

00:13:47.425 --> 00:13:48.265
Your Lordship,

00:13:48.945 --> 00:13:50.945
you're suffering
the aftereffects of reversing the spell.

00:13:51.025 --> 00:13:53.865
If you give in,
you'll lose your mind completely.

00:13:53.945 --> 00:13:54.785
Hang in there.

00:13:59.505 --> 00:14:00.985
Fox blood can ease the pain for now.

00:14:02.025 --> 00:14:02.905
Your Lordship.

00:14:20.305 --> 00:14:21.225
Your Lordship.

00:14:37.025 --> 00:14:38.225
It doesn't hurt.

00:14:44.665 --> 00:14:46.545
Old Man She! Old Man She!

00:14:46.625 --> 00:14:47.545
Look! They're back!

00:14:47.625 --> 00:14:50.345
Just now, they suddenly recovered!

00:14:50.425 --> 00:14:52.545
-What did you say?
-My spiritual veins! Look!

00:15:07.505 --> 00:15:08.345
All right.

00:15:08.425 --> 00:15:11.425
-Stop using your spiritual power.
-No, look. They're really back. Look.

00:15:16.185 --> 00:15:18.385
And the Grief Blossom
isn't showing itself.

00:15:22.945 --> 00:15:24.945
You're better.

00:15:25.865 --> 00:15:26.705
You've really recovered.

00:15:27.585 --> 00:15:29.825
I knew you wouldn't die!

00:15:29.905 --> 00:15:32.345
I was so worried!

00:15:35.185 --> 00:15:37.145
All right.

00:15:37.225 --> 00:15:39.545
This is good news. Why are you crying?

00:15:46.225 --> 00:15:47.465
Did it just ring?

00:15:47.545 --> 00:15:48.785
Your spiritual veins have recovered.

00:15:48.865 --> 00:15:51.145
Of course Twenty-Seven would sense it.

00:15:51.225 --> 00:15:52.945
Your companion beast will return soon.

00:15:54.105 --> 00:15:56.625
A companion beast
comes into being when a cultivator

00:15:56.705 --> 00:15:57.905
reaches the Transcendent Stage.

00:15:57.985 --> 00:15:59.305
With your spiritual veins restored,

00:16:00.025 --> 00:16:01.785
Twenty-Seven's
lingering divine consciousness

00:16:01.865 --> 00:16:02.745
will also grow stronger gradually.

00:16:02.825 --> 00:16:04.785
Soon, you'll be able to bring him back.

00:16:08.505 --> 00:16:09.385
Twenty-Seven.

00:16:12.625 --> 00:16:15.745
You said Immortal Situ
refined his heart's blood

00:16:15.825 --> 00:16:17.905
and traded his lifespan for yours?

00:16:19.745 --> 00:16:22.305
He said it was
a secret technique of his clan.

00:16:22.385 --> 00:16:24.145
I never knew

00:16:24.225 --> 00:16:26.825
that Zhushui Spiritual State
had such a powerful clan

00:16:26.905 --> 00:16:28.545
with mastery of such a rare art.

00:16:28.625 --> 00:16:31.185
He sacrificed so much to save me.

00:16:31.785 --> 00:16:34.025
Even if he's keeping secrets from me,
I have no right to question him.

00:16:34.865 --> 00:16:38.145
To be honest, Immortal Situ
has really treated you well.

00:16:41.465 --> 00:16:44.865
I owe him so much I don't even know
how I could ever repay him.

00:16:46.385 --> 00:16:47.825
Stop thinking about it.
I'll make us something to eat.

00:16:47.905 --> 00:16:49.465
Let's celebrate properly tonight.

00:16:50.465 --> 00:16:51.305
I'm off.

00:16:52.105 --> 00:16:53.705
-Don't make too much.
-Don't worry.

00:16:55.265 --> 00:16:56.145
Ming Yi.

00:16:59.385 --> 00:17:00.585
From the sound of it,

00:17:01.105 --> 00:17:02.265
he only managed to keep you alive for now.

00:17:02.345 --> 00:17:04.385
What about the Heavenly Grief inside you?

00:17:05.025 --> 00:17:05.865
How do we get rid of it completely?

00:17:12.464 --> 00:17:13.865
Still,

00:17:14.464 --> 00:17:16.865
we should thank Situ Ling properly.

00:17:17.385 --> 00:17:20.385
Yes. I owe him too much.

00:17:21.985 --> 00:17:23.505
What do you plan to do next?

00:17:25.305 --> 00:17:27.424
Master,
let's return to Yaoguang Mountain at once.

00:17:28.184 --> 00:17:29.105
No way.

00:17:29.945 --> 00:17:31.945
What are you thinking?
What's in that head…?

00:17:38.505 --> 00:17:39.425
Ming Yi,

00:17:41.025 --> 00:17:43.825
right now, Madam Meng and
Ming Xin control Yaoguang Mountain.

00:17:44.345 --> 00:17:46.985
If you rush back there,
you'll fall straight into their trap.

00:17:48.105 --> 00:17:50.865
We must first find proof
that Ming Xin used poison

00:17:50.945 --> 00:17:52.785
and reveal what truly happened.

00:17:52.865 --> 00:17:55.545
Only then can you reclaim
the title of Crown Prince with honor.

00:17:56.465 --> 00:17:58.785
Though Father has
named Ming Xin Crown Prince,

00:17:58.865 --> 00:18:00.505
the investiture
ceremony hasn't taken place.

00:18:01.025 --> 00:18:03.265
He still doubts
whether Ming Xin is truly worthy

00:18:03.345 --> 00:18:04.745
of the position.

00:18:06.425 --> 00:18:07.625
If Ming Xin fails

00:18:07.705 --> 00:18:10.945
to represent Yaoguang Mountain as
Crown Prince in the two-realm tournament,

00:18:12.745 --> 00:18:14.585
he'll lose all face.

00:18:15.105 --> 00:18:15.945
The tea gathering.

00:18:17.265 --> 00:18:18.425
Before the two-realm tournament,

00:18:18.505 --> 00:18:20.425
Father plans to test
Ming Xin through the tea gathering.

00:18:35.505 --> 00:18:36.425
Here, Your Lordship.

00:18:58.545 --> 00:19:01.105
"My spiritual veins have
recovered, and I am well again.

00:19:01.185 --> 00:19:02.425
I offer you my deepest thanks.

00:19:02.505 --> 00:19:05.065
I will never forget
the promise I made to you.

00:19:05.145 --> 00:19:06.505
If you are ever in need,

00:19:06.585 --> 00:19:08.465
I will come to
your aid without hesitation,

00:19:08.545 --> 00:19:10.825
no matter what it takes.

00:19:10.905 --> 00:19:11.825
Ming Yi."

00:19:11.905 --> 00:19:14.145
Your Lordship has
sacrificed so much for her,

00:19:14.865 --> 00:19:16.705
yet she treats
it merely as a debt of gratitude.

00:19:17.825 --> 00:19:20.545
Will she treat Ji Bozai the same way?

00:19:20.625 --> 00:19:21.665
Enough.

00:19:22.985 --> 00:19:24.825
As long as she's
safe, that's all I care about.

00:19:26.825 --> 00:19:27.785
Really?

00:19:28.545 --> 00:19:30.185
Search your heart, Your Lordship.

00:19:30.985 --> 00:19:34.265
Do you really only want her to be safe?

00:19:35.185 --> 00:19:38.305
Can someone from Zhushui Spiritual State
really be such a fool for love

00:19:38.985 --> 00:19:41.225
-who expects nothing in return?
-Fuyue,

00:19:43.265 --> 00:19:45.425
I will never become
like my father or my brothers.

00:19:48.025 --> 00:19:49.025
Never.

00:19:51.025 --> 00:19:52.345
Are you saying that to me

00:19:53.745 --> 00:19:55.225
or to yourself?

00:20:02.705 --> 00:20:03.585
Your Lordship.

00:20:04.745 --> 00:20:05.985
Your Lordship.

00:20:06.065 --> 00:20:07.825
You won't become like them, Your Lordship.

00:20:09.185 --> 00:20:10.305
I know you won't.

00:20:24.265 --> 00:20:27.865
How did Ming Yi's
spiritual veins get restored?

00:20:29.665 --> 00:20:30.905
Didn't you say

00:20:32.785 --> 00:20:36.105
this technique
could only prolong her life?

00:20:36.625 --> 00:20:39.225
Her spiritual veins were
destroyed by the Heavenly Grief.

00:20:39.305 --> 00:20:41.025
Only the Golden Millet Dream
can heal them.

00:20:41.745 --> 00:20:42.585
I…

00:20:50.065 --> 00:20:50.945
You may go back.

00:20:51.025 --> 00:20:53.425
After some rest,
I'll return to the Judgment Hall.

00:20:54.305 --> 00:20:55.625
-Your Lordship…
-Don't worry.

00:20:57.585 --> 00:20:58.505
I'm fine.

00:21:28.385 --> 00:21:31.505
Chao Yuan, was it really worth it?

00:21:32.025 --> 00:21:34.225
Open your eyes and see.

00:21:34.305 --> 00:21:36.745
You gave her everything.

00:21:36.825 --> 00:21:38.745
You almost died.

00:21:38.825 --> 00:21:42.225
But has she ever cared for you?

00:21:42.305 --> 00:21:44.945
Has she ever truly seen you?

00:21:45.025 --> 00:21:49.265
Have you forgotten how you came this far?

00:21:49.345 --> 00:21:52.945
Did anyone ever show
you the slightest respect in the past?

00:21:53.545 --> 00:21:58.505
Have you forgotten it all?

00:22:00.625 --> 00:22:03.705
-Get in there!
-Get in there!

00:22:08.065 --> 00:22:10.865
Let me out!

00:22:13.745 --> 00:22:14.625
Here they come.

00:22:21.825 --> 00:22:23.785
-Come on out! Come out!
-How do you like that?

00:22:23.865 --> 00:22:25.465
-These are all prepared for you!
-Let me out!

00:22:25.545 --> 00:22:26.865
-Come out!
-Let me out!

00:22:26.945 --> 00:22:28.465
Come out if you can!

00:22:31.145 --> 00:22:32.705
-Get in yourself.
-Yes.

00:22:32.785 --> 00:22:34.425
Save us the trouble of beating you up.

00:22:34.505 --> 00:22:36.305
-Good boy.
-What a good boy.

00:22:38.745 --> 00:22:41.305
Why is he so quiet this time?

00:22:41.385 --> 00:22:43.105
-Now he's crying.
-That's more like it.

00:22:43.185 --> 00:22:44.945
As expected, one
without spiritual veins is worthless.

00:22:45.745 --> 00:22:47.345
You'll never crawl out of there yourself!

00:22:51.465 --> 00:22:54.785
After all these years,
he's still the same.

00:22:54.865 --> 00:22:55.705
This is no fun.

00:22:56.585 --> 00:22:58.105
That's enough for today.

00:23:18.905 --> 00:23:22.145
What are you still struggling for?

00:23:22.225 --> 00:23:25.745
You've never truly forgotten that pain.

00:23:25.825 --> 00:23:29.465
The Situ Ling everyone else sees is a lie.

00:23:29.545 --> 00:23:31.105
All that talk about willingness

00:23:31.185 --> 00:23:34.145
and selflessness is a lie!

00:23:34.785 --> 00:23:37.025
You are Chao Yuan.

00:23:37.105 --> 00:23:39.905
You're just like your father and brothers.

00:23:39.985 --> 00:23:41.145
I'm not.

00:23:47.985 --> 00:23:49.465
I'm not!

00:23:53.865 --> 00:23:55.385
The tea gathering is near,

00:23:55.465 --> 00:23:56.905
yet His Majesty passed so suddenly.

00:23:56.985 --> 00:23:59.145
The future of Jixing Abyss is uncertain.

00:23:59.225 --> 00:24:00.145
Yes.

00:24:00.225 --> 00:24:03.145
Are we really going to
let the Princess inherit the throne?

00:24:03.225 --> 00:24:04.705
What a disgrace.

00:24:06.145 --> 00:24:07.025
Never in history

00:24:07.105 --> 00:24:10.625
has a princess become the ruler.

00:24:11.145 --> 00:24:13.185
How are we supposed to hold on

00:24:13.265 --> 00:24:15.425
to our position among
the Upper Realms this year?

00:24:16.305 --> 00:24:17.625
-Right.
-Exactly.

00:24:18.225 --> 00:24:20.705
Meng Yangqiu,
what is the punishment for speaking ill

00:24:21.425 --> 00:24:22.585
of Her Majesty in private?

00:24:23.705 --> 00:24:26.585
According to the laws of Jixing Abyss,
30 lashes

00:24:27.185 --> 00:24:28.465
as a warning.

00:24:30.305 --> 00:24:32.745
Thirty lashes? That's fair.

00:24:33.265 --> 00:24:34.425
It's enough to break some bones,

00:24:35.065 --> 00:24:37.265
but not enough to cripple someone.

00:24:37.345 --> 00:24:38.745
Some people,

00:24:38.825 --> 00:24:41.025
born so lowly,

00:24:41.105 --> 00:24:42.865
only managed to crawl their way up
by clinging to others.

00:24:42.945 --> 00:24:43.745
You…

00:24:43.825 --> 00:24:47.105
Under a female monarch, I'm afraid
our realm will lose all decorum.

00:24:49.425 --> 00:24:50.465
Do we really need to wait

00:24:51.945 --> 00:24:53.905
for the law to punish
those who speak ill of our ruler?

00:24:55.065 --> 00:24:56.465
I spent most of my life imprisoned.

00:24:57.265 --> 00:24:59.105
I barely know anything about the law.

00:25:00.385 --> 00:25:02.545
If anyone keeps speaking filth before me,

00:25:03.705 --> 00:25:05.865
I'll kill them on the spot.

00:25:10.345 --> 00:25:12.185
Her Majesty is here!

00:26:00.665 --> 00:26:02.985
Whether you accept it or not,

00:26:04.745 --> 00:26:07.265
I am now the new ruler of Jixing Abyss.

00:26:08.065 --> 00:26:09.265
She…

00:26:10.025 --> 00:26:12.625
You all have ears and eyes.

00:26:14.145 --> 00:26:16.065
You can hear and you can see.

00:26:16.945 --> 00:26:18.745
Judge for yourselves

00:26:18.825 --> 00:26:20.465
how I rule from this day on

00:26:21.025 --> 00:26:22.945
and whether I am worthy of this seat.

00:26:24.385 --> 00:26:26.385
Today, I give you my word:

00:26:27.065 --> 00:26:28.985
I will lead Jixing Abyss

00:26:29.065 --> 00:26:31.545
to win the Blessed Rain
at the Qingyun Tournament.

00:26:33.105 --> 00:26:34.385
If I fail,

00:26:35.905 --> 00:26:38.505
I will step down of my own accord.

00:26:43.665 --> 00:26:45.105
We'll see if she keeps her word.

00:26:45.185 --> 00:26:46.705
-Can she do it?
-Fair enough.

00:26:57.905 --> 00:27:00.545
I think you were right.

00:27:01.665 --> 00:27:02.505
About what?

00:27:04.185 --> 00:27:05.945
When the water is too
clear, no fish can survive.

00:27:06.505 --> 00:27:08.345
If one seeks an uncorrupted rule,

00:27:09.865 --> 00:27:11.545
perhaps the first step

00:27:11.625 --> 00:27:13.065
is to cast away purity itself.

00:27:15.025 --> 00:27:18.345
Life and death are forever intertwined.

00:27:20.705 --> 00:27:22.185
Only by emerging from filth and decay

00:27:23.705 --> 00:27:24.945
can one reach true
benevolence and the Way.

00:27:31.945 --> 00:27:32.985
In all honesty,

00:27:33.985 --> 00:27:35.305
if possible,

00:27:36.345 --> 00:27:39.225
I'd still rather see you
stand in the light.

00:27:41.705 --> 00:27:42.545
That's my selfish wish.

00:27:51.425 --> 00:27:52.265
Tianji,

00:27:53.825 --> 00:27:54.905
you can leave

00:27:56.305 --> 00:27:57.705
all the dirty work to me.

00:27:58.945 --> 00:28:00.385
I'm willing to be your blade.

00:28:05.105 --> 00:28:07.105
I don't need someone
to soil their hands for me.

00:28:08.065 --> 00:28:09.865
I will never be that kind of ruler.

00:28:11.585 --> 00:28:13.385
I will bear both the good and the bad

00:28:14.345 --> 00:28:15.465
of Jixing Abyss

00:28:17.625 --> 00:28:19.265
myself.

00:28:25.825 --> 00:28:27.825
But I do have one question.

00:28:29.505 --> 00:28:30.465
Immortal Yan,

00:28:31.305 --> 00:28:33.305
would you walk this path with me?

00:28:50.225 --> 00:28:51.305
With unwavering devotion.

00:29:01.585 --> 00:29:02.625
Good.

00:29:18.865 --> 00:29:21.145
May stars and
blessings forever grace the Abyss.

00:29:21.225 --> 00:29:23.825
Greetings, Your Majesty.

00:29:23.905 --> 00:29:24.985
It seems

00:29:25.065 --> 00:29:26.865
that among everyone
today, only you and Xiuyun

00:29:26.945 --> 00:29:28.385
saluted me with sincerity.

00:29:32.105 --> 00:29:32.985
Ming Yi,

00:29:33.585 --> 00:29:35.905
do you believe I can be a good ruler?

00:29:39.065 --> 00:29:42.185
Whether others believe in you or not
means nothing.

00:29:42.265 --> 00:29:44.785
Follow your words with
actions and see them through.

00:29:44.865 --> 00:29:46.465
Sooner or later, all will

00:29:46.545 --> 00:29:48.105
bow before you.

00:29:48.185 --> 00:29:49.465
You're right.

00:29:49.545 --> 00:29:51.505
If they refuse to submit,

00:29:51.585 --> 00:29:53.705
they can try to take
this seat for themselves.

00:29:54.385 --> 00:29:55.745
Let's see

00:29:56.465 --> 00:29:58.145
if they're capable of that.

00:29:58.225 --> 00:30:00.225
With such resolve,

00:30:00.305 --> 00:30:02.265
Your Majesty will
surely achieve greatness.

00:30:02.345 --> 00:30:03.985
I look forward to witnessing it.

00:30:05.705 --> 00:30:07.105
Come, sit with me.

00:30:16.305 --> 00:30:18.745
Ming Yi, have you heard?

00:30:18.825 --> 00:30:20.385
I made a promise

00:30:20.465 --> 00:30:23.625
to lead Jixing Abyss
to victory in the Qingyun Tournament.

00:30:24.505 --> 00:30:25.665
If I fail, I'll abdicate the throne.

00:30:27.185 --> 00:30:28.145
So,

00:30:29.385 --> 00:30:30.385
I want your help.

00:30:36.345 --> 00:30:38.105
Ji Bozai can't forge artifacts,

00:30:38.185 --> 00:30:40.825
yet in the battle against
the netherbeast army on the Prayer Night,

00:30:40.905 --> 00:30:42.105
he wielded a demon-repelling parasol.

00:30:42.785 --> 00:30:45.625
That must have been your work, right?

00:30:49.025 --> 00:30:52.145
So, Ming Yi,

00:30:53.185 --> 00:30:54.345
join Shouhua Academy.

00:30:59.345 --> 00:31:00.705
If I refuse,

00:31:01.225 --> 00:31:04.265
what will you do, Your Majesty?

00:31:08.985 --> 00:31:12.185
At first, I thought about
threatening you with your life.

00:31:12.985 --> 00:31:14.825
Later, I considered other ways.

00:31:15.345 --> 00:31:16.985
But in the end, I came to a realization:

00:31:18.345 --> 00:31:21.305
you made the demon-repelling parasol
to protect the innocent.

00:31:22.025 --> 00:31:23.465
I shouldn't pressure someone like you.

00:31:28.985 --> 00:31:31.665
So please, Ming Yi, I'm begging you.

00:31:32.265 --> 00:31:35.065
I know you've been
staying at Zhang Tai's place lately.

00:31:35.145 --> 00:31:37.785
Something must've
happened between you and Ji Bozai.

00:31:37.865 --> 00:31:41.585
I get it. Married couples
shouldn't be apart for too long.

00:31:41.665 --> 00:31:43.585
But there are only
four people at the Academy.

00:31:43.665 --> 00:31:45.785
I really need you.

00:31:45.865 --> 00:31:47.705
Chen Xi is still young.

00:31:47.785 --> 00:31:51.065
However talented he is,
he needs proper guidance, doesn't he?

00:31:51.145 --> 00:31:53.625
We lost seven years in
a row. Our best talents all left.

00:31:53.705 --> 00:31:55.585
We are falling far behind
the other realms in forging.

00:31:55.665 --> 00:31:58.625
Yet people still call Jixing Abyss
a land of master Forgers.

00:31:58.705 --> 00:32:00.305
It's embarrassing just to hear it.

00:32:00.385 --> 00:32:03.705
Ming Yi, if you don't help me,
we're doomed!

00:32:03.785 --> 00:32:05.345
Please.

00:32:06.305 --> 00:32:08.745
You're the Empress now.

00:32:08.825 --> 00:32:10.265
-Can you act like one?
-No.

00:32:10.345 --> 00:32:11.665
My dignity doesn't matter.

00:32:11.745 --> 00:32:14.945
As Empress, my top priority is to find
a great Forger for Shouhua Academy.

00:32:15.745 --> 00:32:17.785
Politics, pride…

00:32:18.425 --> 00:32:20.385
None of that works on you anyway.

00:32:24.545 --> 00:32:26.545
-Let go.
-No.

00:32:27.425 --> 00:32:29.785
-Let go!
-Not until you say yes!

00:32:30.945 --> 00:32:32.105
What brings you here, Yan?

00:32:34.065 --> 00:32:36.265
This year's tea gathering will
be held at Yaoguang Mountain,

00:32:36.345 --> 00:32:37.705
which puts
Jixing Abyss at a great disadvantage.

00:32:38.705 --> 00:32:41.505
So I came to ask if you'd be willing
to move into Shouhua Academy for now.

00:32:42.105 --> 00:32:44.385
It'll give us more time to train together,

00:32:45.105 --> 00:32:45.945
and it'll boost morale.

00:32:48.225 --> 00:32:49.065
Of course.

00:32:49.585 --> 00:32:52.505
As a warrior of Jixing Abyss,
that's my duty.

00:32:53.625 --> 00:32:55.225
I appreciate it, Ji. Farewell.

00:33:05.265 --> 00:33:06.105
Your Lordship,

00:33:06.185 --> 00:33:08.385
you asked me to look into the message
that lured you to Zhangwei Mountain.

00:33:08.465 --> 00:33:09.585
I couldn't find the sender.

00:33:16.865 --> 00:33:18.625
MING YI HAS GONE TO THE ZHANGWEI MOUNTAIN

00:33:18.705 --> 00:33:21.225
TO OBTAIN THE SECOND
HALF OF "BO'S MEDICAL CLASSICS"

00:33:21.985 --> 00:33:23.145
Your Lordship,

00:33:23.225 --> 00:33:24.905
the sender didn't leave their name,

00:33:24.985 --> 00:33:26.905
and the handwriting has been altered.

00:33:30.585 --> 00:33:32.545
The sender deliberately
lured me there to rescue Ming Yi

00:33:33.345 --> 00:33:35.305
but set no traps.

00:33:36.945 --> 00:33:38.905
Only Situ Ling would
do something like that.

00:33:40.545 --> 00:33:43.185
Did you find anything about him,
as I asked?

00:33:43.265 --> 00:33:45.905
I located the head of the Situ clan.

00:33:49.065 --> 00:33:51.785
After Mu Qibai's death,
he feared he might be implicated,

00:33:51.865 --> 00:33:52.905
so he went into hiding.

00:33:52.985 --> 00:33:54.145
I found him

00:33:54.225 --> 00:33:56.105
and told him he'd be spared
if he told the truth,

00:33:56.745 --> 00:33:57.865
so he confessed everything.

00:33:58.865 --> 00:34:01.065
In fact, he forged Situ Ling's identity.

00:34:01.145 --> 00:34:04.225
The Situ clan
never had a long-lost younger son.

00:34:04.745 --> 00:34:06.105
Situ Ling's true identity

00:34:06.185 --> 00:34:09.185
is Chao Yuan, the son
of the Emperor of Zhushui.

00:34:15.744 --> 00:34:17.905
He's the son of the Emperor of Zhushui?

00:34:20.225 --> 00:34:21.905
Then why did he infiltrate Jixing Abyss

00:34:22.505 --> 00:34:23.784
in the first place?

00:34:26.505 --> 00:34:28.625
Judging by his actions,

00:34:29.145 --> 00:34:31.145
it doesn't seem like
he was on Mu Qibai's side.

00:34:31.744 --> 00:34:34.545
I went to Zhushui Spiritual State
and learned

00:34:34.625 --> 00:34:37.105
that Chao Yuan had no spiritual veins
and was never favored by his father.

00:34:37.945 --> 00:34:40.344
He'd long been
bullied by his elder brothers.

00:34:41.145 --> 00:34:42.505
He most likely escaped on his own.

00:34:43.865 --> 00:34:46.344
-When did he come to Jixing Abyss?
-It's been some time.

00:34:47.105 --> 00:34:47.945
The head of the Situ clan

00:34:48.025 --> 00:34:50.065
said that at first,
he stayed with their clan,

00:34:50.145 --> 00:34:51.585
claiming he was there on a mission.

00:34:52.344 --> 00:34:54.105
He also inquired about the Sunken Abyss.

00:34:55.505 --> 00:34:58.625
After last year's Qingyun Tournament,
he assumed the identity of Situ Ling,

00:34:58.705 --> 00:35:01.425
took Jixing Abyss's Immortal Examination,
and joined the Judgment Hall.

00:35:05.425 --> 00:35:07.145
He must have learned in Zhushui Palace

00:35:07.905 --> 00:35:10.625
that Mu Qibai was using the Sunken Abyss
to refine medicine.

00:35:14.225 --> 00:35:16.745
I went to the divine capital

00:35:16.825 --> 00:35:18.985
after last year's Qingyun Tournament.

00:35:22.225 --> 00:35:23.305
He must've come

00:35:23.945 --> 00:35:26.105
for the Golden Millet Dream.

00:35:27.665 --> 00:35:29.225
You did it again!

00:35:30.505 --> 00:35:33.785
Calm down. Look, you even
made dust fall into my bowl.

00:35:35.945 --> 00:35:37.985
I'm not taking an official
post at Shouhua Academy.

00:35:38.065 --> 00:35:40.145
I'm just teaching forging.

00:35:40.225 --> 00:35:41.825
That way, I can go to
the tea gathering with them

00:35:41.905 --> 00:35:43.625
without raising suspicion.

00:35:43.705 --> 00:35:45.865
I will only agree to
your request verbally.

00:35:47.185 --> 00:35:49.585
You grant me the Blessed Rain,
and I'll teach Chen Xi how to forge.

00:35:50.705 --> 00:35:51.865
But I have two more conditions.

00:35:52.785 --> 00:35:53.905
Sure.

00:35:55.265 --> 00:35:58.785
Shouldn't you hear them first
before deciding whether to agree?

00:35:58.865 --> 00:36:00.505
I've seen the demon-repelling parasol.

00:36:00.585 --> 00:36:03.905
No one in Jixing Abyss
can match your forging skills.

00:36:04.985 --> 00:36:06.825
If you agree to teach at the Academy,

00:36:06.905 --> 00:36:09.145
I'll meet any condition you name.

00:36:14.105 --> 00:36:15.025
First,

00:36:15.105 --> 00:36:18.265
I want to accompany the warriors
to the tea gathering.

00:36:18.345 --> 00:36:19.545
No problem.

00:36:19.625 --> 00:36:21.905
Second, I want Your Majesty to promise

00:36:21.985 --> 00:36:24.425
to give it your all while
preparing for the Qingyun Tournament.

00:36:24.505 --> 00:36:25.865
When the Six Realms gather,

00:36:25.945 --> 00:36:26.785
you must expose the crimes

00:36:26.865 --> 00:36:29.865
of the Emperor of Zhushui
and his followers before everyone.

00:36:32.025 --> 00:36:33.265
Agreed.

00:36:33.345 --> 00:36:35.305
That's what I've always intended to do.

00:36:38.785 --> 00:36:39.785
Now,

00:36:40.545 --> 00:36:43.585
welcome to Shouhua Academy, Fairy Ming Yi.

00:36:48.385 --> 00:36:49.345
So that's your plan.

00:36:50.545 --> 00:36:53.865
If you can't outsmart Ming Xin,
at least you'll have helped form a force

00:36:53.945 --> 00:36:55.345
to stand against Zhushui Spiritual State.

00:37:02.025 --> 00:37:05.905
Since I've already
stepped down as the Venerable,

00:37:05.985 --> 00:37:08.065
I'll use this time

00:37:08.585 --> 00:37:10.785
to search for the ingredients
needed to make the Golden Millet Dream.

00:37:11.345 --> 00:37:14.145
Honestly,
I still can't tell if the poison in you

00:37:14.225 --> 00:37:15.425
is truly gone.

00:37:17.065 --> 00:37:18.385
While I'm out looking
for the herbs, remember to…

00:37:18.465 --> 00:37:19.665
I can take care of myself.

00:37:22.425 --> 00:37:24.385
Be good, or else…

00:37:25.265 --> 00:37:27.345
What are you? A three-year-old?

00:37:28.425 --> 00:37:29.305
Oh, right.

00:37:29.985 --> 00:37:32.705
Every year, there's a spiritual power
contest at the tea gathering,

00:37:34.105 --> 00:37:36.345
followed by a travelers' competition.

00:37:36.425 --> 00:37:38.425
Anyone besides the warriors can join.

00:37:38.505 --> 00:37:40.705
It's meant to let
ordinary people of the Six Realms

00:37:40.785 --> 00:37:42.025
test their skills against each other.

00:37:42.545 --> 00:37:45.025
I've heard this year's prize

00:37:45.105 --> 00:37:46.345
is a black lingzhi mushroom.

00:37:46.425 --> 00:37:48.705
It can help companion
beasts regain their form.

00:37:51.345 --> 00:37:52.665
So it can bring Twenty-Seven back?

00:37:54.425 --> 00:37:55.825
-Smart girl.
-Really?

00:37:56.705 --> 00:37:59.465
With that mushroom,
you can speed up Twenty-Seven's revival.

00:37:59.545 --> 00:38:01.905
Twenty-Seven, did you hear that?

00:38:06.145 --> 00:38:07.985
There's a way to bring you back.

00:38:10.305 --> 00:38:11.625
Just wait for me, all right?

00:38:15.305 --> 00:38:17.345
The Tiger-Subduing Shield.
Strong in both offense and defense,

00:38:17.425 --> 00:38:18.505
especially the latter.

00:38:18.585 --> 00:38:19.425
It suits you, Meng Yangqiu.

00:38:19.505 --> 00:38:20.705
Thank you, Fairy Ming Yi.

00:38:21.745 --> 00:38:23.545
This is the Lvqi Zither.

00:38:23.625 --> 00:38:25.785
It has a quick attack speed
and can amplify healing effects.

00:38:25.865 --> 00:38:27.465
Yan Xiao, this one's for you.

00:38:28.905 --> 00:38:30.065
Thank you, Fairy Ming Yi.

00:38:30.745 --> 00:38:32.345
This is the Haotian Staff.

00:38:33.385 --> 00:38:35.905
Once you channel spiritual power into it,
you can strike enemies

00:38:35.985 --> 00:38:38.665
from 100 chi away
and knock down everyone in its path.

00:38:39.425 --> 00:38:41.185
-Thank you, Master!
-Did I say you could have it?

00:38:42.985 --> 00:38:44.305
Just kidding. It's yours.

00:38:44.905 --> 00:38:45.745
Here, take it.

00:38:48.265 --> 00:38:49.865
Ji, come and try these artifacts.

00:38:50.425 --> 00:38:52.545
With your strength
and Ming Yi's craftsmanship,

00:38:52.625 --> 00:38:54.465
no one in the Six Realms
would be able to rival you.

00:38:54.545 --> 00:38:55.425
What are you doing here?

00:38:55.505 --> 00:38:58.305
By order of Her Majesty,
I've joined Shouhua Academy

00:38:58.385 --> 00:39:00.025
to teach Chen Xi forging.

00:39:04.345 --> 00:39:07.265
You didn't know Fairy Ming Yi

00:39:07.345 --> 00:39:10.145
had joined Shouhua Academy?

00:39:14.185 --> 00:39:16.145
-Actually, Immortal Ji and I…
-Come with me.

00:39:17.065 --> 00:39:19.185
Wait, I wasn't finished.

00:39:19.265 --> 00:39:21.305
Did Immortal Ji and Fairy Ming Yi

00:39:21.385 --> 00:39:22.825
have a fight?

00:39:27.145 --> 00:39:30.225
Come back… Children shouldn't
meddle in adult matters.

00:39:33.025 --> 00:39:34.585
Just stop here. There's no one around.

00:39:36.545 --> 00:39:37.465
Why are you really here?

00:39:39.585 --> 00:39:41.225
I want to go to the tea gathering

00:39:41.305 --> 00:39:43.425
to find proof that Ming Xin poisoned me.

00:39:43.505 --> 00:39:45.145
If I wait until my father
holds the investiture ceremony

00:39:45.225 --> 00:39:46.985
to name him Crown Prince,

00:39:47.065 --> 00:39:49.465
-it'll be too late.
-Staying at Shouhua Academy

00:39:49.545 --> 00:39:50.505
could easily expose your true identity.

00:39:51.185 --> 00:39:52.625
I don't even know much about forging,

00:39:52.705 --> 00:39:54.985
yet I saw the similarities
between the Nirvana and the Embers.

00:39:55.825 --> 00:39:57.585
Do you think I'm an idiot?
That I'd forge weapons

00:39:57.665 --> 00:39:59.585
for everyone
that look just like the Embers?

00:40:06.465 --> 00:40:09.465
You've only seen
a fraction of my forging skill.

00:40:09.545 --> 00:40:12.065
The artifacts I create
are far beyond your imagination.

00:40:12.985 --> 00:40:15.345
So don't worry.
No one will find out who I really am.

00:40:15.425 --> 00:40:16.585
Fine.

00:40:17.145 --> 00:40:18.705
Since you dared to
come to Shouhua Academy,

00:40:19.345 --> 00:40:20.505
does it mean
your spiritual veins have healed?

00:40:30.545 --> 00:40:32.825
Thank you for your concern, Immortal Ji.

00:40:32.905 --> 00:40:35.345
Yes, they have,
perhaps through divine mercy.

00:40:35.425 --> 00:40:37.665
I also owe it to the elixir
Immortal Situ refined for me.

00:40:37.745 --> 00:40:39.585
Otherwise, I wouldn't have survived.

00:40:40.905 --> 00:40:42.985
Immortal Situ?

00:40:46.625 --> 00:40:47.825
Situ Ling?

00:40:47.905 --> 00:40:49.665
Yes. And my master

00:40:49.745 --> 00:40:51.625
also transferred half his power to me.

00:40:51.705 --> 00:40:54.025
But I'm not sure
whether the poison's been purged

00:40:54.105 --> 00:40:55.225
or if it's just a temporary recovery.

00:40:55.305 --> 00:40:56.945
Either way, I'm not in pain now,

00:40:57.025 --> 00:40:58.705
and I'm safe for now.

00:41:08.585 --> 00:41:09.585
How did he save you?

00:41:13.225 --> 00:41:14.345
With his heart's blood.

00:41:14.945 --> 00:41:16.865
He gave me some of his lifespan.

00:41:17.385 --> 00:41:19.785
I owe him a great debt.

00:41:25.145 --> 00:41:25.985
What's wrong?

00:41:29.145 --> 00:41:30.105
Congratulations.

00:41:31.025 --> 00:41:35.025
Wait! I owe you too, Immortal Ji.

00:41:40.065 --> 00:41:41.905
Even though
the Golden Millet Dream's recipe

00:41:41.985 --> 00:41:43.105
never came into use,

00:41:43.945 --> 00:41:45.625
without your help,

00:41:46.545 --> 00:41:48.785
I would've died searching for it.

00:41:53.905 --> 00:41:55.265
Thank you, Immortal Ji.

00:41:59.185 --> 00:42:00.265
I'll take my leave now.

00:42:16.945 --> 00:42:18.905
Did you really give
the Golden Millet Dream to Ming Yi?

00:42:20.265 --> 00:42:22.105
Are you slamming the table at me?

00:42:22.625 --> 00:42:25.745
Does that even matter?
You should be worrying about yourself now!

00:42:27.945 --> 00:42:30.265
Do you not value your own life at all?

00:42:30.345 --> 00:42:32.145
Have you forgotten
that the Heavenly Grief in you

00:42:32.225 --> 00:42:33.625
was never truly purged?

00:42:35.985 --> 00:42:37.785
Back then, because
there was no catalyst herb,

00:42:37.865 --> 00:42:39.945
Fairy Bo had to use
her clan's secret technique

00:42:40.025 --> 00:42:41.985
and combine other
ingredients of the Golden Millet Dream

00:42:42.065 --> 00:42:44.305
to suppress
the Heavenly Grief in your body.

00:42:44.825 --> 00:42:47.505
But it could relapse at any time.

00:42:48.385 --> 00:42:51.505
Later, Fairy Bo made
the complete Golden Millet Dream

00:42:51.585 --> 00:42:52.625
and left it to you.

00:42:52.705 --> 00:42:54.425
But now you've given it to Ming Yi.

00:42:54.505 --> 00:42:57.465
If you suffer a relapse someday,
what will you do then?

00:42:58.225 --> 00:43:00.585
Buxiu, I know what I'm doing.

00:43:00.665 --> 00:43:01.945
Do you?

00:43:02.025 --> 00:43:03.425
Then why did I sense

00:43:03.505 --> 00:43:05.665
the Spirit Well you formed
with your spiritual power has closed?

00:43:06.745 --> 00:43:09.545
Did you drain your own power to refine
the Golden Millet Dream directly?

00:43:10.425 --> 00:43:11.825
Planting the Golden Millet Dream
within someone

00:43:11.905 --> 00:43:13.665
takes an enormous
amount of spiritual power,

00:43:13.745 --> 00:43:15.905
and the process
feels like being flayed alive.

00:43:16.425 --> 00:43:19.545
You did all this so Ming Yi
could take it directly,

00:43:19.625 --> 00:43:20.665
didn't you?

00:43:21.265 --> 00:43:22.985
Did you really go that far?
