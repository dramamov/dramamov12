00:00:07.307 --> 00:00:12.078
If a reset button appeared before me

00:00:12.145 --> 00:00:13.880
would I press it?

00:00:17.784 --> 00:00:19.185
And if I did

00:00:20.020 --> 00:00:22.422
what point would I go back to?

00:00:26.326 --> 00:00:27.627
How many exes do you have?

00:00:31.698 --> 00:00:35.101
Maya and I met eight years ago.

00:00:35.168 --> 00:00:38.238
I was invited to a mixer
to even out the numbers.

00:00:45.045 --> 00:00:46.179
It's...

00:00:47.714 --> 00:00:49.149
my first time.

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:51.885
Going to a mixer.

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:55.588
Congratulations.

00:00:56.556 --> 00:00:58.591
For what?

00:00:59.325 --> 00:01:01.061
I think it's worth celebrating.

00:01:02.162 --> 00:01:03.396
Let's toast to it.

00:01:04.264 --> 00:01:05.398
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

00:01:06.499 --> 00:01:07.901
Thank you.

00:01:07.967 --> 00:01:09.402
It was my first time

00:01:10.003 --> 00:01:13.606
meeting a girl
who'd give me such a kind smile.

00:01:14.407 --> 00:01:15.508
I'm sorry.

00:01:17.277 --> 00:01:18.912
Drop dead.

00:01:20.513 --> 00:01:23.616
Whenever someone's cruel words
pained my heart

00:01:25.885 --> 00:01:28.588
seeing Maya would heal me.

00:01:32.358 --> 00:01:33.793
Drop dead.

00:01:34.794 --> 00:01:36.963
- What was that?
- Oh, man.

00:01:38.398 --> 00:01:39.999
So creepy.

00:01:40.066 --> 00:01:45.371
A brutal world where people casually
invalidated others' existences.

00:01:46.506 --> 00:01:47.674
But...

00:01:48.808 --> 00:01:50.310
when I'm with her...

00:01:54.581 --> 00:01:57.617
We made an oath to live
the rest of our lives together.

00:01:59.419 --> 00:02:00.787
And yet...

00:02:00.854 --> 00:02:02.021
If only...

00:02:04.924 --> 00:02:07.127
If only you'd just die!

00:03:42.956 --> 00:03:45.925
PLEASE DIE MY BELOVED

00:03:48.127 --> 00:03:49.128
Well then.

00:03:50.396 --> 00:03:51.497
What now?

00:03:57.103 --> 00:03:59.572
You'll do whatever I say, right?

00:04:03.109 --> 00:04:04.811
And if I refuse?

00:04:04.877 --> 00:04:06.145
I'll expose you.

00:04:07.447 --> 00:04:10.116
I'll share the video
and your identities.

00:04:12.885 --> 00:04:14.387
It'll be over

00:04:15.388 --> 00:04:18.491
for you and your two friends.

00:04:20.426 --> 00:04:22.128
Don't hurt them.

00:04:23.796 --> 00:04:25.465
I'll do what you say.

00:04:31.204 --> 00:04:33.006
Let's see...

00:04:33.072 --> 00:04:34.707
What should I make you do?

00:04:36.409 --> 00:04:38.978
Man, it's been so boring
around here lately.

00:04:41.147 --> 00:04:42.181
Isn't this exciting?

00:04:44.017 --> 00:04:45.018
Right?

00:04:47.420 --> 00:04:48.688
Answer me.

00:05:14.914 --> 00:05:16.182
Welcome home, Maya.

00:05:17.383 --> 00:05:19.018
You haven't eaten, right?

00:05:19.819 --> 00:05:23.556
I bought some random stuff
from the market...

00:05:29.329 --> 00:05:32.865
Sorry, did I say something wrong?

00:05:44.844 --> 00:05:45.845
Maya?

00:05:53.419 --> 00:05:54.454
I'm...

00:05:57.523 --> 00:05:59.092
on your side.

00:06:42.468 --> 00:06:44.470
All right. Ready? Push.

00:07:00.286 --> 00:07:01.354
Whoa.

00:07:01.921 --> 00:07:03.089
Oh, damn.

00:07:03.589 --> 00:07:05.158
I just got that on camera.

00:07:11.831 --> 00:07:12.899
Are you okay?

00:07:15.735 --> 00:07:18.404
Huh? Are you dead?

00:07:19.972 --> 00:07:21.007
Hey.

00:07:22.275 --> 00:07:24.343
Hey...

00:07:24.410 --> 00:07:25.411
Hey!

00:07:27.880 --> 00:07:29.048
Ambulance.

00:07:29.749 --> 00:07:31.884
Huh? What's that?

00:07:32.418 --> 00:07:34.020
You like ambulances?

00:07:34.086 --> 00:07:36.255
Call one already.

00:07:52.805 --> 00:07:53.806
My hands slipped.

00:08:01.214 --> 00:08:02.582
You know...

00:08:03.950 --> 00:08:05.318
You always...

00:08:07.053 --> 00:08:08.921
Always...

00:08:08.988 --> 00:08:10.456
Always!

00:08:11.023 --> 00:08:14.126
Acted so freaking arrogant!

00:08:20.867 --> 00:08:21.968
So damn annoying.

00:08:23.736 --> 00:08:24.837
I'm scared.

00:08:25.905 --> 00:08:29.342
But let's go check.

00:08:51.197 --> 00:08:52.932
We killed him.

00:08:54.033 --> 00:08:56.936
We really did it.

00:08:59.338 --> 00:09:00.473
Yeah.

00:09:20.593 --> 00:09:22.228
Sorry, it's just so funny.

00:09:31.003 --> 00:09:32.104
What the hell.

00:09:32.872 --> 00:09:33.906
Hello?

00:09:34.707 --> 00:09:36.709
What time are you coming home?

00:09:36.776 --> 00:09:39.312
What? I don't know.

00:09:43.249 --> 00:09:46.552
Yurika
I'm leaving the hospital today

00:09:58.164 --> 00:10:00.633
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

00:10:00.700 --> 00:10:01.834
Got some sleep?

00:10:02.735 --> 00:10:03.736
Yeah.

00:10:05.438 --> 00:10:07.139
Really? Good.

00:10:13.746 --> 00:10:15.281
Good morning, Maya.

00:10:15.348 --> 00:10:17.516
Kana, good morning.

00:10:18.017 --> 00:10:20.920
Um, I'm sorry for
dropping this out of nowhere

00:10:21.654 --> 00:10:24.557
but I'm quitting
at the end of the month.

00:10:25.057 --> 00:10:26.125
What?

00:10:27.193 --> 00:10:29.895
I was actually headhunted.

00:10:31.163 --> 00:10:33.566
Sorry I didn't tell you.

00:10:34.867 --> 00:10:35.868
It's fine.

00:10:36.569 --> 00:10:38.237
That's great. Congratulations.

00:10:38.304 --> 00:10:40.406
Thank you.

00:10:40.473 --> 00:10:41.807
We should celebrate.

00:10:42.642 --> 00:10:45.878
Then I want to have
a hot pot party at your house.

00:10:47.113 --> 00:10:48.748
Oh, like we did last year.

00:10:48.814 --> 00:10:52.818
Your place was so nice,
I'd love to visit again.

00:10:52.885 --> 00:10:54.520
Of course. Anytime.

00:10:54.587 --> 00:10:56.822
Hooray! I can't wait.

00:10:56.889 --> 00:10:59.325
- Kana, can you check this?
- Yeah.

00:11:08.267 --> 00:11:09.268
SENDA

00:11:09.335 --> 00:11:11.837
Come to Hotel Atlas
in Kabuki-cho at 5 p.m.

00:11:24.817 --> 00:11:26.886
This apartment's nice too.

00:11:28.654 --> 00:11:30.423
Really?

00:11:30.489 --> 00:11:32.525
If you don't press charges

00:11:32.591 --> 00:11:35.928
he'll accept the divorce
with whatever conditions you request.

00:11:37.763 --> 00:11:40.332
Even the settlement and custody?

00:11:40.399 --> 00:11:41.734
Yes.

00:11:41.801 --> 00:11:43.969
It seems he'll agree to anything.

00:12:58.711 --> 00:13:00.479
Good, stick your legs out.

00:13:00.546 --> 00:13:02.581
It's Noa!

00:13:02.648 --> 00:13:04.617
It's Yuna!

00:13:10.456 --> 00:13:13.292
Did you get hurt? Are you okay?

00:13:14.393 --> 00:13:16.829
I had a bit of a fall, but I'm fine.

00:13:19.398 --> 00:13:21.834
Any plans for the holidays?

00:13:24.937 --> 00:13:27.139
We're going to Hawaii.

00:13:27.973 --> 00:13:31.544
I know it's a bit clichÃ©,
but my husband likes it.

00:13:37.349 --> 00:13:40.052
I'm getting divorced.

00:13:42.721 --> 00:13:43.722
What?

00:13:48.060 --> 00:13:52.731
I always looked up to you, Emi.

00:13:53.999 --> 00:13:56.235
You have a wonderful husband

00:13:56.302 --> 00:13:58.170
and the perfect family.

00:13:59.772 --> 00:14:05.444
But I decided to start over
with me and my daughter.

00:14:11.417 --> 00:14:14.053
Thank you for being the person

00:14:15.120 --> 00:14:18.591
that I could always
look up to until now.

00:14:23.863 --> 00:14:25.397
Here.

00:14:31.136 --> 00:14:32.371
Please...

00:14:34.106 --> 00:14:35.541
divorce me.

00:14:39.845 --> 00:14:40.913
I want...

00:14:42.381 --> 00:14:44.116
you to let me go.

00:14:48.220 --> 00:14:49.955
I want to live a free life.

00:14:50.022 --> 00:14:51.290
With my child.

00:14:51.824 --> 00:14:52.925
The two of us.

00:14:56.929 --> 00:14:57.997
Please.

00:15:05.337 --> 00:15:07.373
Will that make you happy, Riko?

00:15:14.280 --> 00:15:15.281
Yeah.

00:15:16.582 --> 00:15:17.950
If I'm not around anymore

00:15:20.219 --> 00:15:21.987
will that make you happy?

00:17:11.163 --> 00:17:12.631
When can we meet next?

00:17:12.698 --> 00:17:15.300
Hmm, let me think.

00:17:15.367 --> 00:17:17.369
I want to meet up, but I'm so busy.

00:17:17.436 --> 00:17:18.470
How's next week?

00:17:18.537 --> 00:17:20.072
Next week?

00:17:20.806 --> 00:17:22.708
- Let's get food.
- You sure?

00:17:27.279 --> 00:17:30.616
SHINICHI SENDA

00:17:32.885 --> 00:17:34.019
Hello?

00:17:35.487 --> 00:17:36.722
Who...

00:17:37.523 --> 00:17:38.657
are you?

00:17:40.826 --> 00:17:41.960
Huh?

00:17:42.027 --> 00:17:43.729
How do you know my husband?

00:17:46.865 --> 00:17:47.933
Um...

00:17:51.437 --> 00:17:52.704
Don't ever...

00:17:54.406 --> 00:17:56.442
come looking for us again.

00:18:56.869 --> 00:18:57.970
Huh? My keys.

00:18:58.737 --> 00:19:01.340
No way. My keys.

00:19:03.942 --> 00:19:05.677
Where are my keys?

00:19:06.812 --> 00:19:07.880
Mitsuhiro.

00:19:08.947 --> 00:19:09.948
Maya.

00:19:11.817 --> 00:19:13.552
You don't have your keys?

00:19:13.619 --> 00:19:15.287
Huh? Were you watching me?

00:19:17.422 --> 00:19:18.991
For around five seconds.

00:19:19.558 --> 00:19:20.926
What?

00:19:20.993 --> 00:19:23.262
You should've said something.

00:19:27.466 --> 00:19:28.767
Did you work late too?

00:19:30.102 --> 00:19:32.070
No, um...

00:19:34.339 --> 00:19:35.541
What happened?

00:19:41.747 --> 00:19:42.781
Um...

00:19:44.683 --> 00:19:45.717
Well, I...

00:19:51.590 --> 00:19:53.125
No, it's nothing.

00:19:56.762 --> 00:19:57.863
A bike.

00:20:07.339 --> 00:20:09.308
Maya, do you have a key?

00:20:09.374 --> 00:20:10.909
Yeah, I do.

00:20:12.477 --> 00:20:14.613
THANK YOU FOR EVERYTHING.
PLEASE ENJOY

00:20:14.680 --> 00:20:15.681
KANA TORII

00:20:22.287 --> 00:20:23.655
Komoto, a word?

00:20:23.722 --> 00:20:24.756
Sure.

00:20:24.823 --> 00:20:26.325
This is from Torii.

00:20:26.391 --> 00:20:27.726
She said it's for you.

00:20:27.793 --> 00:20:29.494
What? From Kana?

00:20:29.561 --> 00:20:30.562
Yeah.

00:20:32.231 --> 00:20:35.067
IT'S THE SAME PERFUME AS MINE

00:20:35.133 --> 00:20:37.135
Did she wear a perfume?

00:20:38.437 --> 00:20:39.671
Not sure.

00:20:52.017 --> 00:20:53.151
A bike.

00:20:58.924 --> 00:21:00.459
It's perfume.

00:21:02.194 --> 00:21:04.029
Do you know where she's working now?

00:21:04.863 --> 00:21:07.699
Katsuta Holdings. Amazing, right?

00:21:08.700 --> 00:21:09.968
What?

00:21:10.035 --> 00:21:14.172
We'd like to cancel
the offer from Katsuta Holdings.

00:21:14.239 --> 00:21:16.108
We got an email.

00:21:16.174 --> 00:21:17.542
Who would do that?

00:22:11.196 --> 00:22:12.931
I died.

00:22:12.998 --> 00:22:16.234
It's okay. I'll revive you.

00:22:24.142 --> 00:22:25.277
Die!

00:22:26.378 --> 00:22:27.412
Die!

00:22:28.313 --> 00:22:29.715
Die!

00:22:29.781 --> 00:22:31.216
Die!

00:22:31.283 --> 00:22:32.351
Die!

00:22:32.417 --> 00:22:34.753
Die! Die!

00:22:34.820 --> 00:22:39.691
Die, die, die!

00:22:52.771 --> 00:22:57.976
Maya, We need to talk

00:23:12.023 --> 00:23:13.158
Maya?

00:23:23.535 --> 00:23:24.569
It was all...

00:23:26.271 --> 00:23:27.706
you.

00:23:32.844 --> 00:23:34.613
That took you a while.

00:23:39.484 --> 00:23:41.019
Why?

00:23:42.053 --> 00:23:43.555
Why would you do this?

00:23:45.557 --> 00:23:49.027
I hate you, you know.

00:23:50.295 --> 00:23:51.296
What?

00:23:54.499 --> 00:23:56.067
I hate people like you.

00:23:57.135 --> 00:23:58.770
Selfish...

00:23:59.571 --> 00:24:01.273
living in your own bubble.

00:24:03.108 --> 00:24:05.210
- Right.
- How about using this instead?

00:24:05.277 --> 00:24:07.245
It'll cut down on a lot.

00:24:07.312 --> 00:24:09.014
Oh, that's true.

00:24:09.080 --> 00:24:11.516
- Got it.
- I'll go ask.

00:24:11.583 --> 00:24:14.719
Everyone loves you at work

00:24:14.786 --> 00:24:16.822
and your career was going well.

00:24:16.888 --> 00:24:19.291
- You have a nice home.
- Oh, thank you.

00:24:19.357 --> 00:24:23.728
Everything in your private life
was picture-perfect too.

00:24:26.031 --> 00:24:27.799
I love your bar counter.

00:24:27.866 --> 00:24:29.568
I'm a big fan of it.

00:24:29.634 --> 00:24:31.303
Yeah, it's so stylish.

00:24:31.369 --> 00:24:33.672
Can you get me the long chopsticks?

00:24:33.738 --> 00:24:35.140
Oh, sure.

00:24:35.207 --> 00:24:37.108
- Here.
- Thank you.

00:24:37.175 --> 00:24:38.844
Let's see...

00:24:38.910 --> 00:24:40.745
- Um...
- Yes?

00:24:41.646 --> 00:24:43.949
That's Abyss, isn't it?

00:24:45.450 --> 00:24:46.451
Huh?

00:24:48.153 --> 00:24:51.089
- You know about it?
- Yes.

00:24:51.656 --> 00:24:53.992
I play Dark Leader too.

00:24:55.427 --> 00:24:57.329
Yurika
I want my husband dead already!

00:24:57.395 --> 00:24:59.698
How are things with you?

00:25:11.409 --> 00:25:13.111
I know that feeling.

00:25:23.522 --> 00:25:25.557
You're amazing, Mitsuhiro.

00:25:28.460 --> 00:25:30.795
Right back at you, Kana.

00:25:30.862 --> 00:25:33.598
All right, let's head east next.

00:25:36.968 --> 00:25:38.069
Hey.

00:25:38.904 --> 00:25:39.938
Yeah?

00:25:40.539 --> 00:25:44.509
What's Maya like at work?

00:25:48.780 --> 00:25:50.815
Maya's...

00:25:51.550 --> 00:25:54.386
a capable, kind senior of mine.

00:25:55.420 --> 00:25:56.655
Kind...

00:25:57.789 --> 00:25:59.057
I see.

00:26:00.992 --> 00:26:02.227
Are you surprised?

00:26:06.031 --> 00:26:09.467
Well, she does say
"I want him to die" sometimes.

00:26:10.602 --> 00:26:12.037
"Die"?

00:26:14.039 --> 00:26:15.173
Who does she want dead?

00:26:20.745 --> 00:26:21.980
Is it...

00:26:24.015 --> 00:26:25.083
me?

00:26:58.350 --> 00:27:00.885
Mitsuhiro was hurt.

00:27:24.509 --> 00:27:27.679
Did something good happen then?

00:27:27.746 --> 00:27:29.781
- And yet you...
- No, not really.

00:27:29.848 --> 00:27:33.251
looked relieved at work
when your husband disappeared.

00:27:37.288 --> 00:27:39.190
Um, excuse me then.

00:27:39.257 --> 00:27:41.559
- Thank you. See you around.
- Yes.

00:27:47.432 --> 00:27:50.235
Let's send that photo to Maya.

00:27:50.301 --> 00:27:52.771
TO MAYA KOMOTO

00:28:06.317 --> 00:28:08.620
Let me send it for you then.

00:28:19.931 --> 00:28:22.100
SENT

00:28:26.905 --> 00:28:28.006
You didn't stop me.

00:28:36.014 --> 00:28:38.416
That's why I was comforting him.

00:28:41.920 --> 00:28:46.091
I like taking care of older men
when they're feeling down.

00:28:47.992 --> 00:28:50.562
They're like abandoned puppies.

00:28:51.763 --> 00:28:55.033
I love those eyes
when they cling to you.

00:28:58.169 --> 00:28:59.537
Are you serious?

00:29:01.439 --> 00:29:03.408
Do you know what you just did?

00:29:04.242 --> 00:29:06.478
You have no right to attack me.

00:29:09.047 --> 00:29:11.850
It's your fault
he ended up like that.

00:29:15.687 --> 00:29:17.589
You'd better be careful

00:29:19.224 --> 00:29:21.292
or he might kill you.

00:30:35.066 --> 00:30:37.335
TWO CONTACTS DELETED

00:30:42.040 --> 00:30:44.742
Telling each other to die...
What a weird couple.

00:31:12.170 --> 00:31:13.371
Welcome home, Maya.

00:31:21.779 --> 00:31:23.414
Is something wrong?

00:31:27.685 --> 00:31:28.686
No.

00:31:30.421 --> 00:31:35.159
Hey, are you free this weekend?

00:31:37.562 --> 00:31:39.130
Yeah.

00:31:39.197 --> 00:31:42.934
Then let's go camping
in the mountains.

00:31:43.968 --> 00:31:45.003
The mountains?

00:31:46.971 --> 00:31:48.273
Why?

00:31:48.339 --> 00:31:49.874
What do you mean?

00:31:51.442 --> 00:31:54.946
There's a place
I've always wanted to take you.

00:31:56.915 --> 00:31:58.116
Is that a no?

00:32:04.589 --> 00:32:06.791
Okay, let's go.

00:32:07.926 --> 00:32:08.927
Great.

00:32:30.048 --> 00:32:33.017
Everything ended up well
for you, didn't it, Yurika?

00:32:33.084 --> 00:32:34.819
It was hard though, huh?

00:32:36.187 --> 00:32:39.190
I sold the house
and got plenty of alimony.

00:32:39.257 --> 00:32:41.592
Yuna and I are gonna live
comfortably now.

00:32:41.659 --> 00:32:42.727
I see.

00:32:42.794 --> 00:32:44.262
Oh, right.

00:32:44.329 --> 00:32:47.498
When this baby's born,
I'm gonna ask you for advice, okay?

00:32:47.565 --> 00:32:49.100
Of course.

00:32:49.167 --> 00:32:50.902
Let's work together as new moms.

00:32:51.536 --> 00:32:52.870
It's tough though.

00:32:52.937 --> 00:32:55.506
- Is it?
- But you'll be fine.

00:32:56.941 --> 00:32:58.309
What about you, Maya?

00:32:58.376 --> 00:33:00.778
What are you going to do
about Mitsuhiro?

00:33:00.845 --> 00:33:02.013
I'm...

00:33:03.114 --> 00:33:04.349
Did something happen?

00:33:04.415 --> 00:33:06.918
Are you okay?
Tell us if you're having problems.

00:33:06.985 --> 00:33:09.487
Yeah, we'll do anything to help.

00:33:11.956 --> 00:33:13.124
To be honest

00:33:13.925 --> 00:33:17.762
I decided to start over
with Mitsuhiro.

00:33:20.064 --> 00:33:21.265
I had no idea.

00:33:22.400 --> 00:33:24.202
Sorry for worrying you.

00:33:26.037 --> 00:33:28.773
You're okay with him cheating on you?

00:33:28.840 --> 00:33:29.841
Yeah...

00:33:30.742 --> 00:33:34.178
After everything I found out,
I decided to accept it.

00:33:34.245 --> 00:33:35.580
I see.

00:33:35.646 --> 00:33:37.148
So that means

00:33:37.215 --> 00:33:40.785
everything went well
without any of our husbands dying.

00:33:40.852 --> 00:33:42.587
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

00:33:42.653 --> 00:33:44.756
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

00:33:52.463 --> 00:33:54.866
Are you packed for tomorrow?

00:33:56.401 --> 00:33:57.668
Yeah.

00:33:57.735 --> 00:33:59.203
Okay then.

00:34:00.638 --> 00:34:04.409
I'll see you tomorrow then.
Good night.

00:34:05.443 --> 00:34:06.677
Good night.

00:34:55.159 --> 00:34:56.327
What is it?

00:35:14.645 --> 00:35:16.047
Want to sleep together?

00:36:13.004 --> 00:36:15.006
It's so cramped.

00:36:23.481 --> 00:36:24.649
Good morning.

00:36:25.616 --> 00:36:26.717
Good morning.

00:36:47.371 --> 00:36:48.806
Ready?

00:36:50.808 --> 00:36:51.809
Yeah.

00:38:26.037 --> 00:38:29.573
FINAL EPISODE PREVIEW

00:38:35.313 --> 00:38:37.381
PLEASE DIE MY BELOVED

00:38:39.016 --> 00:38:41.919
MY DESTINED ONE
