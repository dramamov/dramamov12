The Sengoku Weekly.

00:00:14.414 --> 00:00:16.816
One of Japan's top weekly tabloids.

00:00:20.086 --> 00:00:23.957
But I'm not interested
in buying it at all.

00:00:24.457 --> 00:00:27.060
Honestly, it's more vulgar
than talk shows,

00:00:27.127 --> 00:00:30.030
and I feel like they add fake stories
to boost sales.

00:00:30.597 --> 00:00:33.099
Do tabloids have no morals?

00:00:33.166 --> 00:00:35.201
Does Sengokusha have no class?

00:00:35.935 --> 00:00:39.272
I've never had a favorable opinion
of this rag.

00:00:41.041 --> 00:00:44.878
If I worked at one of Sengokusha's
rival companies instead,

00:00:45.378 --> 00:00:49.049
could I have worked with
Titi's Matomi Ishikawa?

00:00:49.849 --> 00:00:52.485
A comforting smile, clear eyes,

00:00:53.353 --> 00:00:55.688
I'm sure she has a pure soul.

00:01:01.061 --> 00:01:02.462
Are my eyes

00:01:03.096 --> 00:01:04.964
not tainted yet?

00:01:08.868 --> 00:01:09.936
Hinako Shinoda.

00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:11.538
Age 24.

00:01:12.205 --> 00:01:15.241
I miraculously joined the major publisher
Sengokusha Inc. last year,

00:01:15.809 --> 00:01:19.679
and was put on the editorial staff
in charge of a free monthly zine,

00:01:19.746 --> 00:01:22.582
starting my lifelong dream in publishing.

00:01:24.584 --> 00:01:25.485
And yet.

00:01:27.153 --> 00:01:30.423
Life takes unexpected turns.

00:01:30.924 --> 00:01:31.925
SOLD OUT

00:01:34.527 --> 00:01:35.695
Currently,

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:39.766
I find myself on the Incident team
of Sengoku Weekly.

00:01:39.833 --> 00:01:41.668
Something I wanted no part of.

00:01:45.205 --> 00:01:46.439
I never thought

00:01:46.973 --> 00:01:51.544
I would be spending my days
searching for gossip stories.

00:01:52.579 --> 00:01:54.347
These last six months,

00:01:54.414 --> 00:01:58.585
my required five or six ideas
have always been rejected.

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:18.538
I'm terribly sorry!

00:02:18.605 --> 00:02:19.839
Like I said.

00:02:19.906 --> 00:02:22.342
Let me talk to your supervisor.

00:02:22.408 --> 00:02:25.645
We often get complaints
on the release date.

00:02:26.379 --> 00:02:29.082
You're useless,
get me the editor-in-chief.

00:02:29.149 --> 00:02:32.118
The chief is out,
and I don't know when he'll return.

00:02:32.185 --> 00:02:33.019
Screw that.

00:02:33.086 --> 00:02:35.388
Your article is going to end my business.

00:02:35.455 --> 00:02:36.990
Put the writer on the line.

00:02:37.056 --> 00:02:39.159
I can't do that.

00:02:39.225 --> 00:02:40.793
Then give me his source.

00:02:41.394 --> 00:02:43.296
I can't do that either.

00:02:43.363 --> 00:02:46.566
I bet you just bought some random article
and published it.

00:02:46.633 --> 00:02:47.967
Are you listening?

00:02:48.034 --> 00:02:50.336
I'm sorry, I dropped my script.

00:02:50.403 --> 00:02:53.606
What? You're dealing with me
using a script?

00:02:53.673 --> 00:02:55.308
No, of course not.

00:02:55.375 --> 00:02:56.943
I'm terribly sorry!

00:02:58.745 --> 00:03:00.680
Why do you guys even exist?

00:03:01.981 --> 00:03:05.185
Is it fun ruining other people's lives?

00:03:05.251 --> 00:03:09.889
As long as you work there, you're just as
guilty as the writer who ruined my life.

00:03:26.839 --> 00:03:29.008
THE MEANING OF A TABLOID'S EXISTENCE

00:03:30.009 --> 00:03:31.911
Was everything okay with that complaint?

00:03:31.978 --> 00:03:32.879
Yeah.

00:03:33.446 --> 00:03:35.582
Remember what I told you?

00:03:37.483 --> 00:03:40.520
Um, to record the conversation, and…

00:03:41.321 --> 00:03:43.189
Tell them you're calling the police.

00:03:43.756 --> 00:03:46.793
Only report to Desk about
what you think isn't a prank.

00:03:48.595 --> 00:03:49.495
Excuse me.

00:03:50.997 --> 00:03:53.166
The content of this article
is true, right?

00:03:54.701 --> 00:03:55.969
It's been verified.

00:03:56.970 --> 00:03:59.205
We'd be crazy if we made everything up.

00:04:00.473 --> 00:04:03.142
Although, that's what the world thinks.

00:04:03.910 --> 00:04:05.378
Tsukasa Yamabuki,

00:04:05.445 --> 00:04:07.547
he's a journalist for Sengoku Weekly.

00:04:08.314 --> 00:04:10.383
After I was assigned here,

00:04:10.450 --> 00:04:14.654
I judged him for writing
such gossip articles,

00:04:14.721 --> 00:04:17.657
but I learned he has
a surprisingly sensible side.

00:04:22.662 --> 00:04:25.098
Handling calls is hard.

00:04:25.164 --> 00:04:28.401
I'm more scared of pitch meetings
than of handling complaints.

00:04:28.468 --> 00:04:29.636
I get that.

00:04:29.702 --> 00:04:31.738
Five or six ideas a week is impossible.

00:04:32.438 --> 00:04:34.974
I always thought they outsourced more.

00:04:35.541 --> 00:04:36.609
Kengo Akutsu.

00:04:36.676 --> 00:04:38.044
It's his first year here.

00:04:38.111 --> 00:04:40.947
A baby-faced man
who reliably never loses his appetite

00:04:41.014 --> 00:04:42.649
no matter what happens.

00:04:42.715 --> 00:04:43.650
Want some?

00:04:43.716 --> 00:04:44.951
No thanks.

00:04:49.922 --> 00:04:53.526
The Incident Team also employs
contract employees.

00:04:54.460 --> 00:04:56.396
The veteran writer, Mr. Murai.

00:04:56.462 --> 00:04:59.098
The well-informed, Daisuke Tsubaki.

00:04:59.165 --> 00:05:01.434
The in-house photographer, Mr. Suzaki.

00:05:02.168 --> 00:05:04.370
And the one leading the six of us…

00:05:05.638 --> 00:05:07.006
- Good morning.
- Morning.

00:05:07.740 --> 00:05:10.843
…is Mr. Kitahama, our chief,
whom we call Desk.

00:05:10.910 --> 00:05:14.080
Okay, let's have Shinoda
start off with the pitches.

00:05:15.315 --> 00:05:16.215
Yes, sir.

00:05:16.282 --> 00:05:17.850
I have five in total.

00:05:18.484 --> 00:05:22.789
The first one, there's a park
where expensive breeds of dogs gather.

00:05:22.855 --> 00:05:24.190
- Next.
- I'm not finished.

00:05:24.257 --> 00:05:25.391
Move on. Number two.

00:05:27.126 --> 00:05:30.863
Number two, according to
a former yoga school student,

00:05:30.930 --> 00:05:34.500
housewives are ruthlessly running
through young instructors.

00:05:34.567 --> 00:05:35.902
Lacks punch. Next.

00:05:35.968 --> 00:05:38.771
In Akasaka, there's a dentist
who's accused of sexual harassment.

00:05:39.806 --> 00:05:41.908
We did that two years ago. Next.

00:05:41.974 --> 00:05:45.411
There's a crying mannequin
at a long-standing clothing shop.

00:05:45.478 --> 00:05:49.148
That's not because of some
leaky ceiling, right?

00:05:49.215 --> 00:05:50.450
You knew already?

00:05:50.516 --> 00:05:52.752
No, I just guessed. That's really it?

00:05:52.819 --> 00:05:53.720
Yes.

00:05:54.320 --> 00:05:57.423
But, you know, it really does look creepy.

00:05:57.490 --> 00:05:59.959
Last one, give me something
that hits hard.

00:06:01.594 --> 00:06:03.363
There's a rumor in Ota

00:06:05.264 --> 00:06:07.166
that a man who feeds pigeons there

00:06:09.435 --> 00:06:12.305
might actually be an extraterrestrial.

00:06:17.810 --> 00:06:18.678
Akutsu, you're up.

00:06:18.745 --> 00:06:19.779
Yes, sir.

00:06:19.846 --> 00:06:22.181
I learned that the actor
playing a popular mascot

00:06:22.248 --> 00:06:25.251
used to work as an actor
for a rival mascot.

00:06:25.318 --> 00:06:26.819
Sorry, say that again.

00:06:33.092 --> 00:06:35.695
This is the PR zine
my old department puts out.

00:06:35.762 --> 00:06:39.232
I used to work on the preface
and other features,

00:06:39.298 --> 00:06:43.169
but I haven't done anything
since coming to the Sengoku Weekly.

00:06:44.003 --> 00:06:45.138
I get that.

00:06:45.204 --> 00:06:46.372
It's tough.

00:06:46.439 --> 00:06:48.274
You're way better off.

00:06:48.341 --> 00:06:50.076
You got one pitch approved.

00:06:51.244 --> 00:06:55.648
I want to find a story
that actually gets an article soon.

00:07:05.925 --> 00:07:07.660
You've reached Sengoku Weekly.

00:07:09.295 --> 00:07:10.463
I have a scoop.

00:07:12.231 --> 00:07:13.566
What kind of scoop?

00:07:14.767 --> 00:07:17.703
Do you know the idol group Titi?

00:07:17.770 --> 00:07:20.106
Yes, the super popular group!

00:07:20.873 --> 00:07:23.309
It's about their member Matomi.

00:07:24.076 --> 00:07:25.912
Matomi Ishikawa, correct?

00:07:25.978 --> 00:07:26.813
Yes.

00:07:27.380 --> 00:07:29.115
Good, I can get to the point then.

00:07:29.182 --> 00:07:30.983
What about Matomin?

00:07:31.918 --> 00:07:32.985
I have a picture.

00:07:34.387 --> 00:07:35.254
A picture?

00:07:36.322 --> 00:07:37.790
What kind of picture?

00:07:38.391 --> 00:07:39.659
We used to date.

00:07:39.725 --> 00:07:41.661
I have a compromising photo
from that time.

00:07:44.297 --> 00:07:47.099
How much would Sengoku Weekly pay for it?

00:07:49.001 --> 00:07:50.837
This has really escalated.

00:07:52.438 --> 00:07:54.440
I need the script!

00:07:55.441 --> 00:07:58.811
Wait, there's no script
for a guy exploiting a girl's past.

00:07:58.878 --> 00:07:59.712
Hello?

00:08:03.216 --> 00:08:07.787
Would you be willing to send
one of the photos beforehand?

00:08:07.854 --> 00:08:12.024
Would you like to text instead
to save the cost of the call?

00:08:12.091 --> 00:08:14.861
I'll send you my card and ID photo.

00:08:16.696 --> 00:08:18.664
Really? Sounds good.

00:08:20.266 --> 00:08:22.335
Should I really take charge?

00:08:24.003 --> 00:08:25.972
Kitahama gave you the green light.

00:08:26.839 --> 00:08:29.609
But what if
it really is a scandalous photo?

00:08:30.243 --> 00:08:34.113
The first thing you have to do
is determine if it's real or not.

00:08:34.747 --> 00:08:38.184
In order to do that,
you have to approach the source

00:08:38.251 --> 00:08:39.585
and get the photo.

00:08:39.652 --> 00:08:45.291
Then you gather as much evidence
as you can to determine its validity.

00:08:45.858 --> 00:08:49.662
Sorry won't cut it
if we print something that's fake.

00:08:52.431 --> 00:08:53.366
What's wrong?

00:08:54.300 --> 00:08:56.936
Just try to make your own moves for now.

00:08:57.003 --> 00:08:58.838
You finally got an interesting lead.

00:08:59.672 --> 00:09:01.407
I don't think it's interesting at all.

00:09:03.342 --> 00:09:04.944
If the photo's real,

00:09:05.011 --> 00:09:07.547
Matomi won't be able to
stay an idol anymore.

00:09:07.613 --> 00:09:12.018
She'll lose trust, her sponsors,
and her roles on TV.

00:09:12.084 --> 00:09:13.686
Are you okay with that?

00:09:21.460 --> 00:09:22.295
Look,

00:09:23.896 --> 00:09:26.232
try not to think too seriously about it.

00:09:28.568 --> 00:09:34.874
Because deciding whether or not
to run the story is the chief's job.

00:09:38.644 --> 00:09:41.047
But if you're not confident,

00:09:41.113 --> 00:09:44.684
I can ask Desk to put someone else on it.

00:09:45.451 --> 00:09:46.619
No, I'll do it!

00:09:50.089 --> 00:09:51.357
Please let me do this.

00:09:55.227 --> 00:09:57.163
Well then, good luck.

00:10:02.501 --> 00:10:03.669
MATOMI ISHIKAWA

00:10:08.507 --> 00:10:09.342
Okay!

00:10:14.914 --> 00:10:16.415
I WOULD LIKE TO MEET YOU

00:10:16.482 --> 00:10:17.717
I've got a scoop.

00:10:21.787 --> 00:10:22.688
TOMORROW?

00:10:22.755 --> 00:10:23.689
I've got a scoop!

00:10:25.291 --> 00:10:26.492
I've got a scoop!

00:10:34.066 --> 00:10:36.636
The day has finally come for me to act.

00:10:37.637 --> 00:10:39.639
I don't want to swing and miss.

00:10:40.539 --> 00:10:42.508
I don't want this to be fake.

00:10:44.010 --> 00:10:44.877
But

00:10:46.579 --> 00:10:48.848
I also don't want to be the one

00:10:48.914 --> 00:10:53.019
to ruin a 17 year old girl's life
by throwing her into the deep end.

00:10:55.755 --> 00:10:57.156
Am I on the brink

00:10:57.223 --> 00:11:01.260
of joining a heinous group of people
I once held such contempt for?

00:11:01.327 --> 00:11:02.261
CAFE CROWN

00:11:03.329 --> 00:11:06.399
No, I'll first listen to
what he has to say.

00:11:16.175 --> 00:11:20.846
Thank you for coming to meet me so soon.

00:11:24.283 --> 00:11:26.385
Who is the one who called me?

00:11:29.455 --> 00:11:31.357
So you dated Matomi?

00:11:32.158 --> 00:11:35.828
We started going out in grade eight,
hanging out at our homes.

00:11:36.395 --> 00:11:38.464
According to official sources,

00:11:39.198 --> 00:11:42.601
Matomi first auditioned in the winter
of her eighth-grade year.

00:11:43.235 --> 00:11:46.072
Which means you witnessed all that
first-hand.

00:11:47.339 --> 00:11:48.441
She had my support.

00:11:48.507 --> 00:11:51.777
What was she like while auditioning?

00:11:51.844 --> 00:11:53.279
Did she tell you anything?

00:11:55.414 --> 00:11:58.451
She said she wouldn't change.

00:11:58.517 --> 00:12:02.788
You mean you two would continue
dating as boyfriend and girlfriend?

00:12:09.161 --> 00:12:11.564
But that didn't happen, did it?

00:12:14.934 --> 00:12:16.902
Did something happen?

00:12:17.803 --> 00:12:21.807
One day she suddenly told me
to stop texting and calling her.

00:12:22.875 --> 00:12:25.711
I got really bitter about it.

00:12:26.345 --> 00:12:27.513
I wanted revenge.

00:12:30.282 --> 00:12:32.852
That's why I've got the pictures.

00:12:37.690 --> 00:12:41.794
Could you show me
the photos in question then?

00:13:05.317 --> 00:13:07.019
The last picture is really bad.

00:13:08.921 --> 00:13:11.056
It's a little blurry.

00:13:28.707 --> 00:13:30.609
You can tell it's the same place, right?

00:13:30.676 --> 00:13:31.911
Oh, right.

00:13:35.581 --> 00:13:37.016
Are you okay?

00:13:37.583 --> 00:13:39.185
Yes, sorry. Um…

00:13:40.820 --> 00:13:43.322
Could I borrow this picture?

00:13:48.828 --> 00:13:52.898
Then please bring
that crucial third picture again tomorrow.

00:13:53.465 --> 00:13:55.401
At least let me borrow these two.

00:13:56.068 --> 00:13:59.471
I'll need them to convince my chief,
or things will take more time.

00:13:59.538 --> 00:14:02.041
Do we get our fee tomorrow then?

00:14:03.742 --> 00:14:06.645
I didn't bring it with me today.

00:14:07.746 --> 00:14:11.984
I will give it to you tomorrow
in exchange for the third picture.

00:14:15.354 --> 00:14:17.089
While it isn't much…

00:14:23.495 --> 00:14:24.797
For transportation.

00:14:33.806 --> 00:14:34.640
Nice.

00:14:34.707 --> 00:14:35.674
It's Matomin.

00:14:36.208 --> 00:14:37.076
The real deal.

00:14:37.676 --> 00:14:39.912
Did anything feel off?

00:14:41.046 --> 00:14:43.315
I tried asking them lots of questions.

00:14:44.416 --> 00:14:45.317
Like…

00:14:50.089 --> 00:14:51.790
I asked what class they were in.

00:14:52.491 --> 00:14:55.461
They said that they were in class two
in eighth grade

00:14:55.527 --> 00:14:58.197
while Matomin was in class one.

00:14:58.264 --> 00:15:00.566
I also asked about their homes.

00:15:00.633 --> 00:15:03.903
Matomin lived in a large,
white apartment building.

00:15:03.969 --> 00:15:08.140
They didn't remember the name
or the floor she lived on.

00:15:08.207 --> 00:15:09.875
But towards the upper level.

00:15:10.509 --> 00:15:12.878
He went over there once or twice,

00:15:12.945 --> 00:15:16.315
but she mostly came to his home.

00:15:17.483 --> 00:15:19.885
That's about all I was able to ask.

00:15:23.355 --> 00:15:25.090
The answers are pretty vague.

00:15:25.958 --> 00:15:28.861
Yes, but there wasn't much I could say
to prove otherwise.

00:15:29.795 --> 00:15:31.330
I'll check the validity then.

00:15:31.864 --> 00:15:33.532
I know a writer who knows idols.

00:15:34.266 --> 00:15:36.769
- I'll ask him about Matomin.
- You will?

00:15:37.469 --> 00:15:38.671
Thank you!

00:15:38.737 --> 00:15:41.473
We'll also need to check
if the photos are real.

00:15:41.540 --> 00:15:42.374
Yeah.

00:15:42.441 --> 00:15:46.545
Wait, do you mean they're likely fake?

00:15:46.612 --> 00:15:48.347
It's always possible.

00:15:51.684 --> 00:15:55.988
I can't imagine Matomi Ishikawa
smoking cigarettes.

00:15:56.055 --> 00:15:57.990
Her voice is so beautiful.

00:15:58.057 --> 00:15:59.391
Plus, she's a minor.

00:16:01.794 --> 00:16:02.761
What are you doing?

00:16:02.828 --> 00:16:08.033
If Matomin really smokes,
her teeth should be yellow.

00:16:08.767 --> 00:16:11.337
Those photos have definitely
been touched up.

00:16:11.403 --> 00:16:12.371
True.

00:16:13.405 --> 00:16:15.874
Then maybe a personal photo
could show them!

00:16:16.642 --> 00:16:18.344
It'd be nice if this weren't fake.

00:16:18.410 --> 00:16:21.180
There aren't many pictures
with her teeth showing.

00:16:22.081 --> 00:16:25.117
She's cute when she's sexy, too!

00:16:31.357 --> 00:16:32.291
Huh?

00:16:33.525 --> 00:16:34.360
Wait.

00:16:34.927 --> 00:16:36.261
Hold on a second!

00:16:36.328 --> 00:16:37.563
What? Hold on!

00:16:37.629 --> 00:16:38.697
Hold on!

00:16:41.200 --> 00:16:42.468
What is it?

00:16:53.312 --> 00:16:55.447
Yes… Okay.

00:16:56.015 --> 00:16:57.082
Got it.

00:16:57.750 --> 00:16:58.717
Thanks.

00:16:59.785 --> 00:17:04.390
Matomin used to live on the first floor
of a low-rise apartment building.

00:17:05.824 --> 00:17:07.760
So it's definitely fake then.

00:17:07.826 --> 00:17:08.727
Shinoda.

00:17:09.495 --> 00:17:13.665
You gotta be fed up
with people trying to trick you.

00:17:13.732 --> 00:17:14.733
Yes, sir.

00:17:14.800 --> 00:17:18.570
If we write a story
based on a stupid fake tip,

00:17:18.637 --> 00:17:20.339
we could get sued,

00:17:20.406 --> 00:17:23.609
and worst case scenario,
the editor-in-chief gets sacked.

00:17:24.910 --> 00:17:27.379
Don't let your guard down next time!

00:17:27.446 --> 00:17:28.280
Yes, sir.

00:17:28.347 --> 00:17:30.249
But you did well to get evidence.

00:17:30.315 --> 00:17:33.218
It's thanks to Mr. Yamabuki's advice.

00:17:35.654 --> 00:17:38.924
You mean to gather as much evidence
as you can?

00:17:39.892 --> 00:17:43.429
But I wasn't able to figure out
they were lying at first.

00:17:44.263 --> 00:17:46.565
Even if your interviewing needs work,

00:17:46.632 --> 00:17:49.435
you made trustworthy people take action,

00:17:49.501 --> 00:17:52.504
presenting the information
they found openly,

00:17:52.571 --> 00:17:56.275
giving us what we need to determine
whether or not to publish.

00:17:57.810 --> 00:17:59.845
You learned something at least.

00:18:00.546 --> 00:18:03.082
Here. Keep this on your desk.

00:18:04.550 --> 00:18:05.684
Chin up.

00:18:05.751 --> 00:18:07.052
Night, everyone.

00:18:07.119 --> 00:18:08.754
- Good night.
- Good night.

00:18:09.655 --> 00:18:13.392
TITI'S MATOMI ISHIKAWA
A MINOR WHO'S SMOKING?

00:18:17.262 --> 00:18:19.798
THE MEANING OF A TABLOID'S EXISTENCE

00:18:29.108 --> 00:18:30.109
Ms. Shinoda?

00:18:32.010 --> 00:18:33.212
Been a while.

00:18:33.278 --> 00:18:34.446
Last time was the reunion.

00:18:34.513 --> 00:18:35.380
MASAKI KUWABARA

00:18:35.447 --> 00:18:36.482
Yeah.

00:18:36.548 --> 00:18:39.218
Rumors of you even reached
the art department.

00:18:41.286 --> 00:18:44.156
They scammed 10,000 yen out of me!

00:18:44.223 --> 00:18:46.625
It's not too bad
if that's all you've paid.

00:18:47.593 --> 00:18:48.594
{\an8}Tough break.

00:18:48.660 --> 00:18:49.661
{\an8}Thanks.

00:18:54.533 --> 00:18:55.868
{\an8}How're you feeling?

00:18:57.736 --> 00:18:59.738
{\an8}Better since my transfer.

00:19:00.973 --> 00:19:02.141
{\an8}That's good.

00:19:02.207 --> 00:19:04.276
{\an8}I'm in charge of a novel right now.

00:19:05.210 --> 00:19:08.180
{\an8}A social awareness mystery novel
sounding the alarm for Japan's future.

00:19:09.615 --> 00:19:12.017
{\an8}It's a different exhaustion from tabloids.

00:19:13.152 --> 00:19:15.387
{\an8}Why do tabloids even exist?

00:19:20.392 --> 00:19:23.095
{\an8}What's the purpose of tabloids?

00:19:28.700 --> 00:19:30.302
{\an8}Hello, Sengoku Weekly.

00:19:31.303 --> 00:19:32.738
{\an8}I have a scoop.

00:19:34.306 --> 00:19:35.807
{\an8}What kind of scoop?

00:19:37.042 --> 00:19:39.978
{\an8}I saw a cat holding a human hand
in its mouth.

00:19:40.045 --> 00:19:41.113
{\an8}A human hand?

00:19:42.114 --> 00:19:46.885
{\an8}I thought a tabloid might take action
on something like this.

00:19:48.320 --> 00:19:49.922
{\an8}TO BE CONTINUED

00:19:50.489 --> 00:19:52.157
Stupid Sengokusha!

00:19:52.224 --> 00:19:54.626
{\an8}Somehow, she's gone missing.

00:19:54.693 --> 00:19:56.361
{\an8}Kota Kubozuka, age 27.

00:19:56.428 --> 00:19:58.363
{\an8}I want you to go to Niigata tomorrow.

00:19:58.430 --> 00:20:01.800
{\an8}I didn't join a publisher
to do stuff like this.

00:20:01.867 --> 00:20:03.035
Listen!

00:20:03.101 --> 00:20:04.403
Your fit is on point today.

00:20:04.469 --> 00:20:05.904
