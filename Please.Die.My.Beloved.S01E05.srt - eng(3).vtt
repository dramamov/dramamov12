00:00:02.635 --> 00:00:04.571
If only you'd just die!

00:00:04.738 --> 00:00:08.074
I'll never forgive him
for cheating on me.

00:00:08.141 --> 00:00:10.977
If it was an email,
it might be an impersonation.

00:00:11.211 --> 00:00:12.212
An impersonation?

00:00:12.278 --> 00:00:13.279
Hello?

00:00:13.346 --> 00:00:14.581
This is Komoto.

00:00:14.781 --> 00:00:16.549
I'm sorry for calling at this hour.

00:00:16.616 --> 00:00:20.553
Actually, your husband might have
been involved in an incident.

00:00:20.954 --> 00:00:21.955
What?

00:00:40.106 --> 00:00:41.107
Here you go.

00:00:41.241 --> 00:00:42.609
Thank you.

00:00:42.776 --> 00:00:44.411
- Just one moment.
- Okay.

00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:51.051
Gosh, is this that funny to you?

00:00:51.418 --> 00:00:54.988
That ripping sound just cracks me up.

00:00:56.122 --> 00:00:59.726
It's cute,
like a grade schooler's first wallet.

00:00:59.993 --> 00:01:01.795
It's convenient.

00:01:03.897 --> 00:01:06.766
But maybe
I should change it out soon.

00:01:08.101 --> 00:01:09.836
I was thinking that.

00:01:11.704 --> 00:01:12.705
So here.

00:01:13.506 --> 00:01:14.507
What is it?

00:01:14.808 --> 00:01:16.042
Open it up.

00:01:16.476 --> 00:01:17.477
Okay.

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:32.025
This is for me?

00:01:32.692 --> 00:01:34.861
Yes, I want you to use it.

00:01:35.962 --> 00:01:36.963
Are you sure?

00:01:38.498 --> 00:01:39.499
Thank you.

00:01:40.633 --> 00:01:43.736
I'm a little sad to say goodbye
to that ripping sound, though.

00:01:45.105 --> 00:01:48.141
Wow, a wallet for adults.

00:01:48.274 --> 00:01:49.476
That's a weird thing to say.

00:02:05.959 --> 00:02:07.160
I'm sure of it.

00:02:08.294 --> 00:02:09.429
It's my husband's.

00:02:12.966 --> 00:02:14.300
Is that so?

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:18.805
What does this mean?

00:02:19.806 --> 00:02:22.442
This was found at Yumeoka Park.

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:24.711
Yumeoka Park?

00:02:26.112 --> 00:02:27.614
That's right by our house.

00:02:29.282 --> 00:02:30.283
Why?

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:33.786
We can't say anything for sure yet.

00:02:34.154 --> 00:02:36.756
But it's unlikely
he threw it away like this.

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:39.659
If a third party disposed of it there

00:02:39.959 --> 00:02:42.562
it's possible he was involved
in an incident.

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:44.831
An incident...

00:02:45.665 --> 00:02:50.036
We're now handling this
as an abnormal missing person case.

00:02:53.239 --> 00:02:54.574
That means...

00:02:56.509 --> 00:03:00.013
We'll bring in an investigator
to work on his case.

00:04:36.709 --> 00:04:39.545
PLEASE DIE MY BELOVED

00:04:41.581 --> 00:04:44.317
We'll let you know
if there's any progress.

00:04:44.784 --> 00:04:45.785
Thank you.

00:04:53.860 --> 00:04:56.362
She's oddly calm
given the circumstances.

00:05:00.733 --> 00:05:02.302
Can you do something for me?

00:05:04.037 --> 00:05:05.038
Yes?

00:05:06.472 --> 00:05:08.141
Please calm down, Mother.

00:05:08.207 --> 00:05:09.509
How can I?!

00:05:09.776 --> 00:05:12.111
They said he might be
caught up in something!

00:05:12.445 --> 00:05:14.414
How are you acting so calm?!

00:05:14.681 --> 00:05:15.948
This isn't normal!

00:05:16.382 --> 00:05:19.752
Anyway, let's wait
for the police to call us.

00:05:20.787 --> 00:05:23.356
I'll let you know
when I learn of anything.

00:05:24.857 --> 00:05:27.093
- Goodbye.
- Hey, wait a second!

00:05:32.598 --> 00:05:34.467
What on earth happened?

00:05:42.442 --> 00:05:45.445
All right! Get over here!

00:05:45.778 --> 00:05:47.113
Hey, come on!

00:05:49.482 --> 00:05:52.285
- There!
- Take this!

00:05:54.487 --> 00:05:55.822
You dumbass.

00:06:13.873 --> 00:06:14.874
Or perhaps...

00:06:45.438 --> 00:06:47.473
Was he getting revenge against me?

00:06:52.145 --> 00:06:56.549
If my husband
really is gone from this world...

00:07:00.052 --> 00:07:01.988
If only you'd just die!

00:07:06.859 --> 00:07:07.860
Let's stop.

00:07:09.328 --> 00:07:12.565
Dwelling on it won't solve anything.

00:07:20.373 --> 00:07:21.941
Hello? Mr. Takagi?

00:07:22.675 --> 00:07:23.709
This is Komoto.

00:07:25.077 --> 00:07:29.348
Can we move forward with the process?

00:07:30.650 --> 00:07:31.651
Yes.

00:07:32.785 --> 00:07:35.655
We can use fresh citrus,
mint, or something refreshing.

00:07:35.721 --> 00:07:36.823
- I'll...
- I'd love to use

00:07:36.889 --> 00:07:37.890
those kinds of scents.

00:07:37.957 --> 00:07:39.592
...focus on what's within my power.

00:07:39.659 --> 00:07:41.427
We could stock up on aroma beads.

00:07:44.764 --> 00:07:47.066
Kana, your idea earlier was great.

00:07:47.133 --> 00:07:48.434
- Really?
- Yes.

00:07:48.601 --> 00:07:50.670
It's all thanks to you.

00:07:50.736 --> 00:07:51.938
You're a huge help.

00:07:52.004 --> 00:07:53.739
- Hello!
- Hello.

00:07:53.806 --> 00:07:54.807
Good work today.

00:07:55.308 --> 00:07:56.542
Everything going well?

00:07:56.709 --> 00:07:58.478
- Yes, swimmingly.
- I see.

00:07:58.778 --> 00:08:01.781
If this works, it might turn
into a large-scale project

00:08:01.848 --> 00:08:04.250
for every Lifestyle Sales branch
in Japan.

00:08:04.584 --> 00:08:05.618
I expect great things.

00:08:05.685 --> 00:08:06.686
- Okay.
- Okay.

00:08:08.921 --> 00:08:11.390
Did you hear that, Maya?

00:08:11.491 --> 00:08:13.292
Every Lifestyle Branch in Japan!

00:08:13.359 --> 00:08:14.393
Oh, man!

00:08:14.527 --> 00:08:16.529
My motivation is shooting up.

00:08:22.068 --> 00:08:23.169
I'll be right back.

00:08:23.336 --> 00:08:24.337
Okay.

00:08:26.172 --> 00:08:28.007
Hello? Yurika, what is it?

00:08:28.341 --> 00:08:29.342
Maya.

00:08:29.408 --> 00:08:31.978
Please, come over right now.

00:08:33.613 --> 00:08:34.614
Please!

00:08:35.348 --> 00:08:36.816
SAKAKI

00:08:36.883 --> 00:08:37.884
What happened?

00:08:37.950 --> 00:08:38.951
Are you okay?

00:08:46.492 --> 00:08:47.560
Welcome.

00:08:48.761 --> 00:08:50.363
Thank you for coming.

00:08:56.569 --> 00:08:57.570
Where's Yuna?

00:08:58.871 --> 00:09:01.073
She's at my parents' house.

00:09:02.241 --> 00:09:03.242
What?

00:09:07.213 --> 00:09:08.314
Gosh.

00:09:09.282 --> 00:09:11.417
Maya. Riko.

00:09:12.952 --> 00:09:16.455
I'm happy to see you.
We haven't met since that night.

00:09:18.057 --> 00:09:19.058
What?

00:09:19.859 --> 00:09:22.028
What? Did you forget?

00:09:25.598 --> 00:09:26.766
You know, that day.

00:09:28.167 --> 00:09:31.671
Since. That. Day.

00:09:35.007 --> 00:09:38.377
Since. That. Day.

00:09:41.414 --> 00:09:43.583
You were holding duct tape.

00:09:47.453 --> 00:09:49.722
You were holding my legs.

00:09:55.861 --> 00:09:58.831
You three were trying to kill me,
weren't you?

00:10:01.133 --> 00:10:02.134
I actually

00:10:03.135 --> 00:10:04.637
remember everything.

00:10:09.275 --> 00:10:11.544
Were you planning
to bury me somewhere?

00:10:11.811 --> 00:10:13.879
Or submerge me somewhere?

00:10:15.147 --> 00:10:17.817
Either way, you almost killed me.

00:10:19.151 --> 00:10:20.953
- That's not--
- She said, "Die."

00:10:21.253 --> 00:10:22.254
Die.

00:10:22.321 --> 00:10:23.656
Just die already!

00:10:26.592 --> 00:10:28.761
That's what she said
before she shoved me.

00:10:30.096 --> 00:10:32.198
My wife tried to kill me.

00:10:35.668 --> 00:10:36.902
Those words...

00:10:37.970 --> 00:10:40.473
It's obviously
just a figure of speech.

00:10:44.810 --> 00:10:48.581
I really wished for him
to die back then.

00:10:49.982 --> 00:10:50.983
How?

00:10:51.050 --> 00:10:52.818
She really wished for it.

00:10:56.889 --> 00:10:59.625
You two are accomplices
in attempted murder.

00:10:59.859 --> 00:11:02.828
Wait, Yurika was so shaken

00:11:02.895 --> 00:11:05.431
she called us over for help.

00:11:05.665 --> 00:11:08.968
You woke up when we were
just about to call an ambulance.

00:11:09.301 --> 00:11:10.503
That's all that happened.

00:11:12.738 --> 00:11:15.441
Let's let the experts
decide what's true or not.

00:11:15.875 --> 00:11:19.879
I'm going to the police now
to file a complaint.

00:11:23.683 --> 00:11:26.152
I know where you work, by the way.

00:11:32.692 --> 00:11:35.961
Yurika's definitely getting charged
with a crime.

00:11:36.595 --> 00:11:39.165
I'm never letting her see Yuna again.

00:11:39.765 --> 00:11:40.766
Wait!

00:11:41.600 --> 00:11:43.936
Please don't go to the police.

00:11:44.904 --> 00:11:45.938
Maya.

00:11:46.605 --> 00:11:50.042
If you two aren't guilty,
this doesn't involve you, right?

00:11:51.677 --> 00:11:54.647
I apologize for taking up your time.

00:11:54.714 --> 00:11:55.948
You may go now.

00:12:12.998 --> 00:12:13.999
What can we do

00:12:15.167 --> 00:12:17.136
to stop you from suing Yurika?

00:12:20.873 --> 00:12:23.476
Well, let's see...

00:12:24.944 --> 00:12:28.047
Then how about this?

00:12:30.649 --> 00:12:33.853
You can mend this with money.
A settlement of sorts.

00:12:35.688 --> 00:12:39.358
Unfortunately,
Yurika doesn't have any money.

00:12:40.392 --> 00:12:41.393
Instead, I was thinking

00:12:41.994 --> 00:12:45.064
you two could pay up
as her accomplices.

00:12:49.769 --> 00:12:50.770
How much?

00:12:56.342 --> 00:12:57.343
Twenty million.

00:12:59.779 --> 00:13:02.248
Your deadline is two weeks.

00:13:02.748 --> 00:13:05.785
If you don't pay,
she'll never see her daughter again.

00:13:06.018 --> 00:13:07.720
- Wait--
- I'm done talking!

00:13:09.088 --> 00:13:11.891
And with that, you may go now.

00:13:23.435 --> 00:13:26.438
Can we really pay
ten million yen each?

00:13:27.106 --> 00:13:28.340
Are you serious?

00:13:28.674 --> 00:13:31.043
Paying him would mean
we're admitting our guilt.

00:13:31.577 --> 00:13:34.980
He might use that against us
for the rest of our lives.

00:13:36.448 --> 00:13:39.685
We have two weeks,
so we'll come up with some plans.

00:13:40.452 --> 00:13:41.654
Like what?

00:13:43.122 --> 00:13:45.691
For now, let's think about it at home

00:13:46.258 --> 00:13:48.861
and try to come up
with our own solutions.

00:14:08.714 --> 00:14:09.715
Hiroki.

00:14:10.049 --> 00:14:11.083
What are you doing?

00:14:12.451 --> 00:14:13.986
You promised not to leave the house.

00:14:14.787 --> 00:14:15.788
Let's go.

00:14:16.121 --> 00:14:18.490
Wait, hold on, Riko...

00:14:18.557 --> 00:14:20.893
It's okay, I'll get in touch later.

00:14:27.733 --> 00:14:28.801
Riko.

00:15:18.250 --> 00:15:20.619
Riko, dinner's ready.

00:15:21.820 --> 00:15:24.456
A delicious,
nutritionally balanced meal.

00:15:26.659 --> 00:15:27.660
Enjoy.

00:15:34.333 --> 00:15:35.501
Remember this padlock?

00:15:37.469 --> 00:15:39.571
It's a symbol of our love.

00:15:42.308 --> 00:15:44.076
Good thing we made two.

00:15:44.944 --> 00:15:45.978
It's a memento.

00:15:46.278 --> 00:15:48.047
Let's stop kidding ourselves.

00:15:49.348 --> 00:15:50.349
Let's talk.

00:15:51.283 --> 00:15:52.618
I told you, it's pointless.

00:15:53.519 --> 00:15:56.789
- Let's talk through our lawyers.
- I don't get it.

00:15:57.589 --> 00:15:58.657
Why?

00:15:59.191 --> 00:16:00.192
Why...

00:16:00.693 --> 00:16:01.961
Why are you talking like that?

00:16:02.027 --> 00:16:03.495
Like I said, I like him.

00:16:03.562 --> 00:16:05.064
No!

00:16:05.331 --> 00:16:07.199
Heart rate rising.

00:16:07.333 --> 00:16:08.567
No!

00:16:11.603 --> 00:16:12.838
No!

00:16:12.905 --> 00:16:14.473
No!

00:16:15.474 --> 00:16:16.742
Are you going to him now?

00:16:17.343 --> 00:16:18.344
No, the restroom.

00:16:22.314 --> 00:16:24.883
Enough already. This is imprisonment.

00:16:24.950 --> 00:16:26.986
What you're doing is insane!

00:16:30.956 --> 00:16:33.325
Why don't you understand?

00:16:34.960 --> 00:16:37.763
Heart rate has reached
180 beats per minute.

00:16:44.737 --> 00:16:47.740
Heart rate has reached
190 beats per minute.

00:16:54.680 --> 00:16:55.681
Maya.

00:16:55.814 --> 00:16:57.583
Oh, Kana. Good work today.

00:16:57.649 --> 00:16:59.084
You, too.

00:16:59.318 --> 00:17:00.319
Taking lunch?

00:17:00.652 --> 00:17:03.022
Yes, drafting those documents
took a while.

00:17:03.689 --> 00:17:04.723
Working hard, huh?

00:17:08.060 --> 00:17:10.229
Maya, is something on your mind?

00:17:10.729 --> 00:17:11.730
What?

00:17:12.564 --> 00:17:16.035
Well, I guess so, with this and that.

00:17:16.135 --> 00:17:17.169
That makes sense.

00:17:17.803 --> 00:17:19.371
You can complain to me if you want.

00:17:19.438 --> 00:17:20.506
You can tell me anything.

00:17:20.839 --> 00:17:21.840
Thank you.

00:17:22.408 --> 00:17:24.209
- We'll have a deep chat next time.
- Okay.

00:17:28.781 --> 00:17:30.082
Oh, no!

00:17:30.149 --> 00:17:32.418
SCHEDULE MEETING
WITH KATSUTA HOLDINGS

00:17:33.218 --> 00:17:36.455
Your renewal project
for Ortho was truly impressive.

00:17:37.689 --> 00:17:39.758
It was quite popular in the news

00:17:40.125 --> 00:17:41.660
and in our industry, too.

00:17:42.761 --> 00:17:43.896
Thank you.

00:17:44.196 --> 00:17:47.699
I heard that Kumabe Estate
has a traditional company culture.

00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:49.902
It must be tough for you.

00:17:51.036 --> 00:17:52.504
Well, yes.

00:17:53.272 --> 00:17:59.144
Your creativity and initiative
will truly shine at our company.

00:18:01.313 --> 00:18:05.784
The company won't judge you based on
sex, marital status, or motherhood.

00:18:05.851 --> 00:18:08.420
Your career ladder
will never get swiped away.

00:18:09.054 --> 00:18:10.656
I won't let that happen.

00:18:12.624 --> 00:18:13.725
Thank you.

00:18:23.402 --> 00:18:24.903
At a time like this

00:18:25.571 --> 00:18:27.940
I'm met
with both crisis and opportunity.

00:18:39.184 --> 00:18:41.653
YURIKA

00:19:25.330 --> 00:19:26.331
What?

00:19:32.504 --> 00:19:34.506
Yes, coming.

00:19:54.092 --> 00:19:56.261
Mother, please sit.

00:19:56.428 --> 00:19:57.429
You too, Saki.

00:19:58.931 --> 00:20:00.399
Where's my brother's room?

00:20:01.633 --> 00:20:03.402
Mitsuhiro doesn't have his own room.

00:20:04.203 --> 00:20:07.272
Our apartment
only has this room and a bedroom.

00:20:08.740 --> 00:20:09.875
Is that upstairs?

00:20:11.810 --> 00:20:14.379
Hey, don't just go up there.

00:20:14.646 --> 00:20:16.315
Is there something bad up there?

00:20:17.349 --> 00:20:18.383
Something bad?

00:20:19.451 --> 00:20:22.354
I mean, people don't normally
enter bedrooms without permission.

00:20:23.322 --> 00:20:26.124
This isn't a normal situation.

00:20:26.992 --> 00:20:28.126
Wait, hold on.

00:20:31.263 --> 00:20:32.264
Mother.

00:20:32.497 --> 00:20:34.800
Mother, what are you doing?

00:20:34.866 --> 00:20:35.901
Mother!

00:20:36.668 --> 00:20:37.703
What is this?

00:20:45.043 --> 00:20:46.178
Please stop.

00:20:47.879 --> 00:20:48.880
Where is he?

00:20:49.581 --> 00:20:50.582
What?

00:20:50.983 --> 00:20:55.487
You know where Mitsuhiro is,
don't you?

00:20:56.054 --> 00:20:57.256
I don't.

00:20:57.589 --> 00:20:59.424
I wish I knew too.

00:20:59.658 --> 00:21:00.659
You're lying.

00:21:00.826 --> 00:21:02.594
It's like Mom said.

00:21:02.961 --> 00:21:04.229
You're acting strange.

00:21:06.365 --> 00:21:08.567
Your own husband disappeared

00:21:08.900 --> 00:21:11.670
yet you're casually drinking
and ordering delivery.

00:21:12.604 --> 00:21:14.606
Well, this is...

00:21:14.973 --> 00:21:15.974
Maya.

00:21:17.309 --> 00:21:19.111
You're not worried, are you?

00:21:19.778 --> 00:21:21.013
Of course I am.

00:21:26.351 --> 00:21:27.753
You monster!

00:21:28.820 --> 00:21:30.389
Tell us the truth!

00:21:30.956 --> 00:21:32.858
Where is Mitsuhiro?!

00:21:32.924 --> 00:21:33.925
Mom!

00:21:35.227 --> 00:21:36.295
Tell me!

00:21:37.129 --> 00:21:39.598
My child...

00:21:41.400 --> 00:21:42.768
Is he alive?

00:21:45.537 --> 00:21:46.538
Mom!

00:21:46.972 --> 00:21:49.241
Mom, calm down!

00:21:51.677 --> 00:21:52.678
Mom.

00:21:53.979 --> 00:21:55.647
We have to pull ourselves together.

00:22:11.496 --> 00:22:14.166
There's nothing
particularly suspicious here.

00:22:15.100 --> 00:22:16.134
I see.

00:22:16.768 --> 00:22:18.270
No prior convictions?

00:22:19.204 --> 00:22:20.238
No.

00:22:20.605 --> 00:22:22.808
There was nothing in our systems.

00:22:30.215 --> 00:22:35.053
Those are definitely the eyes
of someone hiding something.

00:23:02.647 --> 00:23:03.849
Mom!

00:23:12.791 --> 00:23:13.925
Think.

00:23:15.727 --> 00:23:16.795
Think.

00:23:17.262 --> 00:23:20.699
Think...

00:23:33.779 --> 00:23:34.780
Wait a second.

00:23:39.985 --> 00:23:41.553
I took off work this week.

00:23:41.987 --> 00:23:42.988
What?

00:23:43.255 --> 00:23:44.456
We're stuck together.

00:23:47.893 --> 00:23:50.662
How long
are you going to keep this up?

00:23:51.730 --> 00:23:53.331
Until you break up with him

00:23:53.565 --> 00:23:54.933
and give up on the divorce.

00:23:58.003 --> 00:23:59.838
All right, let's talk.

00:24:02.207 --> 00:24:03.975
Okay, first

00:24:04.443 --> 00:24:07.345
let's think back on how we first met.

00:24:10.248 --> 00:24:12.818
We were both regulars
at the same sandwich shop

00:24:13.318 --> 00:24:17.489
and your earbud cord
got caught in mine.

00:24:18.890 --> 00:24:22.761
Oh, you were wearing
a pink trench coat, right?

00:24:23.662 --> 00:24:25.564
Yes, that's right.

00:24:30.502 --> 00:24:33.305
Why did I have to go through that?

00:24:36.374 --> 00:24:40.879
My husband was in the wrong
for leaving after having an affair.

00:24:42.514 --> 00:24:44.683
If only you'd just die!

00:24:51.056 --> 00:24:53.592
YUTO TAKAGI

00:24:54.793 --> 00:24:55.961
Really?

00:24:56.261 --> 00:25:00.031
Yes, they want
to officially offer you the position.

00:25:02.968 --> 00:25:04.503
Thank you.

00:25:04.769 --> 00:25:08.006
Would you like me to tell them
that you accept?

00:25:09.307 --> 00:25:11.243
Yes, thank you.

00:25:11.543 --> 00:25:12.544
Glad to hear it.

00:25:12.777 --> 00:25:15.146
I'll be in touch then.

00:25:15.213 --> 00:25:16.915
Yes, goodbye.

00:25:27.893 --> 00:25:28.960
Maya.

00:25:29.194 --> 00:25:31.997
Can you check the explanation flyers
I made for the tenants?

00:25:32.397 --> 00:25:33.398
Thank you.

00:25:46.511 --> 00:25:50.215
Maya, you're not leaving
the company, are you?

00:25:53.518 --> 00:25:55.020
What's this all of a sudden?

00:25:56.955 --> 00:25:59.791
The interview you did
for the recruitment website

00:26:00.592 --> 00:26:03.295
had your full name on it, right?

00:26:05.330 --> 00:26:09.367
I heard that means
you could get calls from headhunters.

00:26:11.102 --> 00:26:12.504
Gosh.

00:26:13.438 --> 00:26:14.706
Is that true?

00:26:15.974 --> 00:26:17.876
Aren't they scouting you?

00:26:19.177 --> 00:26:21.046
No, not really.

00:26:21.379 --> 00:26:23.048
- Really?
- Yes.

00:26:23.548 --> 00:26:25.250
Thank God.

00:26:25.450 --> 00:26:28.486
You were my role model
ever since I joined.

00:26:28.787 --> 00:26:29.854
I look up to you.

00:26:30.455 --> 00:26:33.124
So please let me
keep learning from you up close.

00:26:34.492 --> 00:26:36.227
Kana.

00:26:38.263 --> 00:26:39.564
All right.

00:26:39.731 --> 00:26:41.466
This part here...

00:26:42.467 --> 00:26:44.836
- This first part...
- My heart ached a bit

00:26:45.437 --> 00:26:47.138
once I decided to change jobs.

00:26:47.205 --> 00:26:49.207
This could have more detail.

00:26:49.407 --> 00:26:53.578
Am I a cold person?

00:27:08.860 --> 00:27:09.861
YURIKA

00:27:09.928 --> 00:27:13.898
I'm really sorry.
Any updates on the settlement money?

00:27:20.405 --> 00:27:21.406
Ms. Komoto?

00:27:23.141 --> 00:27:24.142
Good evening.

00:27:24.209 --> 00:27:25.877
Good evening, Mr. Senda.

00:27:26.645 --> 00:27:28.313
Is this seat open?

00:27:28.947 --> 00:27:30.015
Oh, go ahead.

00:27:30.548 --> 00:27:32.350
Excuse me. Thank you.

00:27:34.953 --> 00:27:36.254
You're alone again.

00:27:37.389 --> 00:27:39.858
Well, a lot has happened.

00:27:41.126 --> 00:27:42.193
Did you fight?

00:27:43.528 --> 00:27:48.366
No, it's something
more troublesome and complicated.

00:27:50.335 --> 00:27:51.369
What happened?

00:27:55.840 --> 00:27:56.908
Thank you for waiting.

00:27:59.511 --> 00:28:01.546
No, I'll be fine.

00:28:03.181 --> 00:28:05.016
All right. Cheers.

00:28:09.654 --> 00:28:13.525
Then let's forget
about your complicated troubles

00:28:13.858 --> 00:28:15.160
and have a light conversation.

00:28:15.794 --> 00:28:17.362
- Light conversation?
- Yes.

00:28:20.865 --> 00:28:22.233
What are you eating right now?

00:28:23.201 --> 00:28:25.070
That really is light.

00:28:26.304 --> 00:28:28.339
Boiled dumplings.

00:28:28.506 --> 00:28:30.308
Oh, they have that here?

00:28:30.375 --> 00:28:32.343
Yes, there's a secret menu.

00:28:32.410 --> 00:28:33.945
Oh, I didn't know that.

00:28:34.713 --> 00:28:36.548
You can have one if you'd like.

00:28:36.781 --> 00:28:38.717
- May I?
- Go right ahead.

00:28:39.784 --> 00:28:41.319
Are you okay with celery?

00:28:42.687 --> 00:28:43.688
Yes, I am.

00:28:45.890 --> 00:28:47.392
- Thank you.
- Go ahead.

00:28:52.097 --> 00:28:53.098
That's good!

00:28:53.331 --> 00:28:55.266
What? I've never had
dumplings this good.

00:28:55.333 --> 00:28:56.334
Right?

00:29:07.746 --> 00:29:08.747
What is this?

00:29:10.148 --> 00:29:12.016
I've never had anything like it.

00:29:12.083 --> 00:29:13.251
Right?

00:29:19.424 --> 00:29:20.425
Ms. Komoto?

00:29:22.227 --> 00:29:23.228
Are you okay?

00:29:24.462 --> 00:29:25.463
I'm sorry.

00:29:26.064 --> 00:29:27.799
You're mulling over something again.

00:29:28.767 --> 00:29:30.368
No, not at all.

00:29:30.969 --> 00:29:35.507
I just remembered a memory
I had with my husband.

00:29:37.475 --> 00:29:40.912
Was it a good memory or a bad one?

00:29:42.680 --> 00:29:45.817
At this point,
I'm not sure which it is.

00:29:47.452 --> 00:29:51.022
It's the happiest memory I have
of us being together.

00:29:53.391 --> 00:29:54.559
Let's keep it simple.

00:29:55.226 --> 00:29:57.262
That's a good memory.

00:29:58.229 --> 00:29:59.297
Do you think so?

00:30:01.266 --> 00:30:04.702
Regardless of the present,
it's sad if you reject the past.

00:30:06.337 --> 00:30:09.974
I'm sure it's a good memory
for your husband, too.

00:30:29.194 --> 00:30:30.195
Hey.

00:30:31.896 --> 00:30:32.897
What?

00:30:34.098 --> 00:30:35.767
My glass.

00:30:38.136 --> 00:30:40.438
How many years
have you been a housewife now?

00:30:40.505 --> 00:30:42.006
You should know this.

00:30:55.687 --> 00:30:56.888
- Hey.
- Yes?

00:30:57.922 --> 00:31:00.058
Is Yuna doing okay?

00:31:01.059 --> 00:31:03.928
Can I at least
hear her voice on the phone?

00:31:05.230 --> 00:31:06.431
Please.

00:31:11.002 --> 00:31:12.003
Sure.

00:31:12.170 --> 00:31:13.638
- Really?
- How much will you pay?

00:31:14.873 --> 00:31:16.107
A million yen a minute?

00:31:17.242 --> 00:31:18.243
Oh, you can't.

00:31:18.443 --> 00:31:21.346
You don't work,
so of course you don't have money.

00:31:23.214 --> 00:31:26.117
Or maybe we can ask
your friends to pay extra.

00:31:29.220 --> 00:31:30.221
That's hilarious.

00:31:58.549 --> 00:31:59.550
You're awake.

00:32:01.619 --> 00:32:03.588
Let's keep talking then.

00:32:05.790 --> 00:32:07.492
Were you awake this whole time?

00:32:07.825 --> 00:32:09.394
Yes. Sit here.

00:32:10.728 --> 00:32:11.996
Get some sleep.

00:32:12.764 --> 00:32:13.765
It's fine.

00:32:18.069 --> 00:32:19.070
Coming.

00:32:24.742 --> 00:32:25.743
Who is it?

00:32:28.179 --> 00:32:30.548
Heat rate rising.

00:32:33.952 --> 00:32:35.420
- Hiroki!
- Riko!

00:32:37.956 --> 00:32:38.957
Riko?

00:32:48.099 --> 00:32:50.668
Hiroki, wait!

00:32:50.868 --> 00:32:51.869
Hiroki!

00:32:55.974 --> 00:32:57.275
You...

00:32:57.342 --> 00:32:59.444
- Ryosuke, run!
- Let's go together, Riko!

00:33:02.280 --> 00:33:03.648
Together, you say?

00:33:04.382 --> 00:33:06.551
Did you say "together"?!

00:33:07.151 --> 00:33:08.152
Hiroki!

00:33:08.386 --> 00:33:10.855
Please, stop!

00:33:11.489 --> 00:33:13.591
Heart rate has reached
200 beats per minute.

00:33:17.028 --> 00:33:19.964
This guy's nothing to you,
right, Riko?

00:33:20.498 --> 00:33:22.533
You won't see him again, right?

00:33:23.267 --> 00:33:24.335
Right?!

00:33:27.271 --> 00:33:28.272
Riko?

00:33:29.073 --> 00:33:30.074
Riko!

00:33:30.141 --> 00:33:31.175
Are you okay?

00:33:31.976 --> 00:33:32.977
Riko?

00:33:35.413 --> 00:33:36.414
Riko!

00:33:37.382 --> 00:33:39.584
Hey, Riko!

00:33:48.960 --> 00:33:53.664
Yesterday was fun. Let's have
boiled dumplings again sometime.

00:34:11.115 --> 00:34:13.751
That oden restaurant's name was...

00:34:19.857 --> 00:34:20.858
Maruta.

00:34:29.767 --> 00:34:30.968
Did you check his computer?

00:34:31.869 --> 00:34:32.870
What's his password?

00:34:38.643 --> 00:34:39.644
Thirty million.

00:34:40.645 --> 00:34:41.646
What?

00:34:42.013 --> 00:34:44.615
It's changing from 20 to 30 million.

00:34:45.116 --> 00:34:46.150
Hold on.

00:34:46.217 --> 00:34:49.987
- You can't just--
- It's not enough for the car I want.

00:34:50.621 --> 00:34:51.823
Tell them, okay?

00:34:52.356 --> 00:34:53.858
The deadline's the same.

00:34:54.125 --> 00:34:55.126
Ten days left.

00:34:57.361 --> 00:35:01.365
- Please, reconsider.
- You're in no position to negotiate.

00:35:04.202 --> 00:35:06.003
I was almost killed.

00:35:07.238 --> 00:35:09.540
I'm letting you
settle this with money.

00:35:11.042 --> 00:35:12.310
Be thankful.

00:35:43.674 --> 00:35:44.675
What?

00:36:03.728 --> 00:36:07.231
Why did Mitsuhiro use this word?

00:36:14.505 --> 00:36:16.073
You're pregnant.

00:36:17.108 --> 00:36:18.109
What?

00:36:18.376 --> 00:36:19.544
It's been two months.

00:36:20.545 --> 00:36:22.013
You're two months pregnant.

00:37:57.541 --> 00:37:59.410
Good evening, viewers.

00:37:59.810 --> 00:38:00.845
This is Yurika.

00:38:01.579 --> 00:38:06.584
Thank you for always supporting us
at such a late hour.

00:38:07.585 --> 00:38:11.155
We're only able to be here
because of viewers like you.

00:38:11.789 --> 00:38:13.958
Please tune in next week...

00:38:15.326 --> 00:38:17.561
What? You're not watching?

00:38:18.095 --> 00:38:21.766
If you don't watch,
I'm going to retrain you.

00:38:22.066 --> 00:38:24.669
Next week on Please Die My Beloved.

00:38:25.303 --> 00:38:26.671
"Friendship Breakdown."

00:38:26.771 --> 00:38:28.906
I won't let you get
a fresh start on your own!

00:38:28.973 --> 00:38:31.342
Let's kill them. It'll be fine.

00:38:31.409 --> 00:38:32.710
- After all, we've...
- Stop.

00:38:32.777 --> 00:38:34.345
My glass.

00:38:34.478 --> 00:38:36.347
You have to pour for me.

00:38:36.480 --> 00:38:38.049
Hurry up.

00:38:38.182 --> 00:38:40.584
- Yurika, your personality changed.
- Yurika, your personality changed.

00:38:40.651 --> 00:38:41.652
And I'm singing.
