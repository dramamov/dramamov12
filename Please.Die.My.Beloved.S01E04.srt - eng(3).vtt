WEBVTT

00:00:03.069 --> 00:00:04.070
The life I led...

00:00:04.704 --> 00:00:08.341
Was it bad enough
to warrant lies when I speak?

00:00:09.009 --> 00:00:10.043
Ms. Komoto

00:00:10.610 --> 00:00:11.945
did you lie?

00:00:12.479 --> 00:00:13.480
What?

00:00:14.147 --> 00:00:16.916
You didn't lie
about your private life?

00:00:18.885 --> 00:00:20.820
I didn't think about that.

00:00:22.522 --> 00:00:25.925
I can't let my company know
that my husband went missing.

00:00:26.993 --> 00:00:28.061
Maya.

00:00:30.530 --> 00:00:31.965
The police just called.

00:00:32.699 --> 00:00:33.800
The police?

00:00:37.470 --> 00:00:38.571
Why to the office?

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:41.207
If only you'd just die!

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:44.644
It might be an impersonation.

00:00:45.211 --> 00:00:46.279
An impersonation?

00:00:48.815 --> 00:00:51.584
Well...

00:00:51.651 --> 00:00:52.652
What's wrong?

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:54.521
Chief.

00:00:56.589 --> 00:00:57.791
Actually...

00:01:04.164 --> 00:01:08.535
If you mix in a hint of truth,
it's harder to catch the lie.

00:01:18.311 --> 00:01:19.446
I'm starving.

00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:22.849
The French restaurant upstairs
is nice.

00:01:22.916 --> 00:01:24.818
Oh, really? I can't wait.

00:01:35.428 --> 00:01:36.629
Going down.

00:01:38.298 --> 00:01:39.732
Doors closing.

00:01:54.481 --> 00:01:56.916
Daddy, are you okay?

00:04:17.056 --> 00:04:19.492
PLEASE DIE MY BELOVED

00:04:34.173 --> 00:04:35.241
Riko!

00:04:38.378 --> 00:04:39.379
Hiroki.

00:04:41.147 --> 00:04:42.882
I was nearby, so I came to get you.

00:04:45.551 --> 00:04:46.586
What's wrong?

00:04:48.621 --> 00:04:49.722
Sorry.

00:04:50.957 --> 00:04:52.125
You caught me off guard.

00:04:53.293 --> 00:04:54.294
Surprise!

00:04:55.194 --> 00:04:56.396
I see.

00:04:57.397 --> 00:05:01.634
Then, since you're here,
how about dinner first?

00:05:01.701 --> 00:05:03.403
Oh, nice. Let's go.

00:05:03.469 --> 00:05:06.472
I heard the French restaurant
upstairs is great.

00:05:06.973 --> 00:05:08.741
Nice idea.

00:05:08.808 --> 00:05:12.378
Were you scouting the place out?
Is that why you rode the elevator?

00:05:14.180 --> 00:05:17.950
Yeah, I heard the restaurants
in this hotel are nice.

00:05:18.017 --> 00:05:19.419
I see.

00:05:20.086 --> 00:05:21.688
Then let's go.

00:05:33.800 --> 00:05:34.801
Yes.

00:05:36.569 --> 00:05:40.573
Yes, just in case,
we'll take a look on-site as well.

00:05:41.574 --> 00:05:43.976
Yes, have a good day.

00:05:47.080 --> 00:05:48.648
How did it go?

00:05:50.049 --> 00:05:52.018
I managed to convince them.

00:05:52.819 --> 00:05:55.655
So the event is still on, right?

00:05:57.023 --> 00:05:59.892
Thank God.

00:06:01.327 --> 00:06:02.729
And I'm sorry.

00:06:03.463 --> 00:06:07.166
This was the section chief's job,
but he's not here.

00:06:07.934 --> 00:06:10.136
You scared me.

00:06:10.903 --> 00:06:11.971
The police?

00:06:15.108 --> 00:06:16.342
Why to the office?

00:06:16.943 --> 00:06:19.679
Well...

00:06:19.746 --> 00:06:20.847
What's wrong?

00:06:21.714 --> 00:06:22.782
Chief.

00:06:23.816 --> 00:06:24.884
Actually...

00:06:26.786 --> 00:06:28.921
The event at the Nakano branch

00:06:28.988 --> 00:06:32.191
has been getting noise complaints
from the locals.

00:06:33.259 --> 00:06:34.694
Noise?

00:06:34.761 --> 00:06:37.330
Did the event involve anything loud?

00:06:39.532 --> 00:06:40.900
No.

00:06:40.967 --> 00:06:43.236
I don't think so.

00:06:43.302 --> 00:06:44.303
I see.

00:06:45.071 --> 00:06:48.207
It might just be the usual heckler

00:06:48.274 --> 00:06:50.610
but we might be at fault too.

00:06:50.676 --> 00:06:52.078
Proceed cautiously, okay?

00:06:52.812 --> 00:06:54.013
- Yes, ma'am.
- Yes, ma'am.

00:06:58.951 --> 00:06:59.986
Maya?

00:07:00.920 --> 00:07:02.255
Please take over.

00:07:05.925 --> 00:07:09.228
My heart was racing
since you said it was the police.

00:07:10.830 --> 00:07:13.966
Oh? Did you do something shady, Maya?

00:07:14.801 --> 00:07:15.802
What?

00:07:16.903 --> 00:07:19.172
No, it's not like that.

00:07:28.014 --> 00:07:29.015
Oh.

00:07:29.849 --> 00:07:31.884
I'll check on-site, just in case.

00:07:33.085 --> 00:07:34.887
- Thank you.
- Yes.

00:07:35.655 --> 00:07:36.823
I'm heading out.

00:08:03.916 --> 00:08:05.084
Good morning.

00:08:09.088 --> 00:08:10.122
Good morning.

00:08:10.189 --> 00:08:11.891
You're up early.

00:08:11.958 --> 00:08:13.125
Yeah.

00:08:13.192 --> 00:08:16.829
I wanted to finish the wash
before I head out.

00:08:17.330 --> 00:08:18.531
Wow.

00:08:19.332 --> 00:08:20.333
And now...

00:08:21.501 --> 00:08:23.970
here's the finishing touch.

00:08:25.771 --> 00:08:27.707
This is so cute!

00:08:27.773 --> 00:08:28.875
I need a photo.

00:08:30.943 --> 00:08:32.311
Good morning.

00:08:32.378 --> 00:08:34.013
Good morning, Yuna.

00:08:34.080 --> 00:08:37.183
Hey, Daddy made a cute lunch for you.

00:09:00.640 --> 00:09:01.674
Good morning.

00:09:04.043 --> 00:09:05.077
Good morning.

00:09:07.613 --> 00:09:09.382
Why are you up so early?

00:09:12.251 --> 00:09:13.252
Here.

00:09:13.319 --> 00:09:15.121
25 WAYS TO MAKE RIKO HAPPY

00:09:15.187 --> 00:09:16.489
What is it?

00:09:16.556 --> 00:09:18.457
Date spots for us.

00:09:19.058 --> 00:09:21.961
You know, since you found
that nice restaurant yesterday.

00:09:23.529 --> 00:09:24.664
You found this many?

00:09:25.464 --> 00:09:27.366
I was having fun looking things up.

00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:30.102
Before I knew it, the sun was up.

00:09:34.473 --> 00:09:35.608
Let's see them all.

00:09:36.876 --> 00:09:37.910
I'm excited.

00:09:41.147 --> 00:09:42.181
Aren't you excited?

00:09:44.850 --> 00:09:45.885
I'm excited.

00:09:47.620 --> 00:09:48.621
Let's see them all.

00:10:15.681 --> 00:10:21.387
Maya, Riko, Yurika
Want to go drinking tonight?

00:10:22.922 --> 00:10:23.990
What?

00:10:28.027 --> 00:10:29.328
Are you alone today?

00:10:29.829 --> 00:10:30.863
What?

00:10:30.930 --> 00:10:32.798
You had two friends the other day.

00:10:35.067 --> 00:10:36.936
Is your workplace nearby?

00:10:37.970 --> 00:10:39.071
Oh, yes.

00:10:40.406 --> 00:10:42.174
You're...

00:10:42.975 --> 00:10:45.811
I'm Senda.
Sorry I didn't tell you before.

00:10:45.878 --> 00:10:47.279
Oh, not at all.

00:10:47.780 --> 00:10:49.315
- Mr. Senda.
- Yes.

00:10:49.949 --> 00:10:51.784
- I'm Komoto.
- Ms. Komoto.

00:10:52.718 --> 00:10:54.420
Do you work nearby too?

00:10:55.021 --> 00:10:56.155
Yes.

00:10:59.659 --> 00:11:02.328
It feels odd
meeting outside like this.

00:11:02.895 --> 00:11:04.697
That's... That's true.

00:11:08.701 --> 00:11:09.902
He's missing?

00:11:11.570 --> 00:11:13.339
I have no idea where he is.

00:11:15.241 --> 00:11:18.210
So that's what you were
trying to figure out.

00:11:18.878 --> 00:11:19.979
Yes.

00:11:20.813 --> 00:11:22.682
The situation
is pretty shocking, right?

00:11:22.748 --> 00:11:23.949
I'm sorry.

00:11:24.850 --> 00:11:28.521
But keeping it to myself
was hard on me

00:11:28.587 --> 00:11:30.189
so I wanted to tell someone.

00:11:31.157 --> 00:11:33.059
It's hard to keep secrets, right?

00:11:33.125 --> 00:11:34.260
Exactly.

00:11:36.228 --> 00:11:37.430
By the way

00:11:37.496 --> 00:11:40.433
what kind of person was your husband?

00:11:42.835 --> 00:11:44.503
A science nerd.

00:11:44.570 --> 00:11:45.705
That's surprising.

00:11:46.572 --> 00:11:49.308
He's the complete opposite
of my usual type

00:11:49.375 --> 00:11:51.010
and we're totally different.

00:11:51.544 --> 00:11:55.848
But it felt refreshing
when we were still dating.

00:11:57.149 --> 00:11:58.317
Like what, for example?

00:12:01.120 --> 00:12:03.823
Like how logical he was
when he spoke.

00:12:05.024 --> 00:12:06.592
Or his quiet demeanor.

00:12:07.259 --> 00:12:08.861
Or how he likes solitude.

00:12:12.465 --> 00:12:16.502
But after we married
and started living together

00:12:17.236 --> 00:12:19.672
they all became things I hate.

00:12:20.873 --> 00:12:21.874
What?

00:12:23.109 --> 00:12:26.712
His logical way of speaking
is just superficial.

00:12:27.346 --> 00:12:29.215
His quiet demeanor

00:12:29.949 --> 00:12:31.083
is just laziness.

00:12:31.584 --> 00:12:34.754
His solitude was only because
he has no friends.

00:12:35.921 --> 00:12:36.922
I see.

00:12:39.091 --> 00:12:40.092
But...

00:12:41.327 --> 00:12:44.430
he never struck me
as someone who would have an affair.

00:12:47.800 --> 00:12:51.337
Good grief, every last man is just...

00:12:54.006 --> 00:12:55.341
Oh, I'm sorry.

00:12:55.841 --> 00:12:56.876
No, it's fine.

00:12:59.345 --> 00:13:02.615
But those words
sound like they come from experience.

00:13:05.584 --> 00:13:09.922
Were you hurt by another man before?

00:13:34.180 --> 00:13:35.181
Ms. Komoto?

00:13:37.016 --> 00:13:38.017
What?

00:13:40.085 --> 00:13:43.055
Sorry, it was rude of me to ask.

00:13:43.556 --> 00:13:45.224
No, not at all.

00:13:45.925 --> 00:13:47.593
Oh, what do you want to drink?

00:13:48.093 --> 00:13:49.695
How about another glass?

00:13:49.762 --> 00:13:51.096
Of course.

00:13:52.097 --> 00:13:55.067
Okay, for a change of pace

00:13:55.134 --> 00:13:56.435
a coke highball.

00:13:57.436 --> 00:13:58.537
A coke highball.

00:14:05.144 --> 00:14:10.916
Ryosuke, See you next Monday then

00:14:12.952 --> 00:14:18.023
Riko, Okay, can't wait to see you

00:14:18.090 --> 00:14:22.895
Me too. I love you

00:14:22.962 --> 00:14:24.129
I'm home.

00:14:25.397 --> 00:14:28.801
Riko?

00:14:33.138 --> 00:14:34.139
There you are.

00:14:35.074 --> 00:14:36.075
Welcome home.

00:14:38.811 --> 00:14:40.045
What were you doing?

00:14:40.112 --> 00:14:43.582
I was thinking
about what to wear for our next date.

00:14:47.486 --> 00:14:48.587
Riko...

00:15:02.234 --> 00:15:03.235
Okay.

00:15:04.069 --> 00:15:06.805
Then I'll help you choose.

00:15:08.674 --> 00:15:09.675
It's fine

00:15:10.576 --> 00:15:11.911
Let's choose next time.

00:15:12.811 --> 00:15:13.846
- I see.
- Yeah.

00:15:14.813 --> 00:15:15.814
In that case

00:15:16.315 --> 00:15:17.816
maybe I'll cook dinner.

00:15:19.952 --> 00:15:20.986
Thank you.

00:15:21.620 --> 00:15:23.289
All right.

00:15:23.355 --> 00:15:24.556
Time to cook.

00:15:36.235 --> 00:15:37.736
All right, here goes.

00:15:37.803 --> 00:15:39.672
There! Good job!

00:15:42.708 --> 00:15:44.209
You're good at this! Here.

00:15:44.843 --> 00:15:46.845
Phew. Wow.

00:15:49.748 --> 00:15:51.183
All right, let's stop here.

00:15:51.717 --> 00:15:53.485
Okay? Let's go to bed.

00:15:53.552 --> 00:15:55.921
Let's lie down now.

00:15:57.056 --> 00:15:58.991
Phew. There.

00:15:59.058 --> 00:16:01.727
You were always asking
to sleep with Daddy.

00:16:01.794 --> 00:16:02.828
What changed?

00:16:04.630 --> 00:16:05.631
Mommy.

00:16:06.231 --> 00:16:07.333
Yes?

00:16:11.971 --> 00:16:14.306
Daddy, are you okay?

00:16:22.181 --> 00:16:25.284
Hey, Daddy made you a cute lunch.

00:16:32.324 --> 00:16:34.960
Nothing. Good night.

00:16:37.663 --> 00:16:38.998
Good night.

00:16:54.279 --> 00:16:55.948
- She's asleep?
- Yeah.

00:16:56.648 --> 00:16:58.350
Her sleeping face is so cute.

00:16:58.417 --> 00:16:59.651
Go take a look.

00:16:59.718 --> 00:17:01.720
Oh, I'll go look later.

00:17:03.222 --> 00:17:04.623
Oh, right.

00:17:04.690 --> 00:17:05.691
Hmm?

00:17:09.328 --> 00:17:10.629
Here.

00:17:10.696 --> 00:17:12.297
What is this?

00:17:14.233 --> 00:17:15.601
A present.

00:17:16.468 --> 00:17:18.504
A thank-you for all your hard work.

00:17:20.039 --> 00:17:22.107
You've never done this before!

00:17:22.174 --> 00:17:23.742
Oh, really?

00:17:23.809 --> 00:17:25.244
No, I'm kidding.

00:17:30.682 --> 00:17:32.251
I'm so happy!

00:17:33.419 --> 00:17:34.887
Take it out for a spin.

00:17:37.289 --> 00:17:38.657
Go hit the town

00:17:39.224 --> 00:17:40.492
with your usual trio.

00:17:40.993 --> 00:17:41.994
Are you sure?

00:17:42.494 --> 00:17:43.862
Of course.

00:18:20.666 --> 00:18:21.700
Yasuaki.

00:18:47.926 --> 00:18:50.028
What brings you here all of a sudden?

00:18:55.501 --> 00:18:57.169
Are you going outside lately?

00:19:00.706 --> 00:19:02.374
Is Mitsuhiro still not back?

00:19:08.580 --> 00:19:09.615
How did you know?

00:19:10.115 --> 00:19:11.550
You told the police, right?

00:19:12.584 --> 00:19:14.052
- What?
- Did you find anything?

00:19:16.388 --> 00:19:19.158
- Well--
- No leads at all, huh?

00:19:21.793 --> 00:19:22.794
What the heck?

00:19:23.962 --> 00:19:26.064
You came all this way
just to say that?

00:19:26.131 --> 00:19:27.132
Can't I?

00:19:27.199 --> 00:19:28.367
No, I'm just saying...

00:19:29.601 --> 00:19:31.904
You've never cared
about my private life.

00:19:36.775 --> 00:19:38.810
Hey, wait.

00:19:40.546 --> 00:19:41.847
Did you check his computer?

00:19:42.748 --> 00:19:43.749
What?

00:19:47.653 --> 00:19:48.820
What's his password?

00:19:49.388 --> 00:19:50.822
How would I know?

00:19:53.525 --> 00:19:54.626
I see.

00:19:57.462 --> 00:19:58.764
Okay, I see.

00:19:58.830 --> 00:20:00.032
I see.

00:20:01.967 --> 00:20:04.236
What? Hey, hold on.

00:20:04.303 --> 00:20:05.504
What is all this?

00:20:06.004 --> 00:20:07.072
Yasuaki!

00:20:22.654 --> 00:20:23.655
That was twice.

00:20:25.123 --> 00:20:26.124
What?

00:20:27.593 --> 00:20:30.896
I haven't heard you
call my name in a while.

00:20:35.834 --> 00:20:37.569
Mitsuhiro will be back soon.

00:21:05.130 --> 00:21:06.231
Does Yasuaki...

00:21:09.835 --> 00:21:11.703
know something...

00:21:14.773 --> 00:21:16.141
that I don't?

00:21:41.933 --> 00:21:44.236
YUTO TAKAGI
MY APOLOGIES FOR THE SUDDEN EMAIL

00:21:49.474 --> 00:21:50.475
Komoto.

00:21:51.009 --> 00:21:52.844
- Do you have a moment?
- Yes.

00:21:52.911 --> 00:21:54.579
- You too, Torii.
- Okay.

00:22:04.256 --> 00:22:06.858
LIFESTYLE SALES
USING FRAGRANCES AS BRANDING

00:22:09.127 --> 00:22:10.462
Really?

00:22:11.396 --> 00:22:14.700
The chief said we could
test it out at one of the branches.

00:22:14.766 --> 00:22:17.803
Really? I thought
it wouldn't go through.

00:22:18.804 --> 00:22:21.740
It'll be hard, negotiating with
the tenants and all.

00:22:22.240 --> 00:22:23.709
But good luck, Komoto.

00:22:24.209 --> 00:22:25.310
Okay.

00:22:25.377 --> 00:22:26.378
You too, Torii.

00:22:26.978 --> 00:22:30.048
This stuff works best
in a female tag team.

00:22:34.052 --> 00:22:35.387
- Okay.
- Do your best.

00:22:35.454 --> 00:22:37.356
Yes, thank you.

00:22:37.422 --> 00:22:38.890
Thank you.

00:22:42.627 --> 00:22:45.230
- Excuse us.
- Excuse us.

00:22:47.332 --> 00:22:48.433
Maya.

00:22:48.934 --> 00:22:50.635
I'll work on the zoning plan

00:22:50.702 --> 00:22:53.472
and plan out the fragrances
for each area.

00:22:53.538 --> 00:22:56.908
I'll be relying on
your fragrance expertise.

00:22:56.975 --> 00:22:58.310
I'll do my best.

00:23:02.681 --> 00:23:06.251
YUTO TAKAGI
MY APOLOGIES FOR THE SUDDEN EMAIL

00:23:12.491 --> 00:23:13.525
What?

00:23:16.728 --> 00:23:18.296
Please raise your glasses.

00:23:18.363 --> 00:23:19.464
- Okay.
- Okay.

00:23:20.499 --> 00:23:21.533
Ready?

00:23:21.600 --> 00:23:23.034
- We survived another day!
- We survived another day!

00:23:23.101 --> 00:23:24.403
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

00:23:26.371 --> 00:23:28.440
What? You were scouted?

00:23:28.507 --> 00:23:29.508
Shh!

00:23:29.574 --> 00:23:35.414
Sorry, but Katsuta Holdings
is the biggest firm in the industry.

00:23:35.914 --> 00:23:37.816
If they headhunt you

00:23:38.383 --> 00:23:39.418
that's amazing.

00:23:39.484 --> 00:23:41.353
I was shocked.

00:23:41.420 --> 00:23:44.589
I thought it was a prank at first.

00:23:45.724 --> 00:23:48.293
YUTO TAKAGI
GLOBAL HIGH ASSOCIATES

00:23:48.894 --> 00:23:49.895
What?

00:24:19.858 --> 00:24:21.259
My name is Yuto Takagi.

00:24:21.326 --> 00:24:22.727
I'm Maya Komoto.

00:24:22.794 --> 00:24:24.629
- Nice to meet you.
- As am I.

00:24:24.696 --> 00:24:26.798
- Please.
- Thank you.

00:24:27.466 --> 00:24:30.368
KATSUTA HOLDINGS COMPANY PROFILE

00:24:36.107 --> 00:24:38.577
They're making
a new department next fiscal term.

00:24:39.511 --> 00:24:42.314
They want you to be a subleader.

00:24:42.814 --> 00:24:43.949
A subleader?

00:24:44.983 --> 00:24:46.551
- Really?
- Yes.

00:24:47.052 --> 00:24:51.089
If you're interested,
I'll introduce you to them.

00:24:52.090 --> 00:24:53.091
Well...

00:24:53.925 --> 00:24:55.060
Why me?

00:24:55.660 --> 00:24:59.130
While I was looking into people
who matched their conditions

00:24:59.731 --> 00:25:01.700
I found your interview article.

00:25:04.169 --> 00:25:05.237
That article?

00:25:05.303 --> 00:25:06.938
You seemed perfect.

00:25:07.539 --> 00:25:10.509
You have your achievements,
attitude toward work

00:25:11.009 --> 00:25:12.777
and your supporting husband.

00:25:16.781 --> 00:25:18.016
Thank you.

00:25:23.855 --> 00:25:25.090
Congratulations.

00:25:25.156 --> 00:25:28.293
I haven't decided yet.
They gave me a week to consider it.

00:25:28.360 --> 00:25:31.396
Why are you hesitating?
The pay's higher, right?

00:25:31.463 --> 00:25:33.532
Yeah, but...

00:25:33.598 --> 00:25:35.600
There's also more pressure.

00:25:35.667 --> 00:25:37.869
You'll be just fine.

00:25:37.936 --> 00:25:39.604
Come on, let's toast.

00:25:39.671 --> 00:25:40.739
We just did.

00:25:40.805 --> 00:25:42.807
- Another one, to celebrate.
- Hey.

00:25:43.942 --> 00:25:45.410
Is it that big of a deal?

00:25:45.477 --> 00:25:47.145
Yeah, it's huge.

00:25:48.613 --> 00:25:49.714
I don't see it.

00:25:50.248 --> 00:25:51.716
Right? Sorry.

00:25:53.385 --> 00:25:54.553
Oh, right.

00:25:54.619 --> 00:25:56.254
Ta-da, look at this!

00:25:56.321 --> 00:25:57.789
So cute!

00:25:57.856 --> 00:25:58.857
I love it.

00:25:58.924 --> 00:26:01.226
It's a present from Tetsuya.

00:26:01.293 --> 00:26:03.528
What? That's incredible.

00:26:03.595 --> 00:26:06.131
My husband has never bought me
anything like that.

00:26:06.932 --> 00:26:10.869
You're amazing for raising
such a great husband.

00:26:10.936 --> 00:26:13.171
What? You think so?

00:26:13.705 --> 00:26:16.675
But he's kind, thoughtful

00:26:16.741 --> 00:26:18.643
and even does the housework
and babysitting.

00:26:19.311 --> 00:26:21.413
He's becoming just what I wanted.

00:26:23.648 --> 00:26:27.419
Even after I really
wished for him to die back then.

00:26:36.461 --> 00:26:37.929
Is this me?

00:26:37.996 --> 00:26:39.264
Yeah.

00:26:40.865 --> 00:26:42.000
This is Mommy.

00:26:43.101 --> 00:26:44.336
This is Maya.

00:26:45.070 --> 00:26:46.838
She was holding your legs.

00:26:52.010 --> 00:26:53.311
This is Riko.

00:26:54.613 --> 00:26:57.449
She was wrapping you in tape.

00:27:02.387 --> 00:27:03.488
Wow.

00:27:06.157 --> 00:27:07.993
You're good at drawing, Yuna.

00:27:16.935 --> 00:27:18.770
So then, Tetsuya

00:27:19.604 --> 00:27:20.805
the other day

00:27:20.872 --> 00:27:22.540
asked what Reiwa was.

00:27:22.607 --> 00:27:23.875
What?

00:27:26.011 --> 00:27:27.512
I couldn't believe him.

00:27:29.648 --> 00:27:31.549
And what about you, Riko?

00:27:32.183 --> 00:27:34.686
Well, it's the same as always.

00:27:35.186 --> 00:27:38.456
But he's been happier
after our dinner date

00:27:39.124 --> 00:27:40.992
so he's watching me less.

00:27:41.660 --> 00:27:43.662
He doesn't know about the affair?

00:27:43.728 --> 00:27:45.030
Not at all.

00:27:45.096 --> 00:27:48.166
He'd never believe
that I'd cheat on him.

00:27:48.667 --> 00:27:50.335
He doesn't want to imagine it.

00:27:50.835 --> 00:27:53.171
It's kind of admirable of him.

00:27:53.238 --> 00:27:55.006
You heard his screaming, right?

00:27:55.807 --> 00:27:57.342
He's gone off the rails.

00:27:57.409 --> 00:28:03.181
Riko!

00:28:07.318 --> 00:28:09.320
That's true.

00:28:09.387 --> 00:28:11.723
You might not like your husband

00:28:11.790 --> 00:28:13.858
but you can't keep cheating on him.

00:28:16.594 --> 00:28:19.064
I think I need to get
a lawyer when I get the chance

00:28:19.130 --> 00:28:21.499
and bring up divorce to him.

00:28:28.940 --> 00:28:31.276
What should I pick out for her?

00:28:37.415 --> 00:28:38.483
This one.

00:29:14.886 --> 00:29:15.887
What's this?

00:29:18.056 --> 00:29:21.526
Anyway, this means things are
going well for the three of us.

00:29:23.094 --> 00:29:26.598
Well, Maya might be feeling uneasy
about Mitsuhiro though.

00:29:27.165 --> 00:29:30.268
I feel more at ease
than when he was around.

00:29:31.836 --> 00:29:32.837
In that case...

00:29:33.638 --> 00:29:35.607
To our bright future!

00:29:36.941 --> 00:29:38.143
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

00:30:00.231 --> 00:30:02.200
I'm happy about getting headhunted.

00:30:04.836 --> 00:30:07.639
Normally, I wouldn't hesitate.

00:30:09.407 --> 00:30:10.408
But...

00:30:11.676 --> 00:30:13.344
You seemed perfect.

00:30:13.945 --> 00:30:16.881
You have your achievements,
attitude toward work

00:30:17.382 --> 00:30:19.217
and your supporting husband.

00:30:20.919 --> 00:30:22.954
You didn't lie
about your private life?

00:30:30.795 --> 00:30:33.464
A WOMAN'S VOICE IN URBAN PLANNING
SPOUSES THAT BUILD EACH OTHER UP

00:30:33.531 --> 00:30:37.435
We try not to talk about
work while we're at home.

00:30:37.502 --> 00:30:41.840
When things are busy for me,
he helps out by doing housework.

00:30:41.906 --> 00:30:44.309
And he helps inspire new ideas...

00:30:44.375 --> 00:30:47.178
MY HUSBAND AND I BUILD EACH OTHER UP

00:30:51.816 --> 00:30:56.821
Should I really move on without
finding out what happened to him?

00:31:07.365 --> 00:31:08.433
Hey, wait.

00:31:10.468 --> 00:31:11.769
Did you check his computer?

00:31:12.737 --> 00:31:13.771
What's his password?

00:31:28.453 --> 00:31:30.588
MITSUHIRO

00:31:33.024 --> 00:31:34.726
His birthday.

00:31:40.131 --> 00:31:41.132
INCORRECT PASSWORD

00:31:51.042 --> 00:31:52.443
Our wedding anniversary.

00:31:55.213 --> 00:31:56.214
INCORRECT PASSWORD

00:32:08.526 --> 00:32:11.162
TOKYO POLICE, SHIMURA

00:32:12.830 --> 00:32:13.932
I'm home.

00:32:44.896 --> 00:32:46.030
Welcome home.

00:32:48.566 --> 00:32:49.701
What is this?

00:32:50.368 --> 00:32:51.636
That's my question.

00:32:52.437 --> 00:32:53.438
What is this?

00:32:54.706 --> 00:32:56.307
I didn't know you had two phones.

00:33:02.280 --> 00:33:03.548
That's...

00:33:05.183 --> 00:33:06.851
The one I used before.

00:33:08.653 --> 00:33:11.489
- My old smartphone.
- No, I've never seen this one.

00:33:12.557 --> 00:33:14.492
The last one had a scratch here

00:33:14.559 --> 00:33:17.662
and the one before that
only had one camera lens.

00:33:20.531 --> 00:33:22.633
Oh, no, I was mistaken.

00:33:23.601 --> 00:33:25.436
Oh, right. It's for work.

00:33:31.275 --> 00:33:32.310
What is this?

00:33:32.377 --> 00:33:34.612
Heart rate rising.

00:33:36.447 --> 00:33:37.782
What is this?

00:33:37.849 --> 00:33:41.319
Ryosuke
I miss you. I can't wait to see you

00:33:41.386 --> 00:33:44.689
Heart rate has reached
180 beats per second.

00:33:44.756 --> 00:33:48.159
Heart rate has reached
180 beats per second.

00:33:48.226 --> 00:33:49.260
Hey, Riko.

00:33:51.229 --> 00:33:52.397
Riko.

00:33:52.463 --> 00:33:54.198
Riko...

00:33:54.265 --> 00:33:55.867
Riko...

00:33:55.933 --> 00:33:58.336
Riko!

00:33:58.403 --> 00:34:02.106
Riko!

00:34:11.516 --> 00:34:13.317
I'm home!

00:34:23.261 --> 00:34:25.496
That was so much fun.

00:34:26.798 --> 00:34:29.967
Hey, I got so many compliments
about this bag.

00:34:31.235 --> 00:34:32.236
Really?

00:34:33.371 --> 00:34:34.739
I'm glad.

00:34:35.706 --> 00:34:38.543
I just feel so happy nowadays.

00:34:39.043 --> 00:34:40.411
Is this a dream?

00:34:53.524 --> 00:34:54.959
Hey, wait.

00:34:55.026 --> 00:34:56.627
What are you doing?

00:34:56.694 --> 00:34:58.729
Stop! What is going on here?

00:35:04.502 --> 00:35:07.405
What do you think this is?

00:35:16.114 --> 00:35:18.716
What? You think so?

00:35:18.783 --> 00:35:21.719
But he's kind, thoughtful

00:35:21.786 --> 00:35:24.222
and even does the housework
and babysitting.

00:35:24.288 --> 00:35:26.624
He's becoming just what I wanted.

00:35:28.726 --> 00:35:32.430
Even after I really
wished for him to die back then.

00:35:44.876 --> 00:35:48.679
TOKYO POLICE, SHIMURA

00:35:52.350 --> 00:35:53.518
Hello?

00:35:53.584 --> 00:35:54.652
This is Komoto.

00:35:56.053 --> 00:35:57.622
Sorry to call at this hour.

00:35:58.289 --> 00:35:59.690
Did you find something?

00:35:59.757 --> 00:36:03.961
Actually, your husband might have
been involved in an incident.

00:38:08.152 --> 00:38:10.788
Why didn't you get pollack roe
with my drink?

00:38:12.089 --> 00:38:13.324
I'm Tetsuya.

00:38:13.924 --> 00:38:16.027
My memory's back, you idiots.

00:38:16.093 --> 00:38:18.329
They played me for a fool.

00:38:19.230 --> 00:38:21.866
It's time for my abusive revenge.

00:38:21.932 --> 00:38:23.234
Look forward to it.

00:38:23.301 --> 00:38:25.503
Why don't you understand?

00:38:25.569 --> 00:38:27.305
Come up with some ideas.

00:38:27.938 --> 00:38:30.308
She's oddly calm
given the circumstances.

00:38:30.374 --> 00:38:33.711
My husband was in the wrong
for leaving after having an affair.

00:38:33.778 --> 00:38:36.647
Next week on Please Die My Beloved.

00:38:37.148 --> 00:38:38.482
Memories Come Back.

00:38:38.983 --> 00:38:41.185
You'd better tune in,
or I'll abuse you too.
