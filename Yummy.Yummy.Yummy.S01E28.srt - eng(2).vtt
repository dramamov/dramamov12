=Episode 28=

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:45.940
(Princess Fuhui's Mansion)

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:46.960
Lady Shen,

00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:48.880
the biluo you made

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:50.710
is quite interesting.

00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:52.730
Biluo originated
from the Western Regions

00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:55.010
and became very popular
after it was introduced here.

00:01:55.090 --> 00:01:56.160
My family and I

00:01:56.160 --> 00:01:57.570
have developed several new flavors.

00:01:57.680 --> 00:01:59.350
Using milk, eggs, and butter,

00:01:59.350 --> 00:02:00.520
we whip it into cream.

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:02.120
So, the ordinary cherry biluo

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:03.630
has become a cream cherry biluo.

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:06.120
This one that tastes like crab meat

00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:07.760
is actually made from fish paste.

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:08.830
It's molded into shape

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:10.150
to make a crab stick.

00:02:14.710 --> 00:02:16.150
From the Western Regions

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:17.550
to the Central Plains.

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:19.990
We should let them see

00:02:19.990 --> 00:02:21.920
that after coming here,

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:24.480
the flavor has become more unique.

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:27.310
Actually, the idea of improving biluo

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:28.430
was suggested by my father.

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:30.520
He said that a thousand years later,

00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:31.640
people's hearts will change,

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:33.960
and perhaps their tastes will change.

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:35.200
People might

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:36.830
forget this delicacy, biluo.

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:38.800
But if we keep innovating,

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:40.030
maybe this dish

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:41.360
can be passed down.

00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:42.800
Innovate?

00:02:43.710 --> 00:02:45.030
Create something new?

00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:47.830
What an interesting word.

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:50.100
It seems that the reason your father

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:52.600
can make Shen's Diner so successful

00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:55.270
is not only because he creates
new dishes

00:02:55.750 --> 00:02:57.960
but also because his ideas are unique.

00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:03.750
How can we eat biluo without tea?

00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:09.400
Today, I wanted to drink your tea,

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:10.240
so I had them

00:03:10.240 --> 00:03:11.800
buy it for me.

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:16.200
Your Highness, let me.

00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:17.040
No need.

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:19.200
Today, I'll do it myself.

00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:20.590
Alright.

00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:49.200
(Pei Fei)
Today,

00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:50.150
I ordered

00:03:50.150 --> 00:03:52.240
your Slap-the-Heartbreaker Drink.

00:03:56.870 --> 00:03:57.710
You always ignore me

00:03:57.710 --> 00:03:58.890
and refuse my invitations.

00:03:58.890 --> 00:03:59.800
You always ignore me

00:03:59.800 --> 00:04:00.900
and refuse my invitations.

00:04:05.780 --> 00:04:06.940
(Pei Fei)

00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:09.340
(Pei Fei)

00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:22.120
Mr. Lin was impeached

00:04:22.480 --> 00:04:24.070
for overstepping his authority.

00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:26.190
He's been suspended by my brother.

00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:27.640
What?

00:04:31.100 --> 00:04:34.100
(Upright in Speech and Conduct)

00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:44.520
Young Master.

00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:45.660
Young Master,

00:04:45.660 --> 00:04:46.720
Mr. Meng is here.

00:04:49.190 --> 00:04:50.030
Mr. Meng.

00:04:52.240 --> 00:04:53.680
I've come to see

00:04:53.990 --> 00:04:55.240
how you are.

00:04:57.870 --> 00:04:59.430
Still calm.

00:04:59.870 --> 00:05:00.750
Don't worry.

00:05:00.750 --> 00:05:02.390
I came from the backyard.

00:05:02.820 --> 00:05:03.800
No one saw me.

00:05:11.160 --> 00:05:12.600
Anran, do you know,

00:05:12.870 --> 00:05:14.120
throughout history,

00:05:14.680 --> 00:05:16.720
what happened to those

00:05:17.070 --> 00:05:18.750
who were demoted
and fell into the abyss?

00:05:19.040 --> 00:05:19.950
Out of ten,

00:05:20.480 --> 00:05:21.460
hardly one or two

00:05:22.360 --> 00:05:23.500
were able to make a comeback.

00:05:25.510 --> 00:05:27.680
Anran, you're alone

00:05:28.310 --> 00:05:29.700
with no ties,

00:05:30.510 --> 00:05:32.310
so you dare to speak for the people

00:05:32.520 --> 00:05:33.600
and not fear the powerful.

00:05:34.870 --> 00:05:36.630
But that's also why

00:05:36.630 --> 00:05:39.390
they dared to target you.

00:05:42.380 --> 00:05:44.310
You want to advise me

00:05:45.420 --> 00:05:46.760
to choose a good tree to perch on.

00:05:50.390 --> 00:05:54.310
It's just about forming a good alliance.

00:05:55.800 --> 00:05:58.630
If you became my grandson-in-law,

00:05:59.390 --> 00:06:02.800
you would never be demoted again.

00:06:08.340 --> 00:06:11.580
(Capital Prefecture)

00:06:25.310 --> 00:06:26.150
Go back.

00:06:26.720 --> 00:06:27.560
All of you, go.

00:06:28.950 --> 00:06:30.040
It's not time to leave work.

00:06:30.310 --> 00:06:31.640
Yet, you all came to see me off.

00:06:32.190 --> 00:06:33.720
Do you think there's too little work?

00:06:37.120 --> 00:06:37.960
In recent years,

00:06:38.790 --> 00:06:39.840
the head of the Prefecture

00:06:39.840 --> 00:06:40.900
has changed too frequently.

00:06:41.720 --> 00:06:43.050
It's not good for your promotions.

00:06:44.720 --> 00:06:46.240
If I can't get through this time...

00:06:46.240 --> 00:06:47.080
Mr. Lin,

00:06:47.600 --> 00:06:48.600
at a time like this,

00:06:48.600 --> 00:06:49.550
stop thinking about us.

00:06:49.720 --> 00:06:51.040
If I can't get through this,

00:06:51.510 --> 00:06:52.510
I'll try to help you

00:06:53.070 --> 00:06:54.290
get transferred somewhere else.

00:06:56.040 --> 00:06:56.880
Cheng Hu,

00:06:57.280 --> 00:06:58.220
you'll go to the county

00:06:58.310 --> 00:06:59.750
and serve as the Sheriff for a while.

00:06:59.840 --> 00:07:00.880
The salary will be higher,

00:07:01.920 --> 00:07:03.170
and it will add to your resume.

00:07:04.510 --> 00:07:05.430
Second Master Xu,

00:07:05.430 --> 00:07:07.270
I'll recommend you
to the Ministry of Justice.

00:07:07.720 --> 00:07:09.600
So you can hold your head high at home.

00:07:10.120 --> 00:07:10.960
Zhao Jiu...

00:07:11.240 --> 00:07:12.080
Mr. Lin.

00:07:12.550 --> 00:07:13.390
Stop.

00:07:13.450 --> 00:07:14.830
- We'll follow you.
- We'll stay.

00:07:14.900 --> 00:07:16.340
- Mr. Lin.
- We want to follow you.

00:07:16.340 --> 00:07:17.490
We just want to follow you.

00:07:20.920 --> 00:07:21.840
But I can't see you

00:07:21.840 --> 00:07:22.720
waste your time here.

00:07:22.870 --> 00:07:24.360
We aren't wasting our time.

00:07:25.190 --> 00:07:26.030
Mr. Lin.

00:07:26.720 --> 00:07:27.990
With a Vice Prefect like you,

00:07:28.390 --> 00:07:29.800
we've never been afraid.

00:07:30.480 --> 00:07:32.120
No matter what happens,

00:07:32.800 --> 00:07:33.800
we will stick with you

00:07:34.500 --> 00:07:35.780
through thick and thin.

00:07:35.790 --> 00:07:37.240
- Right.
- Right.

00:07:42.660 --> 00:07:45.500
(Capital Prefecture)

00:07:51.580 --> 00:07:55.980
(Yunshui Manor)

00:08:01.990 --> 00:08:02.830
Young Master.

00:08:03.070 --> 00:08:04.390
Lady Shen is here.

00:08:14.660 --> 00:08:16.220
(Yunshui Manor)

00:08:18.920 --> 00:08:19.660
Father and I made

00:08:19.660 --> 00:08:21.480
(Yunshui Manor)
several new flavors of biluo,

00:08:21.480 --> 00:08:22.930
preparing to sell them in the diner.

00:08:23.120 --> 00:08:24.750
Please have a try.

00:08:26.160 --> 00:08:27.000
You already know?

00:08:37.560 --> 00:08:38.990
Your sudden suspension

00:08:39.760 --> 00:08:41.200
must be related to the case, right?

00:08:41.910 --> 00:08:43.360
Did Prince Zhao do this?

00:08:44.750 --> 00:08:45.590
Does your family

00:08:46.120 --> 00:08:46.960
also know about it?

00:08:48.240 --> 00:08:50.270
I received the news from the Princess.

00:08:50.840 --> 00:08:52.080
I haven't told my family

00:08:52.080 --> 00:08:53.120
so as not to worry them.

00:08:53.990 --> 00:08:55.220
Mr. Lin, don't be discouraged.

00:08:55.310 --> 00:08:56.560
Think of it from another angle.

00:08:56.560 --> 00:08:57.750
It might be a good thing.

00:08:57.780 --> 00:08:58.960
The fact that they took action

00:08:58.960 --> 00:09:00.090
as soon as you made progress

00:09:00.270 --> 00:09:01.720
only proves that you're right.

00:09:03.080 --> 00:09:04.030
I'm fine, actually.

00:09:04.840 --> 00:09:06.870
But you and I are cousins.

00:09:06.870 --> 00:09:08.420
Everyone in Yong'an has known about it.

00:09:08.870 --> 00:09:09.960
My suspension

00:09:10.120 --> 00:09:11.670
will inevitably affect you.

00:09:12.270 --> 00:09:13.240
You've also helped a lot

00:09:13.240 --> 00:09:14.390
with the case.

00:09:15.150 --> 00:09:15.990
From now on,

00:09:16.600 --> 00:09:18.120
focus on protecting yourselves.

00:09:19.750 --> 00:09:20.910
When family is in trouble,

00:09:21.400 --> 00:09:23.200
that's the last thing we'd do.

00:09:28.170 --> 00:09:29.320
Mr. Lin, I came today

00:09:29.320 --> 00:09:30.760
because I have something to tell you.

00:09:31.510 --> 00:09:33.870
The trap that Lu Yun set for you
at Yunlai Tavern

00:09:33.870 --> 00:09:35.670
happened because someone
leaked the info.

00:09:35.960 --> 00:09:37.960
Our newly hired chef, Yu San,

00:09:38.120 --> 00:09:39.360
works for Prince Zhao.

00:09:40.510 --> 00:09:41.350
Yu San?

00:09:43.240 --> 00:09:44.080
Where is he?

00:09:44.510 --> 00:09:45.720
Are your family members okay?

00:09:47.900 --> 00:09:49.750
Yu San is not a villain.

00:09:50.120 --> 00:09:51.600
He was coerced by Prince Zhao.

00:09:51.770 --> 00:09:54.150
Prince Zhao held his parents hostage
in Fenglin Town,

00:09:54.320 --> 00:09:56.360
so he had to agree
to work for Prince Zhao.

00:09:56.630 --> 00:09:59.150
If we can rescue his parents,

00:09:59.560 --> 00:10:00.750
he's willing to help us.

00:10:02.790 --> 00:10:03.910
Fenglin Town?

00:10:05.390 --> 00:10:06.510
Can we

00:10:06.720 --> 00:10:07.840
really trust Yu San?

00:10:08.600 --> 00:10:10.080
After years of doing business,

00:10:10.080 --> 00:10:11.960
I've developed a good eye for people.

00:10:12.990 --> 00:10:14.150
I think we can.

00:10:14.480 --> 00:10:15.320
But it concerns...

00:10:15.320 --> 00:10:16.160
I trust you.

00:10:21.710 --> 00:10:23.150
Leave the rest to me.

00:10:23.600 --> 00:10:24.910
I'll head to Fenglin Town asap.

00:10:29.220 --> 00:10:31.380
(Yunshui Manor)

00:10:32.170 --> 00:10:33.240
It's raining hard.

00:10:33.480 --> 00:10:35.120
Please get into the carriage quickly.

00:10:38.370 --> 00:10:40.130
Your sudden suspension

00:10:40.570 --> 00:10:41.960
must be related to the case, right?

00:10:42.230 --> 00:10:43.740
Did Prince Zhao do this?

00:10:48.910 --> 00:10:50.320
Sorry, I have to go back.

00:10:50.320 --> 00:10:51.700
I forgot to tell Mr. Lin something.

00:10:52.360 --> 00:10:54.080
Lady Shen, take the umbrella.

00:10:54.080 --> 00:10:54.920
Thank you.

00:11:16.360 --> 00:11:17.300
Don't come any closer.

00:11:26.860 --> 00:11:27.700
Father...

00:11:28.780 --> 00:11:30.140
Didn't Father die?

00:11:30.380 --> 00:11:31.300
Did I...

00:11:32.060 --> 00:11:33.340
Did I reincarnate

00:11:33.900 --> 00:11:35.460
to see Father once more?

00:11:36.700 --> 00:11:38.540
I can see Father again.

00:11:39.700 --> 00:11:40.900
Father...

00:11:46.140 --> 00:11:48.820
I can see Father again.

00:11:54.140 --> 00:11:55.780
Father...

00:11:58.620 --> 00:11:59.740
From now on,

00:12:00.180 --> 00:12:01.820
you shall be my adopted son.

00:12:02.460 --> 00:12:04.740
You'll have one character as your name,

00:12:05.460 --> 00:12:06.300
like my sons:

00:12:07.380 --> 00:12:08.340
Yan.

00:12:08.340 --> 00:12:09.180
Yes.

00:12:29.220 --> 00:12:30.060
Good.

00:12:30.700 --> 00:12:32.540
Your swordsmanship is getting better.

00:12:34.380 --> 00:12:35.380
You asked the masters

00:12:35.380 --> 00:12:36.860
to teach me swordsmanship.

00:12:37.940 --> 00:12:39.260
I hope I haven't disappointed you.

00:12:39.620 --> 00:12:41.620
You will never disappoint me.

00:12:41.900 --> 00:12:42.740
Are you tired?

00:12:42.900 --> 00:12:43.740
Have a cup of tea.

00:12:48.140 --> 00:12:48.980
Here.

00:12:49.780 --> 00:12:50.820
Thank you, Your Highness.

00:12:57.140 --> 00:12:57.980
Anran,

00:12:58.340 --> 00:12:59.380
I've heard that you want

00:12:59.380 --> 00:13:01.340
to be transferred to Yong'an.

00:13:01.980 --> 00:13:02.940
I think

00:13:02.940 --> 00:13:04.100
that if I can make a name

00:13:04.100 --> 00:13:05.140
for myself in the Capital,

00:13:05.580 --> 00:13:07.160
it won't be a waste of your cultivation.

00:13:08.900 --> 00:13:09.740
Very well.

00:13:12.180 --> 00:13:13.020
Anran,

00:13:13.020 --> 00:13:13.980
I gave you

00:13:13.980 --> 00:13:15.180
your courtesy name.

00:13:17.380 --> 00:13:18.220
Do you know

00:13:19.010 --> 00:13:20.480
what it means?

00:13:23.940 --> 00:13:26.260
You hope that I can live

00:13:26.340 --> 00:13:27.440
a peaceful and smooth life.

00:13:27.500 --> 00:13:28.700
Now in the Capital,

00:13:29.500 --> 00:13:31.020
the situation is full of uncertainties.

00:13:31.380 --> 00:13:32.340
How can you

00:13:32.340 --> 00:13:33.620
make me feel at ease?

00:13:34.580 --> 00:13:35.660
I've already lost

00:13:35.660 --> 00:13:37.980
my most beloved eldest son.

00:13:39.220 --> 00:13:40.580
I don't want to lose you, either.

00:14:32.470 --> 00:14:34.020
Prince Zhao raised you.

00:14:34.730 --> 00:14:37.010
He's like a father to you.

00:14:38.590 --> 00:14:40.100
You found the evidence

00:14:40.780 --> 00:14:42.380
and confirmed that he's the culprit.

00:14:44.860 --> 00:14:46.740
Then he managed to get you suspended.

00:14:48.100 --> 00:14:50.020
You've been too calm about all that.

00:14:50.860 --> 00:14:52.100
If you keep these things inside,

00:14:52.100 --> 00:14:53.880
it can make you sick.

00:14:55.300 --> 00:14:57.540
So, treat me as a tree hole

00:14:57.540 --> 00:14:58.500
and let it out.

00:15:11.860 --> 00:15:12.780
He was so concerned

00:15:14.740 --> 00:15:15.820
about my studies.

00:15:18.260 --> 00:15:19.700
Liu Chang and I escaped death,

00:15:20.890 --> 00:15:21.900
wandering outside.

00:15:23.590 --> 00:15:24.620
My health weakened.

00:15:27.140 --> 00:15:28.220
He was afraid I would die,

00:15:29.540 --> 00:15:31.340
so he hired famous masters

00:15:31.780 --> 00:15:33.680
to teach me martial arts
to strengthen my body.

00:15:35.020 --> 00:15:36.180
He seemed

00:15:37.150 --> 00:15:38.820
so upright and sincere,

00:15:39.460 --> 00:15:42.740
and he taught me
to be loyal to the state

00:15:44.260 --> 00:15:45.740
and uphold righteousness.

00:15:48.140 --> 00:15:48.980
I know

00:15:50.540 --> 00:15:51.900
the reason he treated me this way

00:15:51.900 --> 00:15:52.740
is because I resemble

00:15:54.020 --> 00:15:56.540
his deceased eldest son, Li Sheng.

00:15:59.780 --> 00:16:00.620
Sheng

00:16:01.500 --> 00:16:02.340
and Yan

00:16:05.940 --> 00:16:07.940
both mean brightness.

00:16:11.540 --> 00:16:14.140
Even the courtesy name Anran

00:16:16.420 --> 00:16:18.300
was prepared for Li Sheng.

00:16:22.180 --> 00:16:23.740
But I still appreciate him.

00:16:25.250 --> 00:16:27.370
He saved me from the flames

00:16:27.900 --> 00:16:29.260
and taught me when I was confused.

00:16:31.150 --> 00:16:33.080
But I never expected...

00:16:35.640 --> 00:16:36.980
I just couldn't imagine

00:16:38.060 --> 00:16:40.180
that he had my family's blood
on his hands

00:16:40.180 --> 00:16:42.380
and still pretended to be my family.

00:16:46.660 --> 00:16:47.740
17 years.

00:16:50.300 --> 00:16:51.980
It's been 17 years.

00:16:53.380 --> 00:16:55.260
He preached righteousness,

00:16:55.540 --> 00:16:58.040
yet exterminated my entire clan.

00:17:02.190 --> 00:17:04.210
Who knows how many

00:17:05.180 --> 00:17:07.780
nameless and innocent victims he killed?

00:17:32.140 --> 00:17:33.340
But I feel it's a good thing

00:17:35.580 --> 00:17:38.020
that you resemble
the son he cared about.

00:17:40.020 --> 00:17:42.340
It's a good thing
that when you were defenseless,

00:17:42.660 --> 00:17:44.140
you gave him your true heart

00:17:44.460 --> 00:17:45.540
and survived.

00:17:46.860 --> 00:17:48.700
If you had discovered
the truth early on,

00:17:49.540 --> 00:17:50.940
even if you could pretend,

00:17:51.100 --> 00:17:53.080
your heart would've suffered
too much torment.

00:17:53.860 --> 00:17:55.900
Once a person endures too much pain,

00:17:55.900 --> 00:17:57.860
they lose the ability to feel joy.

00:17:59.260 --> 00:18:00.500
My family,

00:18:00.500 --> 00:18:01.860
your family, and I

00:18:02.580 --> 00:18:04.520
don't want you to be consumed
by revenge.

00:18:05.460 --> 00:18:07.120
Now that you know the truth,

00:18:07.160 --> 00:18:08.900
you've had the ability
to protect yourself

00:18:08.900 --> 00:18:10.260
and deal with the villains.

00:18:11.500 --> 00:18:13.860
This is truly something
to be grateful for.

00:18:28.780 --> 00:18:30.660
You do care about me.

00:18:33.380 --> 00:18:34.220
Jicai,

00:18:36.020 --> 00:18:37.500
I will resolve all of this.

00:18:37.980 --> 00:18:40.060
I won't keep your family
worried forever,

00:18:41.180 --> 00:18:43.020
nor will I let you suffer
in the slightest.

00:18:44.570 --> 00:18:46.580
When all of this is settled,

00:18:47.260 --> 00:18:49.080
I'll formally ask for your hand
in marriage,

00:18:50.260 --> 00:18:51.100
okay?

00:18:52.780 --> 00:18:53.900
It shouldn't be me.

00:18:55.540 --> 00:18:57.060
Mr. Pei has said it.

00:18:57.920 --> 00:18:58.780
You and Mr. Meng...

00:18:58.780 --> 00:18:59.920
Don't believe those rumors.

00:19:00.940 --> 00:19:02.460
Believe me.

00:19:10.140 --> 00:19:12.900
If you became my grandson-in-law,

00:19:13.700 --> 00:19:17.100
you would never be demoted again.

00:19:25.340 --> 00:19:26.500
Thank you for your favor,

00:19:27.500 --> 00:19:28.740
but your move

00:19:29.100 --> 00:19:30.700
only belittles me

00:19:31.340 --> 00:19:32.980
and your granddaughter.

00:19:33.420 --> 00:19:34.500
The Censorate impeached me,

00:19:34.500 --> 00:19:36.220
but I have my way to deal with it.

00:19:36.460 --> 00:19:39.100
Otherwise,
how could I control the Prefecture?

00:19:39.420 --> 00:19:40.780
As for Lady Shen Jingwen,

00:19:41.420 --> 00:19:42.740
she has her own world.

00:19:43.320 --> 00:19:44.460
You should ask her

00:19:45.500 --> 00:19:46.860
what she

00:19:47.460 --> 00:19:48.340
truly wants.

00:19:51.740 --> 00:19:53.060
Apart from a fraudster,

00:19:56.300 --> 00:19:57.140
I do not

00:20:00.490 --> 00:20:01.980
and will not be engaged

00:20:02.380 --> 00:20:03.420
to anyone else.

00:20:40.700 --> 00:20:41.540
Why?

00:20:45.140 --> 00:20:45.980
After all this time,

00:20:45.980 --> 00:20:47.980
I can't figure out what you're thinking.

00:20:48.940 --> 00:20:50.180
But I know myself.

00:21:04.260 --> 00:21:05.100
I know

00:21:06.820 --> 00:21:07.660
that if I miss you,

00:21:09.420 --> 00:21:11.180
I will never find peace in my life.

00:21:14.220 --> 00:21:15.060
What about you?

00:21:25.220 --> 00:21:26.060
Lin Yan,

00:21:28.140 --> 00:21:29.340
do you still remember?

00:21:30.800 --> 00:21:31.740
I told you that I came

00:21:31.740 --> 00:21:34.420
from a place called Future Village.

00:21:36.740 --> 00:21:38.580
In Future Village, there are dishwashers

00:21:39.540 --> 00:21:40.880
and many other things that surpass

00:21:40.880 --> 00:21:42.880
the wonders of this era.

00:21:43.300 --> 00:21:44.380
You asked me why

00:21:44.380 --> 00:21:46.140
I always say strange things

00:21:46.140 --> 00:21:47.780
and do strange things.

00:21:50.060 --> 00:21:51.100
It's because

00:21:52.580 --> 00:21:54.140
my family and I

00:21:54.700 --> 00:21:56.700
do not belong to this era.

00:21:58.940 --> 00:22:00.820
We come from 1,000 in the future.

00:22:01.380 --> 00:22:02.700
If you want to reject me,

00:22:03.660 --> 00:22:04.660
you don't need to weave

00:22:06.380 --> 00:22:07.900
such a ridiculous excuse.

00:22:12.060 --> 00:22:14.340
Yunshui Manor is our ancestral home.

00:22:15.150 --> 00:22:17.270
We came here through the ancestral home.

00:22:31.700 --> 00:22:33.240
Based on the map we saw

00:22:33.240 --> 00:22:35.080
(Yunshui Manor Tourist Map)
at Yunshui Manor,

00:22:35.100 --> 00:22:36.980
the manor is in that direction.

00:22:36.980 --> 00:22:39.420
Since we came through Yunshui Manor,

00:22:39.420 --> 00:22:40.900
(Yunshui Manor)
we need to go there.

00:22:42.220 --> 00:22:43.580
Actually, you're my fiancé.

00:22:44.730 --> 00:22:47.500
I lied and said I was your fiancée

00:22:47.800 --> 00:22:49.220
to live in Yunshui Manor

00:22:49.220 --> 00:22:50.820
and find a way back.

00:22:52.460 --> 00:22:53.300
But we tried

00:22:53.300 --> 00:22:55.380
many times and failed.

00:22:55.680 --> 00:22:56.660
There was no way,

00:22:56.660 --> 00:22:58.020
so we had to stay here.

00:22:59.580 --> 00:23:00.420
And you...

00:23:02.180 --> 00:23:03.500
Our relationship...

00:23:04.810 --> 00:23:06.660
Yunshui Manor is your place,

00:23:06.950 --> 00:23:09.340
and it is our ancestral home,

00:23:09.980 --> 00:23:11.420
so you are our...

00:23:29.140 --> 00:23:30.700
When my grandfather was alive,

00:23:31.180 --> 00:23:33.180
he told us the stories of our ancestor,

00:23:35.740 --> 00:23:37.340
which are your stories.

00:23:38.700 --> 00:23:40.860
That's why I know so much about you.

00:23:41.980 --> 00:23:43.580
I know your surname is Cui,

00:23:43.580 --> 00:23:44.980
and I deceived you,

00:23:45.580 --> 00:23:47.420
pretending to be your fiancée.

00:23:52.580 --> 00:23:55.000
♪Falling into fog♪

00:23:56.900 --> 00:23:58.180
It's too absurd.

00:23:59.940 --> 00:24:01.220
Too absurd.

00:24:01.780 --> 00:24:02.780
This can't be.

00:24:03.660 --> 00:24:05.060
Do you remember the lock

00:24:05.060 --> 00:24:06.320
on the secret door in the study?

00:24:07.980 --> 00:24:09.540
Why couldn't you crack it,

00:24:10.300 --> 00:24:11.980
but I could open it easily?

00:24:12.700 --> 00:24:14.340
Because that lock

00:24:15.740 --> 00:24:18.020
comes from our era.

00:24:19.650 --> 00:24:22.460
♪Where should I go♪

00:24:24.500 --> 00:24:27.220
She opened the lock so easily?

00:24:27.290 --> 00:24:28.340
Today, I'm truly honored

00:24:28.340 --> 00:24:29.620
to meet you.

00:24:29.620 --> 00:24:30.460
Alive...

00:24:30.780 --> 00:24:31.620
He's alive.

00:24:31.980 --> 00:24:33.020
No, no.

00:24:33.020 --> 00:24:34.100
Ancestor.

00:24:34.820 --> 00:24:35.660
Not again.

00:24:35.820 --> 00:24:36.660
To our ancestors,

00:24:36.660 --> 00:24:38.180
may they live long and in good health.

00:24:38.180 --> 00:24:39.500
Future Village?

00:24:39.700 --> 00:24:42.260
A place that has yet to arrive.

00:24:42.260 --> 00:24:44.500
It just needs
another thousand years or so

00:24:44.500 --> 00:24:45.460
for you to see

00:24:45.460 --> 00:24:47.260
the Future Village
where everyone is equal.

00:24:49.690 --> 00:24:53.160
♪You're protecting me by my side♪

00:24:53.420 --> 00:24:57.930

00:25:30.660 --> 00:25:35.140
(Shen's Diner)

00:25:56.900 --> 00:25:58.700
Jicai told Mr. Lin

00:25:58.700 --> 00:26:00.180
everything today.

00:26:00.420 --> 00:26:01.420
Ever since she came back,

00:26:01.420 --> 00:26:02.940
she's been cleaning

00:26:03.100 --> 00:26:04.460
nonstop here.

00:26:04.980 --> 00:26:07.820
The diner is surprisingly clean.

00:26:08.740 --> 00:26:09.900
I mean,

00:26:10.660 --> 00:26:11.860
we should try to persuade her.

00:26:11.900 --> 00:26:13.220
She just got caught in the rain.

00:26:13.220 --> 00:26:14.740
Her health is important.

00:26:14.980 --> 00:26:15.860
Or maybe

00:26:15.860 --> 00:26:17.340
we should just let her vent.

00:26:18.220 --> 00:26:20.500
She was fine
after jumping into the pond.

00:26:20.500 --> 00:26:21.460
Jicai is thin,

00:26:21.660 --> 00:26:23.420
but she's strong.

00:26:24.540 --> 00:26:26.060
She needs this.

00:26:26.740 --> 00:26:27.940
When adults are upset,

00:26:27.940 --> 00:26:29.500
they tend to punish themselves.

00:26:30.020 --> 00:26:31.140
Dad knows this best.

00:26:31.340 --> 00:26:33.580
He did this when Mom left.

00:26:34.020 --> 00:26:36.300
Yangyang, you're right.

00:26:36.620 --> 00:26:38.860
That was the only time
Gongcai ever did any housework.

00:26:39.220 --> 00:26:40.060
Dad...

00:26:40.060 --> 00:26:41.020
Enough.

00:26:41.020 --> 00:26:41.860
Don't worry.

00:26:42.300 --> 00:26:43.940
I know my daughter.

00:26:44.300 --> 00:26:45.420
Give her some time.

00:26:45.420 --> 00:26:46.740
She'll be fine.

00:26:47.460 --> 00:26:48.860
That makes sense.

00:27:16.180 --> 00:27:19.260
(Jicai)

00:27:33.770 --> 00:27:34.820
Oh, my.

00:27:36.450 --> 00:27:37.380
Young Master,

00:27:37.980 --> 00:27:39.380
what are you looking for here?

00:27:39.610 --> 00:27:41.070
It's so dirty. Let me do it.

00:27:44.980 --> 00:27:45.820
Found it.

00:27:50.340 --> 00:27:51.420
(Jicai)

00:27:53.660 --> 00:27:55.900
(Jicai)

00:28:00.700 --> 00:28:01.660
Young Master.

00:28:01.660 --> 00:28:02.500
Young Master,

00:28:02.660 --> 00:28:03.540
I listened to you

00:28:03.700 --> 00:28:05.100
and got close with the Jinwu guards

00:28:05.100 --> 00:28:07.260
who were on duty
on the night Zhao Xunzhi disappeared.

00:28:07.260 --> 00:28:08.100
Guess what?

00:28:10.420 --> 00:28:11.620
(Jicai)

00:28:12.420 --> 00:28:13.260
Young Master,

00:28:14.260 --> 00:28:15.100
are

00:28:16.220 --> 00:28:17.180
you okay?

00:28:21.460 --> 00:28:22.540
Let's get down to business.

00:28:23.660 --> 00:28:24.540
I treated

00:28:24.540 --> 00:28:25.700
those Jinwu guards

00:28:25.700 --> 00:28:26.860
to wine many times.

00:28:26.860 --> 00:28:28.180
Finally, I got some info.

00:28:28.320 --> 00:28:30.020
After the city gates
were locked that day,

00:28:30.020 --> 00:28:31.640
a grocery cart from Yunlai Tavern

00:28:31.660 --> 00:28:32.580
went out.

00:28:33.820 --> 00:28:35.180
Opening the city gates at night?

00:28:36.340 --> 00:28:37.340
Even with a bribe,

00:28:37.340 --> 00:28:38.680
how dare the Jinwu guards do that?

00:28:38.780 --> 00:28:39.900
That's the point.

00:28:40.000 --> 00:28:41.020
There was an eunuch

00:28:41.020 --> 00:28:42.330
in that cart.

00:28:42.520 --> 00:28:44.190
It was related to Noble Consort Dou.

00:28:45.790 --> 00:28:48.340
No wonder the Jinwu guards kept quiet.

00:28:49.000 --> 00:28:49.980
Zhao Xunzhi

00:28:50.760 --> 00:28:52.310
must have been on that cart.

00:28:58.930 --> 00:29:00.090
Hurry up with your work.

00:29:01.000 --> 00:29:01.940
We were ordered

00:29:02.360 --> 00:29:04.440
to deliver these goods
to Fenglin Town by tomorrow.

00:29:05.070 --> 00:29:06.700
The Jinwu guards will come later.

00:29:07.100 --> 00:29:07.940
Hurry up.

00:29:08.780 --> 00:29:09.700
Load the cart. Hurry.

00:29:11.500 --> 00:29:12.340
Hurry.

00:29:12.620 --> 00:29:13.780
Fenglin Town again.

00:29:14.300 --> 00:29:16.180
It seems their base is there.

00:29:16.590 --> 00:29:18.780
Why did you say "again"?

00:29:18.780 --> 00:29:19.750
Early tomorrow,

00:29:19.760 --> 00:29:20.740
I'll go see His Majesty

00:29:21.500 --> 00:29:22.980
and head to Fenglin Town afterward.

00:29:23.730 --> 00:29:24.660
You stay here

00:29:24.670 --> 00:29:26.140
and take care of the Shen family.

00:29:28.820 --> 00:29:29.660
Very well.

00:29:59.140 --> 00:30:03.380
(Jingsi Study)

00:30:04.140 --> 00:30:05.460
Why are you here?

00:30:05.820 --> 00:30:06.780
I'm looking for Mr. Lin.

00:30:07.620 --> 00:30:08.740
He's not here.

00:30:08.940 --> 00:30:10.380
Tell me what you need.

00:30:12.780 --> 00:30:13.990
Actually,

00:30:15.000 --> 00:30:16.380
Jicai has told us everything.

00:30:17.980 --> 00:30:18.820
I know

00:30:19.260 --> 00:30:20.820
that after Mr. Lin was suspended,

00:30:21.040 --> 00:30:22.220
he was in a bad mood

00:30:22.580 --> 00:30:23.940
and had a disagreement

00:30:24.260 --> 00:30:25.460
with Jicai.

00:30:25.640 --> 00:30:26.860
I can understand all of this.

00:30:27.460 --> 00:30:28.820
But that's one thing.

00:30:28.820 --> 00:30:29.900
My career as a mole

00:30:29.900 --> 00:30:30.820
can't just stop.

00:30:30.820 --> 00:30:32.370
What would I do

00:30:32.380 --> 00:30:33.240
with all my talents?

00:30:33.240 --> 00:30:34.700
So, I'm asking Mr. Lin

00:30:34.700 --> 00:30:36.500
if there's anything else
he wants me to do.

00:30:36.500 --> 00:30:37.900
Mr. Lin has given instructions.

00:30:37.900 --> 00:30:39.700
He will handle things.

00:30:39.700 --> 00:30:41.780
You just need
to take care of yourselves.

00:30:41.780 --> 00:30:42.940
How can that be?

00:30:43.980 --> 00:30:45.260
I need to ask him in person.

00:30:45.260 --> 00:30:46.100
Mr. Shen,

00:30:46.300 --> 00:30:47.860
Mr. Lin really isn't here.

00:30:47.860 --> 00:30:49.580
If he's not here,

00:30:49.620 --> 00:30:50.660
I'll wait for him inside.

00:30:50.660 --> 00:30:51.290
When we broke

00:30:51.290 --> 00:30:53.020
(Jingsi Study)
into Yunlai Tavern at night,

00:30:53.020 --> 00:30:54.260
we worked together so well.

00:30:54.260 --> 00:30:55.140
Those glances.

00:30:55.140 --> 00:30:56.300
Those feelings.

00:30:56.300 --> 00:30:58.300
Now, it's the key moment
to solve the case.

00:30:58.360 --> 00:30:59.860
How can he be without me by his side?

00:30:59.860 --> 00:31:01.300
Mr. Lin is not in Yong'an,

00:31:01.300 --> 00:31:02.860
so it's useless for you to wait inside.

00:31:04.140 --> 00:31:06.340
Mr. Lin was demoted and left so soon?

00:31:06.780 --> 00:31:07.820
He's gone

00:31:08.980 --> 00:31:09.820
to Fenglin Town.

00:31:11.380 --> 00:31:12.380
Fenglin Town?

00:31:14.220 --> 00:31:15.980
That sounds so familiar.

00:31:16.540 --> 00:31:18.180
Mr. Lin went to Fenglin Town

00:31:18.180 --> 00:31:19.960
to rescue Mentor Zhao
and Yu San's parents.

00:31:20.000 --> 00:31:20.860
You don't know.

00:31:20.860 --> 00:31:22.420
When I was out working,

00:31:22.420 --> 00:31:24.180
I went to Fenglin Town.

00:31:25.300 --> 00:31:26.140
Back then,

00:31:26.420 --> 00:31:27.540
I was begging there...

00:31:27.860 --> 00:31:28.800
Struggling to survive.

00:31:29.750 --> 00:31:30.620
I walked

00:31:30.620 --> 00:31:31.620
every inch of that land.

00:31:31.620 --> 00:31:32.820
So, I know the local customs

00:31:32.820 --> 00:31:34.070
and the geography of that place

00:31:34.080 --> 00:31:35.060
like the back of my hand.

00:31:35.060 --> 00:31:36.900
No one is more suitable
to help him than me.

00:31:36.980 --> 00:31:38.620
Before my young master left,

00:31:38.620 --> 00:31:39.820
he repeatedly instructed me

00:31:39.820 --> 00:31:41.180
to take good care

00:31:41.180 --> 00:31:42.460
of you.

00:31:42.460 --> 00:31:43.540
How can I just let you go?

00:31:43.540 --> 00:31:44.700
How will I explain to him?

00:31:44.700 --> 00:31:46.300
Lady Shen.

00:31:46.300 --> 00:31:47.660
You must persuade your brother.

00:31:48.320 --> 00:31:49.340
I have to go find Lin Yan.

00:31:53.620 --> 00:31:55.620
(Dou Residence)

00:32:03.060 --> 00:32:05.940
(Dou Residence)

00:32:08.740 --> 00:32:10.180
Where is Zhao Xunzhi being held?

00:33:38.100 --> 00:33:39.100
It's all here.

00:34:02.900 --> 00:34:04.180
Mr. Lin.

00:34:18.820 --> 00:34:19.660
Mentor Zhao.

00:34:20.020 --> 00:34:21.020
Are you alright?

00:34:22.220 --> 00:34:23.420
I'm fine for now.

00:34:23.620 --> 00:34:24.540
Do you know

00:34:24.540 --> 00:34:26.420
where they're holding
the other hostages?

00:34:26.620 --> 00:34:27.820
The guards said

00:34:28.220 --> 00:34:29.620
they're also in Fenglin Town.

00:34:30.940 --> 00:34:31.780
Come with me.

00:35:18.460 --> 00:35:20.700
You actually found your way here.

00:35:21.170 --> 00:35:22.630
Lu Yun, that fool,

00:35:22.640 --> 00:35:24.860
even told my father
you hadn't found anything.

00:35:25.000 --> 00:35:27.160
It seems I know you better after all.

00:35:28.100 --> 00:35:28.940
Lin Yan,

00:35:29.230 --> 00:35:31.420
I've been waiting here all along

00:35:31.740 --> 00:35:32.780
for you.

00:35:34.020 --> 00:35:36.540
It's because you resemble
my eldest brother

00:35:36.540 --> 00:35:37.860
that Father spared your life,

00:35:37.860 --> 00:35:39.580
letting you live these extra years.

00:35:42.100 --> 00:35:43.820
Kill this man

00:35:43.820 --> 00:35:46.500
who should've gone

00:35:47.180 --> 00:35:49.140
to hell 17 years ago.

00:35:56.660 --> 00:35:57.500
Li Ang,

00:35:57.620 --> 00:35:59.460
why give so many orders?

00:36:01.100 --> 00:36:02.460
Who can hear the key point?

00:36:03.460 --> 00:36:05.580
I told you to kill him!

00:36:18.860 --> 00:36:19.700
Attack Zhao.

00:36:19.700 --> 00:36:20.820
He will surely defend.

00:36:42.860 --> 00:36:44.140
Stop it, all of you.

00:36:44.900 --> 00:36:46.140
Father watched you learn

00:36:46.140 --> 00:36:47.820
your swordsmanship.

00:36:48.380 --> 00:36:50.100
He never treated me like this.

00:36:51.180 --> 00:36:53.780
Today, I will personally disable you

00:36:54.440 --> 00:36:56.460
and bring you before Father,

00:36:56.460 --> 00:36:58.580
so he can see

00:36:58.580 --> 00:37:01.100
how useless you are.

00:37:01.820 --> 00:37:02.700
Scatter.

00:37:38.220 --> 00:37:39.060
Slow down.

00:37:45.020 --> 00:37:45.860
Mr. Lin,

00:37:47.290 --> 00:37:48.840
hold on a little longer,

00:37:48.850 --> 00:37:49.910
okay?

00:37:50.700 --> 00:37:51.540
Come on.

00:38:07.810 --> 00:38:08.730
Be careful.

00:38:10.420 --> 00:38:11.260
Someone's coming.

00:38:14.140 --> 00:38:14.980
- Lin Yan.
- That...

00:38:15.580 --> 00:38:16.420
Mr. Lin!

00:38:17.100 --> 00:38:17.940
Lin Yan!

00:38:26.860 --> 00:38:27.700
Lin Yan.

00:38:29.540 --> 00:38:30.460
Lin Yan.

00:38:30.460 --> 00:38:31.980
It's okay now; I'm here.

00:38:31.980 --> 00:38:32.820
It's okay.

00:38:33.220 --> 00:38:34.500
It's okay now; I'm here.

00:38:34.740 --> 00:38:36.340
Yu San's parents

00:38:37.780 --> 00:38:39.140
are being held

00:38:39.990 --> 00:38:42.260
somewhere else in Fenglin Town.

00:38:45.060 --> 00:38:46.580
Mentor Zhao knows.

00:38:47.580 --> 00:38:48.900
Let Cheng Hu

00:38:50.380 --> 00:38:53.180
take people to rescue them.

00:38:56.860 --> 00:38:58.060
Liu Chang will be here soon.

00:38:58.220 --> 00:38:59.500
Hold on a little longer.

00:38:59.740 --> 00:39:01.060
He's right behind us.

00:39:01.220 --> 00:39:02.580
Don't fall asleep. Hold on.

00:39:11.220 --> 00:39:14.900
