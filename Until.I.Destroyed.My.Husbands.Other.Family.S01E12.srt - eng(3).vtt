WEBVTT

00:00:12.612 --> 00:00:13.980
Wataru...

00:00:21.421 --> 00:00:22.589
No.

00:00:23.957 --> 00:00:25.325
Wataru.

00:00:48.314 --> 00:00:49.716
Yudai...

00:00:53.620 --> 00:00:54.854
Mom.

00:00:56.656 --> 00:00:57.824
Let's stop.

00:00:59.325 --> 00:01:00.727
We have to stop this.

00:01:02.729 --> 00:01:04.130
We lost everything.

00:01:05.465 --> 00:01:06.633
Work, money...

00:01:07.434 --> 00:01:08.935
people's trust...

00:01:10.336 --> 00:01:12.272
everything.

00:01:13.973 --> 00:01:15.275
And it's all...

00:01:16.676 --> 00:01:18.578
all our fault.

00:01:20.346 --> 00:01:21.681
No!

00:01:22.916 --> 00:01:24.184
We destroyed

00:01:25.718 --> 00:01:27.187
Minori's life.

00:01:28.088 --> 00:01:29.823
We screwed up

00:01:30.723 --> 00:01:32.092
everyone's life!

00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:37.363
What we did can't be undone.

00:01:39.699 --> 00:01:41.034
This is the fallout.

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:45.004
Stop it.

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:48.408
We have to atone

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:52.579
for what we've done.

00:02:04.424 --> 00:02:06.793
- Yudai!
- Yudai, are you okay?

00:02:07.694 --> 00:02:09.395
It's not my fault.

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:11.131
Not my fault!

00:02:11.965 --> 00:02:12.999
Mom!

00:02:20.373 --> 00:02:21.407
Minori.

00:02:25.778 --> 00:02:27.514
I'm sorry for what we did.

00:02:33.319 --> 00:02:34.621
Yudai...

00:02:58.244 --> 00:02:59.946
Susumu Tsukishiro!

00:03:02.248 --> 00:03:03.516
Why?

00:03:03.583 --> 00:03:05.485
I underestimated you.

00:03:06.152 --> 00:03:09.789
I never thought you were
this relentless.

00:03:10.557 --> 00:03:14.561
No! It's all that woman's fault!

00:03:14.627 --> 00:03:15.828
That woman?

00:03:17.997 --> 00:03:19.165
You mean

00:03:19.799 --> 00:03:22.635
my dear daughter?

00:03:24.103 --> 00:03:25.338
Dad!

00:03:27.941 --> 00:03:30.910
Sorry I'm late. Is everything okay?

00:03:31.678 --> 00:03:33.346
Mm-hmm.

00:03:35.181 --> 00:03:36.716
Off to the police, then.

00:03:39.686 --> 00:03:44.857
Wait, what are you doing to me?
Stop it! Let me go!

00:03:46.859 --> 00:03:48.094
Please wait!

00:03:51.631 --> 00:03:52.799
I'll go with her.

00:03:57.503 --> 00:03:58.571
Minori.

00:04:00.540 --> 00:04:01.874
I'm truly sorry.

00:04:09.582 --> 00:04:10.583
It's okay.

00:04:13.553 --> 00:04:14.954
How's your hand?

00:04:16.689 --> 00:04:17.690
Fine.

00:04:19.492 --> 00:04:23.930
From now on, I'll make sure
to keep an eye on Mom.

00:04:24.931 --> 00:04:26.099
And I promise

00:04:27.333 --> 00:04:28.401
I'll never

00:04:29.435 --> 00:04:31.938
show my face here again,
so don't worry.

00:04:42.482 --> 00:04:44.083
All right, I'm off.

00:04:47.487 --> 00:04:48.554
Yudai!

00:04:57.664 --> 00:04:58.798
Thanks

00:05:01.334 --> 00:05:02.535
for everything

00:05:05.471 --> 00:05:06.606
Minori...

00:05:10.743 --> 00:05:12.245
Take care of yourself.

00:05:18.151 --> 00:05:19.218
I will.

00:05:42.775 --> 00:05:46.379
I'm so glad you're okay.

00:05:47.914 --> 00:05:48.915
Mm-hmm.

00:05:50.917 --> 00:05:52.652
You protected me. Thank you.

00:05:54.687 --> 00:05:55.722
No.

00:05:57.090 --> 00:05:59.125
I couldn't do anything.

00:06:01.561 --> 00:06:02.895
That's not true!

00:06:05.798 --> 00:06:06.833
Huh?

00:06:11.337 --> 00:06:12.538
You were there.

00:06:13.806 --> 00:06:14.941
Thank you.

00:06:17.176 --> 00:06:18.277
Minori...

00:06:43.870 --> 00:06:44.937
Yeah?

00:06:46.139 --> 00:06:47.440
I'm going to die.

00:06:48.975 --> 00:06:49.976
What?

00:06:53.346 --> 00:06:54.580
You're going to die?

00:06:56.916 --> 00:06:58.317
Wait! Hold on!

00:07:00.186 --> 00:07:01.487
Mom?

00:07:50.336 --> 00:07:54.941
UNTIL I DESTROYED MY HUSBAND'S
OTHER FAMILY

00:07:56.909 --> 00:07:57.977
Mom?

00:08:08.988 --> 00:08:10.823
Wataru!

00:08:14.827 --> 00:08:17.029
You are late!

00:08:18.865 --> 00:08:21.634
Why is that woman here?

00:08:23.102 --> 00:08:24.937
Oh, whatever!

00:08:27.006 --> 00:08:30.776
I knew you'd come to me.

00:08:32.879 --> 00:08:35.414
I'm not a bad actress, right?

00:08:40.353 --> 00:08:41.687
What the hell is this?

00:08:43.189 --> 00:08:44.924
What do you want?

00:08:48.160 --> 00:08:53.366
I know you better than anybody
in the whole world.

00:08:55.034 --> 00:09:00.406
I really do!
Way, way, way more than that woman!

00:09:06.546 --> 00:09:07.914
Wataru.

00:09:11.183 --> 00:09:14.120
You can't abandon me.

00:09:19.525 --> 00:09:20.860
Those eyes...

00:09:21.961 --> 00:09:23.896
Just like his eyes.

00:09:24.964 --> 00:09:26.132
Who?

00:09:27.133 --> 00:09:28.467
Your...

00:09:29.368 --> 00:09:31.370
real dad.

00:09:38.778 --> 00:09:42.214
The first time I met your dad

00:09:44.317 --> 00:09:45.585
I fell in love.

00:09:46.586 --> 00:09:48.020
My first love.

00:09:48.921 --> 00:09:52.959
I thought he'd be the one forever--
my first and my last.

00:09:58.965 --> 00:10:00.099
But

00:10:01.267 --> 00:10:03.936
when I got pregnant with you

00:10:05.538 --> 00:10:07.840
he cut ties with me.

00:10:10.042 --> 00:10:11.611
I went looking for him

00:10:12.244 --> 00:10:15.448
at my university, and you know what?

00:10:17.450 --> 00:10:18.451
He was

00:10:20.186 --> 00:10:22.054
holding hands with

00:10:22.922 --> 00:10:25.658
someone I didn't know!

00:10:34.767 --> 00:10:37.403
I hated him so much!

00:10:38.671 --> 00:10:41.641
I dreamed of killing him
so many times!

00:10:51.450 --> 00:10:52.818
But...

00:10:54.887 --> 00:10:57.256
I still loved him

00:10:58.624 --> 00:11:00.459
just as badly.

00:11:10.836 --> 00:11:12.271
So

00:11:12.338 --> 00:11:15.374
I never once hesitated to have you.

00:11:16.475 --> 00:11:18.978
I devoted my whole life

00:11:20.146 --> 00:11:22.048
to protecting you.

00:11:24.750 --> 00:11:26.252
Wataru.

00:11:30.623 --> 00:11:33.359
You were all I had.

00:11:35.394 --> 00:11:36.462
And

00:11:37.496 --> 00:11:40.299
Yudai was kind so I clung to him

00:11:42.101 --> 00:11:44.704
to keep you safe!

00:11:47.506 --> 00:11:48.808
Is that

00:11:51.477 --> 00:11:53.546
really so wrong?

00:11:56.415 --> 00:11:59.351
Wrong enough
that I'd lose everything?

00:12:05.424 --> 00:12:06.992
Was I so bad?

00:12:11.097 --> 00:12:13.099
- Mom.
- Everything's gone.

00:12:16.001 --> 00:12:17.403
I lost Yudai

00:12:19.105 --> 00:12:21.440
my work, Reika's trust...

00:12:26.178 --> 00:12:29.949
Haven't I been punished enough?

00:12:38.424 --> 00:12:40.426
So Wataru.

00:12:42.995 --> 00:12:45.931
I need you to stay with me.

00:12:46.899 --> 00:12:48.501
Please!

00:12:53.172 --> 00:12:55.007
Don't make excuses.

00:12:57.877 --> 00:12:59.044
What?

00:13:00.813 --> 00:13:02.882
You knew all that...

00:13:05.384 --> 00:13:06.819
so why?

00:13:10.356 --> 00:13:13.025
How could you not see

00:13:15.127 --> 00:13:17.897
how much Minori would be hurt?

00:13:25.271 --> 00:13:27.106
Why?

00:13:29.408 --> 00:13:32.178
Why do I always get the blame?

00:13:36.015 --> 00:13:37.650
That woman...

00:13:38.350 --> 00:13:40.352
she took you from me!

00:13:40.920 --> 00:13:43.722
You promised you'd give him back!

00:13:44.323 --> 00:13:47.493
You took him! How are you any
different from me?

00:13:47.560 --> 00:13:48.761
Mom!

00:14:03.375 --> 00:14:04.543
What?

00:14:05.511 --> 00:14:06.946
Hit me again?

00:14:08.681 --> 00:14:11.317
Or push me off from here?

00:14:12.451 --> 00:14:13.452
Fine.

00:14:14.153 --> 00:14:15.387
Go ahead!

00:14:16.488 --> 00:14:18.724
I don't care about my life anymore--

00:14:29.568 --> 00:14:31.470
I want to hit you!

00:14:34.707 --> 00:14:38.911
Because you hurt me!
So I want to hurt you!

00:14:39.578 --> 00:14:43.382
I knew taking revenge
wouldn't change anything but...

00:14:49.488 --> 00:14:50.823
But then...

00:14:52.591 --> 00:14:55.027
who's there to save me?

00:14:58.230 --> 00:14:59.331
So

00:14:59.999 --> 00:15:03.569
I destroyed everything
to get Yudai back!

00:15:05.504 --> 00:15:07.740
But I couldn't trust him anymore.

00:15:08.974 --> 00:15:10.776
I wanted to, but I couldn't.

00:15:13.078 --> 00:15:14.680
I got what I deserved

00:15:15.714 --> 00:15:19.652
for being selfish, for dragging
Tsubasa and Wataru into this

00:15:21.587 --> 00:15:23.088
and for hurting them.

00:15:28.661 --> 00:15:30.095
You're the same.

00:15:32.531 --> 00:15:33.799
So I won't

00:15:34.767 --> 00:15:36.435
feel sorry for you.

00:15:40.606 --> 00:15:44.543
We both hurt the ones we care about
more than our own lives.

00:15:48.213 --> 00:15:50.349
You want to be happy?

00:15:52.985 --> 00:15:54.853
You want to be saved?

00:15:57.256 --> 00:16:00.292
We no longer have the right
to even think about that.

00:16:10.469 --> 00:16:11.637
Then...

00:16:14.273 --> 00:16:16.342
how am I supposed to go on?

00:16:46.638 --> 00:16:47.873
Wataru...

00:17:02.287 --> 00:17:03.422
Mom...

00:17:05.324 --> 00:17:06.358
I...

00:17:08.827 --> 00:17:10.929
I promise I'll be happy.

00:17:15.567 --> 00:17:16.635
So...

00:17:19.104 --> 00:17:20.439
from now on...

00:17:23.976 --> 00:17:26.378
let me walk on my own path.

00:17:40.125 --> 00:17:41.326
Mom.

00:17:44.396 --> 00:17:45.864
Take care of yourself.

00:17:57.543 --> 00:17:58.644
I'm sorry.

00:18:02.414 --> 00:18:04.083
I'm really sorry.

00:18:06.919 --> 00:18:08.854
Forgive me!

00:18:13.292 --> 00:18:15.727
I'm sorry...

00:18:35.013 --> 00:18:37.649
I'm back.

00:18:38.283 --> 00:18:39.551
There she is!

00:18:40.352 --> 00:18:41.353
Minori!

00:18:43.589 --> 00:18:44.623
Huh?

00:18:45.724 --> 00:18:48.460
Hey, sorry about the other day.

00:18:50.529 --> 00:18:52.164
We kind of avoided you.

00:18:53.065 --> 00:18:56.401
We'd just seen that post.
It really shocked us.

00:18:57.803 --> 00:19:00.606
No, I'm sorry it shocked you.

00:19:01.273 --> 00:19:05.511
It's okay. Mr. Taguchi said
it was all a misunderstanding.

00:19:06.712 --> 00:19:08.514
Mr. Taguchi did?

00:19:08.580 --> 00:19:12.818
We figured, well, obviously...
you wouldn't do something like that.

00:19:15.854 --> 00:19:17.523
I'll throw a high one!

00:19:17.589 --> 00:19:18.590
There!

00:19:19.091 --> 00:19:22.661
I wanted to thank you about the post.

00:19:22.728 --> 00:19:25.464
I heard you explained it to them.

00:19:25.531 --> 00:19:29.468
Don't mention it. I was worried
I might be overstepping.

00:19:29.535 --> 00:19:31.336
But I just wanted to help.

00:19:31.403 --> 00:19:33.172
You did. I appreciate it.

00:19:34.006 --> 00:19:36.074
Then, I'm glad.

00:19:46.285 --> 00:19:47.719
What are you going to do

00:19:49.488 --> 00:19:50.856
about Mr. Miyake?

00:19:57.663 --> 00:19:58.764
To me...

00:20:00.699 --> 00:20:01.900
it looks like

00:20:02.634 --> 00:20:05.437
you're willingly punishing yourself.

00:20:07.873 --> 00:20:08.907
So you're...

00:20:11.076 --> 00:20:13.845
holding back your feelings
for Mr. Miyake...

00:20:16.648 --> 00:20:17.849
even though...

00:20:19.585 --> 00:20:21.353
there's nothing standing

00:20:22.120 --> 00:20:23.589
between you two.

00:20:25.591 --> 00:20:26.725
Minori.

00:20:30.329 --> 00:20:33.165
Isn't it time you let yourself
be forgiven?

00:20:36.168 --> 00:20:37.502
Let myself...

00:20:38.403 --> 00:20:39.638
be forgiven?

00:20:44.009 --> 00:20:45.744
Your happiness means

00:20:46.245 --> 00:20:48.380
Tsubasa's happiness, right?

00:20:53.285 --> 00:20:55.187
Daddy! Can you join us?

00:20:55.921 --> 00:20:57.689
Sure. Let's play.

00:20:59.858 --> 00:21:01.059
Minori.

00:21:01.560 --> 00:21:04.663
Let's make ourselves happier, okay?

00:21:07.633 --> 00:21:08.734
Want me to throw?

00:21:13.939 --> 00:21:17.376
CLOSED

00:21:41.233 --> 00:21:42.334
Here you go.

00:21:42.901 --> 00:21:44.269
Thanks.

00:21:44.803 --> 00:21:46.071
I appreciate it.

00:21:50.208 --> 00:21:52.411
I went to see my mom today.

00:21:53.478 --> 00:21:55.814
Did you? How's she?

00:21:56.648 --> 00:21:58.383
She's much calmer.

00:21:59.084 --> 00:22:02.321
She and Reika will stay
at her parents' for a while.

00:22:03.588 --> 00:22:04.690
I see.

00:22:06.625 --> 00:22:09.394
So you wanted to talk about
something?

00:22:33.785 --> 00:22:35.487
Summer is almost over.

00:22:38.056 --> 00:22:39.057
Yes?

00:22:41.326 --> 00:22:43.095
It's been seven years...

00:22:52.971 --> 00:22:54.339
You know, Wataru.

00:22:55.874 --> 00:22:56.975
Yes?

00:23:03.915 --> 00:23:05.484
I used to be

00:23:07.018 --> 00:23:08.687
ridiculously naive.

00:23:09.588 --> 00:23:11.556
So completely trusting.

00:23:13.925 --> 00:23:15.193
Pure

00:23:15.861 --> 00:23:17.162
and honest.

00:23:19.264 --> 00:23:20.632
Just like you.

00:23:25.937 --> 00:23:27.439
When I'm with you

00:23:29.808 --> 00:23:31.309
I feel like

00:23:33.678 --> 00:23:36.014
maybe I can be pure again.

00:23:38.150 --> 00:23:40.152
Maybe I can be allowed

00:23:42.554 --> 00:23:43.722
to live like that.

00:23:47.192 --> 00:23:48.593
Like in those days

00:23:50.996 --> 00:23:52.964
when I loved someone

00:23:55.267 --> 00:23:56.735
without fear or doubt.

00:24:01.907 --> 00:24:03.008
But...

00:24:05.544 --> 00:24:08.246
I know I shouldn't wish that.

00:24:18.123 --> 00:24:19.925
Because my heart is black.

00:24:23.962 --> 00:24:26.198
I don't want to hurt you again.

00:24:28.467 --> 00:24:30.735
I don't want to taint you
the way I am.

00:24:39.344 --> 00:24:40.445
But...

00:24:47.152 --> 00:24:48.320
if...

00:24:50.422 --> 00:24:51.890
if I can be forgiven.

00:24:55.894 --> 00:24:58.463
If I can be honest
about my feelings...

00:25:04.302 --> 00:25:05.437
I...

00:25:09.274 --> 00:25:10.742
I love you.

00:25:16.281 --> 00:25:17.516
Wataru...

00:25:21.052 --> 00:25:22.654
I love you.

00:25:45.510 --> 00:25:46.578
Minori.

00:25:55.253 --> 00:25:56.354
I...

00:25:58.290 --> 00:26:00.458
No matter how black your heart is

00:26:02.193 --> 00:26:05.664
no matter how much
I get hurt or tainted

00:26:09.134 --> 00:26:10.502
I'm going to...

00:26:12.437 --> 00:26:13.972
keep loving you.

00:26:19.244 --> 00:26:20.412
Minori.

00:26:24.516 --> 00:26:25.784
I love you.

00:26:31.756 --> 00:26:32.958
And I...

00:26:36.127 --> 00:26:37.262
love you.

00:26:40.699 --> 00:26:41.866
I love you.

00:26:44.869 --> 00:26:47.405
- I love you.
- I love you.

00:26:48.173 --> 00:26:49.341
I love you!

00:27:03.521 --> 00:27:04.623
So I need to ask.

00:27:06.458 --> 00:27:07.659
Can you give me

00:27:09.794 --> 00:27:11.296
a little time?

00:27:14.232 --> 00:27:15.266
What?

00:27:16.001 --> 00:27:17.035
I...

00:27:18.269 --> 00:27:20.171
I'm thinking about leaving here.

00:27:24.275 --> 00:27:25.377
Why?

00:27:27.178 --> 00:27:28.446
Right now, I'm not...

00:27:30.382 --> 00:27:32.017
capable of protecting you.

00:27:33.652 --> 00:27:34.719
I...

00:27:36.855 --> 00:27:38.590
want to be stronger.

00:27:40.792 --> 00:27:42.193
I want to build

00:27:43.895 --> 00:27:45.997
my own life.

00:27:48.500 --> 00:27:49.768
I want to

00:27:51.002 --> 00:27:52.504
make you truly happy.

00:27:59.277 --> 00:28:00.378
So...

00:28:03.048 --> 00:28:05.684
can you have faith in me

00:28:08.053 --> 00:28:09.688
and wait

00:28:11.890 --> 00:28:13.491
until I'm worthy of you?

00:28:30.275 --> 00:28:31.476
Okay.

00:28:44.823 --> 00:28:46.591
It's hot today, isn't it?

00:28:48.727 --> 00:28:50.662
Mom, you know what happened?

00:28:52.097 --> 00:28:53.498
Tsubasa said to me...

00:28:54.065 --> 00:28:56.167
- See you later.
- Going out?

00:28:56.234 --> 00:28:57.368
Where?

00:28:57.969 --> 00:28:59.003
Huh?

00:28:59.804 --> 00:29:02.073
- To the aquarium.
- With who?

00:29:03.041 --> 00:29:04.542
My friend.

00:29:04.609 --> 00:29:05.944
Hmm...

00:29:07.045 --> 00:29:08.313
Hey, wait!

00:29:09.280 --> 00:29:11.015
- Your hair--
- What?

00:29:11.082 --> 00:29:12.383
- Sticking up.
- Don't!

00:29:12.984 --> 00:29:14.185
What's wrong?

00:29:14.686 --> 00:29:16.254
Leave it! I did it myself.

00:29:16.321 --> 00:29:18.656
You did? Why?

00:29:19.557 --> 00:29:20.825
None of your business.

00:29:20.892 --> 00:29:23.294
- Why? Just tell me!
- You're annoying.

00:29:24.062 --> 00:29:25.497
Anno...

00:29:25.563 --> 00:29:27.932
Tsubasa! Recently, you...

00:29:27.999 --> 00:29:30.168
Okay, I get it. I'm late. Gotta go.

00:29:33.037 --> 00:29:34.572
Hey, Tsubasa!

00:29:37.408 --> 00:29:38.443
Sorry I'm late.

00:29:38.510 --> 00:29:39.511
Good morning!

00:29:40.311 --> 00:29:42.647
Hey, your hair's sticking up!

00:29:43.648 --> 00:29:45.884
- What?
- I'll fix it.

00:29:47.452 --> 00:29:49.087
That's love.

00:29:50.355 --> 00:29:51.356
Sara!

00:29:51.422 --> 00:29:52.690
Long time no see!

00:29:54.325 --> 00:29:55.593
You went solo?

00:29:56.261 --> 00:29:58.062
Congratulations!

00:29:58.129 --> 00:30:01.399
Thanks. If you're ever in trouble,
come to me.

00:30:02.634 --> 00:30:05.370
You've already helped me enough.

00:30:05.436 --> 00:30:06.704
That's true.

00:30:08.506 --> 00:30:12.410
Oh, by the way,
what's Miyake up to these days?

00:30:13.311 --> 00:30:15.213
Running a learning hub in Tokyo.

00:30:15.280 --> 00:30:16.681
A leaning hub? Wow.

00:30:17.315 --> 00:30:19.851
To offer a safe place for kids

00:30:19.918 --> 00:30:22.887
who've stopped going to school
for various reasons.

00:30:26.357 --> 00:30:27.559
Do you ever see him?

00:30:28.326 --> 00:30:29.394
No.

00:30:29.894 --> 00:30:32.197
- Not since then.
- I see.

00:30:33.431 --> 00:30:36.067
And Tsubasa's growing up fast.

00:30:36.768 --> 00:30:38.236
- You okay?
- Huh?

00:30:38.970 --> 00:30:40.305
Not lonely?

00:30:42.307 --> 00:30:43.541
I'm not.

00:30:47.512 --> 00:30:48.613
Because...

00:30:49.681 --> 00:30:53.351
I'm glad to see everyone taking
steps, growing

00:30:53.418 --> 00:30:56.521
and moving forward on their own.

00:30:57.755 --> 00:31:00.058
It makes me want to work hard, too.

00:31:01.793 --> 00:31:03.061
Minori...

00:31:05.263 --> 00:31:06.898
You've become strong.

00:31:12.337 --> 00:31:13.504
Do you think

00:31:15.740 --> 00:31:17.942
I'm moving forward like them?

00:31:21.079 --> 00:31:22.146
Minori?

00:31:23.982 --> 00:31:25.283
Dad.

00:31:26.217 --> 00:31:28.119
- You came, too.
- Yeah.

00:31:48.172 --> 00:31:50.041
Is she doing okay?

00:31:52.810 --> 00:31:54.846
You mean Hiromi Kisaragi?

00:31:56.981 --> 00:31:58.883
Are you still concerned

00:31:59.751 --> 00:32:01.352
about that woman?

00:32:03.821 --> 00:32:07.258
Because she was once family.

00:32:10.295 --> 00:32:12.864
To be honest, I was surprised

00:32:13.564 --> 00:32:15.133
when you didn't press charges

00:32:16.200 --> 00:32:17.635
because, unfortunately

00:32:18.436 --> 00:32:20.538
some people never change.

00:32:24.375 --> 00:32:25.710
She can change.

00:32:27.078 --> 00:32:28.346
My mother-in-law...

00:32:31.015 --> 00:32:32.183
You might be right.

00:32:34.719 --> 00:32:37.155
I guess I'll try to be supportive.

00:32:38.656 --> 00:32:39.857
Thank you.

00:32:43.027 --> 00:32:44.095
Sorry.

00:32:47.665 --> 00:32:48.700
Yes?

00:32:50.068 --> 00:32:51.769
Okay. I'll be there.

00:32:53.071 --> 00:32:55.039
Do you have to go?

00:32:55.807 --> 00:32:57.408
A meeting. It's important.

00:32:58.443 --> 00:33:01.346
Let me take you out to dinner
sometime.

00:33:03.181 --> 00:33:04.282
Okay.

00:33:12.857 --> 00:33:15.293
- Minori?
- Hmm?

00:33:18.229 --> 00:33:20.131
Your face has softened.

00:33:22.400 --> 00:33:23.601
Huh?

00:33:26.671 --> 00:33:28.473
The way your eyes look now...

00:33:30.942 --> 00:33:32.810
it's just like Miyuki's.

00:34:01.472 --> 00:34:04.175
We all do wrong.

00:34:06.044 --> 00:34:07.945
Whether through betrayal

00:34:09.614 --> 00:34:11.516
or vengeance

00:34:14.052 --> 00:34:16.587
we hurt those dearest to us

00:34:17.955 --> 00:34:20.291
and in doing so, we hurt ourselves.

00:34:22.827 --> 00:34:24.228
And the wounds we leave

00:34:26.597 --> 00:34:28.833
never truly heal.

00:34:31.803 --> 00:34:33.071
Damn it.

00:34:33.571 --> 00:34:35.907
I shouldn't be doing this.

00:34:35.973 --> 00:34:39.143
- Hello.
- Hello!

00:34:41.512 --> 00:34:43.214
That's her.

00:34:43.815 --> 00:34:46.317
She blackmailed the chairman's
daughter?

00:34:46.384 --> 00:34:48.820
- Yes.
- She sure looks like a criminal!

00:34:48.886 --> 00:34:51.489
Keep it down.

00:34:51.556 --> 00:34:52.757
Scary, isn't she?

00:34:54.659 --> 00:34:55.927
Shut up!

00:34:56.527 --> 00:34:58.329
You ugly bitches!

00:34:58.396 --> 00:35:00.331
But...

00:35:00.398 --> 00:35:03.301
we keep making mistakes

00:35:04.602 --> 00:35:06.771
even though we know deep down.

00:35:08.573 --> 00:35:11.209
Riko! Can you give me a hand?

00:35:11.275 --> 00:35:12.410
Sure.

00:35:16.848 --> 00:35:19.283
GOING TO MAHIRO'S FOR A PLAYDATE.

00:35:20.485 --> 00:35:21.686
And yet

00:35:23.955 --> 00:35:25.923
life goes on.

00:35:26.524 --> 00:35:28.960
Riko, hurry up!

00:35:29.026 --> 00:35:30.261
I'm sorry.

00:35:31.095 --> 00:35:32.697
Excuse me.

00:35:36.367 --> 00:35:38.870
When we forgive the past that
wounded us

00:35:45.776 --> 00:35:48.613
Ugh, she packed string beans again.

00:35:49.213 --> 00:35:51.949
- She messing with me?
- Got caught cheating?

00:35:52.016 --> 00:35:53.317
- Eat it!
- No, man.

00:35:53.384 --> 00:35:55.586
- You like string beans.
- Can I have it?

00:35:56.087 --> 00:35:57.088
Huh?

00:35:57.622 --> 00:36:00.458
If you're not going to eat it, can I?

00:36:00.958 --> 00:36:02.760
Oh, sure.

00:36:03.327 --> 00:36:04.629
Thank you.

00:36:13.538 --> 00:36:15.106
It's good.

00:36:16.440 --> 00:36:18.209
And someday

00:36:19.777 --> 00:36:23.314
when we can forgive ourselves
for the pain we caused...

00:36:43.334 --> 00:36:44.435
Minori.

00:36:49.073 --> 00:36:51.275
we might be able to find

00:36:53.945 --> 00:36:56.914
a sliver of happiness.

00:37:01.519 --> 00:37:02.687
Welcome home.
